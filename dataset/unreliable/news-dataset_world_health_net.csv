The following is direct from the agency’s website:

""Person-to-person spread

The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.

Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).

Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.

These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.

The virus spreads easily between people

How easily a virus spreads from person-to-person can vary. Some viruses are highly contagious, like measles, while other viruses do not spread as easily. Another factor is whether the spread is sustained, which means it goes from person-to-person without stopping.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is spreading very easily and sustainably between people. Information from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic suggests that this virus is spreading more efficiently than influenza, but not as efficiently as measles, which is highly contagious.

The virus does not spread easily in other ways

COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about how it spreads. It may be possible for COVID-19 to spread in other ways, but these are not thought to be the main ways the virus spreads.

From touching surfaces or objects. It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus.

From animals to people. At this time, the risk of COVID-19 spreading from animals to people is considered to be low. Learn about COVID-19 and pets and other animals .

From people to animals. It appears that the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread from people to animals in some situations. CDC is aware of a small number of pets worldwide, including cats and dogs, reported to be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, mostly after close contact with people with COVID-19. Learn what you should do if you have pets .

Protect yourself and others

The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus. You can take steps to slow the spread.

Maintain good social distance (about 6 feet). This is very important in preventing the spread of COVID-19.

Wash your hands often with soap and water. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Routinely clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces.

Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at higher risk for developing serious complications from COVID-19 illness. More information on Are you at higher risk for serious illness.

Know how it spreads, the best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus which is thought to spread mainly from person to person.

Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).

Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks.

These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.

Some recent studies have suggested that COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.

Everyone Should

Wash your hands often

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.

If soap and water are not readily available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Cover all surfaces of your hands and rub them together until they feel dry.

Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.

Avoid close contact

Avoid close contact with people who are sick, even inside your home. If possible, maintain 6 feet between the person who is sick and other household members.

Put distance between yourself and other people outside of your home.

Remember that some people without symptoms may be able to spread virus.



Stay at least 6 feet (about 2 arms’ length) from other people .



Do not gather in groups.



Stay out of crowded places and avoid mass gatherings.



Keeping distance from others is especially important for people who are at higher risk of getting very sick .

Cover your mouth and nose with a cloth face cover when around others

You could spread COVID-19 to others even if you do not feel sick.

Everyone should wear a cloth face cover when they have to go out in public, for example to the grocery store or to pick up other necessities.

Cloth face coverings should not be placed on young children under age 2, anyone who has trouble breathing, or is unconscious, incapacitated or otherwise unable to remove the mask without assistance.

The cloth face cover is meant to protect other people in case you are infected.

Do NOT use a facemask meant for a healthcare worker.

Continue to keep about 6 feet between yourself and others. The cloth face cover is not a substitute for social distancing.

Cover coughs and sneezes

If you are in a private setting and do not have on your cloth face covering, remember to always cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze or use the inside of your elbow.

Throw used tissues in the trash.

Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not readily available, clean your hands with a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

Clean and disinfect

Clean AND disinfect frequently touched surfaces daily. This includes tables, doorknobs, light switches, countertops, handles, desks, phones, keyboards, toilets, faucets, and sinks.

If surfaces are dirty, clean them. Use detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.

Then, use a household disinfectant. Most common EPA-registered household disinfectants

will work.

Monitor Your Health

Be alert for symptoms. Watch for fever, cough, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of COVID-19.

Especially important if you are running essential errands , going into the office or workplace, and in settings where it may be difficult to keep a physical distance of 6 feet .

Take your temperature if symptoms develop.

Don’t take your temperature within 30 minutes of exercising or after taking medications that could lower your temperature, like acetaminophen.

Follow CDC guidance if symptoms develop.""

“Direct contact with people has the highest likelihood of getting infected — being close to an infected person, rather than accepting a newspaper or a FedEx guy dropping off a box,” said virologist Vincent Munster, a researcher in the virus ecology section at Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases facility in Hamilton, Mont.

In laboratory settings Munster and colleagues have demonstrated that this virus can potentially remain viable on cardboard for up to 24 hours and for up to 3 days on plastic and metal surfaces, but it will typically degrade within hours of being outside a host.

“A persistent problem in this pandemic has been lack of clear messaging from governmental leadership, and this is another unfortunate example of that trend,” said Angela L. Rasmussen, a virologist at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. “It could even have a detrimental effect on hand hygiene and encourage complacency about physical distancing or other measures.”

Rasmussen said the new CDC language will not alter her habits. “I wash my hands after handling packages and wipe down shared surfaces with household disinfectant,” she said. “In my opinion, that’s all that is necessary to reduce risk.”

CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said the revisions were the product of an internal review and “usability testing.” “Our transmission language has not changed,” Nordlund said. “Covid-19 spreads mainly through close contact from person to person.”

The previous version archived on the website does include the same statement about surfaces as the current version: “It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes. This is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads, but we are still learning more about this virus.”

For anyone who still wants to wipe down plastics and packaging with disinfectants if it makes you feel better, there is no harm in doing that. Just be sure to wash your hands afterwards to get the chemicals from off your skin and please do not wipe down food with these disinfectants.

Obtaining a good night’s sleep is a vital daily routine that many people just don’t do. Whether it is due to work, child care, a noisy environment, or something else, unfortunately few Americans make sleep a priority. Additionally, even if people try to sleep more, according to a report from the CDC, about 30% of adults in America still have trouble sleeping most nights. Additionally, 68%, or about 164 million Americans, struggle with sleep at least once a week.

Over the last 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemia sleep changes are just one of the innumerable daily activities that have been impacted by the virus. In a report from late March 2020, by the makers of Fitbit(TM), they found that their sleep tracker app was reporting major changes in sleep patterns of millions of Americans.

“People are going to bed later but getting more sleep, as well as more quality rest. For those whose quality of sleep has improved, they have been spending more time in deep and REM sleep” They also noted the importance of adequate sleep. “Your body recharges while you sleep, both repairing and building tissue and muscle. Levels of the stress hormone cortisol fall during the evening. And, getting your recommended seven to nine hours a night also boosts your immunity—something that’s more important than ever right now. “

From a report about one month later by the Smithsonian in late April 2020, researchers began to study other more ominous changes in sleep patterns. Various sleep study centers around the world reported increasingly strange and vivid dreams from those who entered their second month of stay-at-home orders .They reported:

“A growing group is experiencing insomnia, an inability to fall asleep. Both seem to be symptoms of stress, part of the shared anxiety surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. These are typical anxiety dreams and it’s acted out with vivid imagination in dreams.”

In the same report, they noted researchers in France, at the The Lyon Neuroscience Research Center, had found a 35 percent increase in dream recall and a 15 percent increase in negative dreams.

“For people not on the front lines of healthcare and emergency response, fears of the novel coronavirus are projected onto threats like zombies, bugs, and shadowy figures, which represent the pandemic metaphorically.”

Dreams tend to occur during the rapid eye movement, or REM, phase of sleep. Anxiety and low activity during the day can make it harder to get a good night’s sleep, and frequently waking up during the night can increase the likelihood that dreams are remembered the next day.

REM sleep, that is associated with dreaming, is thought to help us handle intense emotions, particularly negative emotions. Obviously, this pandemic is producing a lot of stress and anxiety. It’s imperative that we give our bodies and brains the rest and relaxation it needs. Not only to allow us to enter REM sleep and cope with stress, a good night’s sleep increases production of the vital hormones and neurotransmitters that our brain needs replenished each day.

According to Sleepfoundation.org, here are some of the ways you can cope with the profound changes of activity and stress that may be affecting your sleep during the COVID 19 pandemic:

Set Your Schedule and Routine – avoid major variation in your daily sleep time –

Same Wake-Up time every day.

Wind-Down Time -relax and get ready for bed

Bedtime – keep it consistent

Showering and getting dressed even if you aren’t leaving the house

Eating meals at the same time each day

Blocking off specific time periods for work and exercise

Avoid Naps

Reserve your Bed For Sleep

Avoid bringing a computer into bed to do work or watch a movie

Frequently changing your sheets, fluffing your pillows, and making your bed can keep your bed feeling fresh to doze off.

See the Light

Exposure to light plays a crucial role in helping our bodies regulate sleep since light-based cues have a positive effect on your circadian rhythm.

If you can, spend some time outside in natural light.

As much as possible, open windows and blinds to let light into your home during the day.

Avoid too much blue light produced by electronic devices that interfere with the body’s natural sleep-promoting processes

2,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/medicare-covid-19-telemedicine-factsheet/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-05-20,[],Medicare COVID-19 Telemedicine Factsheet,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/TelemedFactsheet_A4M_Reblog.png,"The COVID-19 outbreak has not only disrupted daily life across the globe, but the contemporary healthcare model as well, with an urgently needed shift to digital medical solutions. Federal regulations are changing continuously, insurance coverage has greatly expanded, and the use of telemedicine is growing at a tremendous rate assisted by new policies and a widespread loosening of restrictions previously impeding access to care.

As part of the battle against the novel coronavirus pandemic, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have expanded access to Medicare telehealth services on a temporary and emergency basis and lessened HIPAA enforcement effective as of March 6, 2020. These updates offer Medicare beneficiaries – many of whom are at an increased risk for serious COVID-19 illness – a safe, alternative model of care in the form of a wider range of remote services. During the COVID-19 crisis, innovative uses of telemedicine technology are driving routine care, keeping vulnerable demographics safe, and expanding access to health care.

“The benefits are part of the broader effort by CMS and the White House Task Force to ensure that all Americans – particularly those at high-risk of complications from the virus that causes the disease COVID-19 – are aware of easy-to-use, accessible benefits that can help keep them healthy while helping to contain the community spread of this virus,” a statement from the CMS on the promotion of telemedicine reads. Further information about the newly implemented guidelines for patient care and their implications on telehealth services during the COVID-19 outbreak are outlined below.

Expansion of Telehealth Services

1135 Waiver

As part of the program, the 1135 waiver was introduced to lessen prior restrictions and promote wider access to remote care. Prior to the waiver, Medicare was only able to pay for telehealth on a limited basis, for example, when a patient was receiving care in a designated rural area or when received the service in a healthcare facility. Under this waiver, the following changes have taken effect:

Office, hospital, and other telehealth visits will now be covered and reimbursed for the same amount as an in-person visit.

A wide range of providers can offer telehealth services across the nation, including nurse practitioners, psychologists, and licensed social workers.

Medicare beneficiaries are now able to receive a wider variety of services through telemedicine – such as evaluation and management visits, mental health counseling, and preventative health screenings.

The HHS Office of Inspector General is providing flexibility for healthcare providers to reduce or waive cost-sharing for telehealth visits paid by federal healthcare programs during this time.

Virtual Services

Medical professionals can provide their Medicare patients with a range of virtual services as part of the telehealth program, including Medicare telehealth visits, virtual check-ins, and e-visits. Specific requirements for each service are outlined below.

Medicare Telehealth Visits

Throughout the course of the COVID-19 outbreak, Medicare patients may use digital technology for office, hospital visits, and other services previously rendered in-person. The recent changes include:

A wider range of practitioners is now able to get payment covered for telemedicine services – including physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, midwives, anesthetists, psychologists, clinical social workers, registered dietitians, as well as nutritional professionals.

Virtual visits will now be paid at the same rate as regular, in-person visits.

Providers must use an interactive audio and video system permitting real-time communication during Medicare telehealth visits in order to be reimbursed appropriately.

New CMS guidelines remove the requirement of an established patient-provider relationship for the duration of the public health emergency, further details below.

“The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is announcing a policy of enforcement discretion for Medicare telehealth services furnished pursuant to the waiver under section 1135(b)(8) of the Act. To the extent the waiver (section 1135(g)(3)) requires that the patient have a prior established relationship with a particular practitioner, HHS will not conduct audits to ensure that such a prior relationship existed for claims submitted during this public health emergency,” the CMS statement reads.

Virtual Check-ins

In all areas of the country, Medicare beneficiaries will be able to have brief online check-ins with practitioners – or brief communication technology-based services. Policy changes related to this include:

Medicare will now pay for virtual check-ins for patients with established relationships with their physicians to prevent unnecessary travel and office visits.

Brief virtual check-ins can be conducted using a broader range of communication methods than Medicare telehealth visits; medical practitioners may bill for virtual check-in services provided via several telecommunication technologies – including telephone, audio/video, secure text messaging, email, and patient portals.

Services cannot be related to a medical visit within the previous 7 days or lead to a medical visit within the following 24 hours, or the soonest available appointment.

Patients must verbally consent to receive virtual check-in services.

Patients can submit video/images using store and forward methods to be interpreted by physicians within 24 business hours.

E-Visits

As part of the updated guidelines, established Medicare patients in all types of locations can have non-face-to-face patient-initiated communications with their providers using online patient portals. These services can only be rendered in accordance with the following guidelines:

E-visit services can only be reported to Medicare if the billing practice has an established relationship with the patient.

E-visits must be initiated by the patient although practices may educate patients on the availability of these services prior to their initiation.

Communications can occur over a 7-day period and only after the patient provides verbal consent to receive telehealth services.

These services may be billed using CPT codes 99421-99423 and HCPCS codes G2061.

More information on relevant billing codes for e-visits and other virtual care services can be found on the CMS’ website.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Updates

In addition to the amendments above, the HHS Office for Civil Rights will lessen restrictions and waive penalties in association with HIPAA compliance for health care providers that serve patients in good faith through virtual communication technologies during the COVID-19 outbreak. More information on the latest HIPAA updates can be accessed here.

Although Medicare already offers flexibility to states that wish to implement telehealth services, the most recent developments signal a major step forward in the direction of telemedicine, despite the temporary nature of federal guidelines. With the help of changes in regulations and the strategic expansion of telehealth, patients can now reach providers easily via a range of telecommunication options from the comfort and safety of their homes, while medical professionals can readily provide care without reimbursement concerns. As the COVID-19 public health emergency continues to evolve rapidly, regulations and guidelines may change; clinicians are encouraged to stay up-to-date on the latest medical guidance.",Low,,USA,0
3,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/new-data-suggest-covid-19-may-not-be-deadly-thought/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-05-18,[],New Data Suggest COVID-19 May Not Be As Deadly As Thought,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_57898544.jpeg,"With more antibody testing being done a recent study has found that there may be as many as 50-85% as many infections as there are known cases, based on their findings, this suggests that there could actually be a lower fatality rate and COVID-19 may not be as deadly as we once thought. This is not to say that it is not something to be concerned about, especially for those with pre-existing conditions, just that the fatality rates may be lower.

The shut down and lock downs of recent months have all been based on the premise that COVID-19 would kill more than 2 million Americans without taking some serious actions to slow down the spread of the virus, as we didn’t have any immunity to this novel disease. The model used at that time assumed the case fatality rates being at 1-3%, and at the time W.H.O estimated a case fatality rate of 3.4%.

Some experts are questioning these assumptions, arguing that without widespread accurate testing the known cases are likely to be only a very small portion of the true number of infections given the ease of spread, and thus high case fatality rate could be well off the mark by orders of magnitude. The truth is that we don’t know what portion of infections have gone undetected and probably since cleared in the vast majority of the population due to lack of testing, the highly restrictive qualifications to get tested, and the potentially large incidence of mild illness or asymptomatic infection to this highly contagious virus running amok since January at an unknown rate.

As the weeks pass more data is being released supporting these views such as a recent preliminary study from researchers at Stanford which conducted a seroprevalence study of Santa Clara County, California on April 3-4, 2020 studying a representative sampling of 3,300 residents to test for the presence of antibodies in their blood to show if they had previously been infected with COVID-19.

This study revealed that the Bay Area infections based on the antibody testing were 85 times higher than what had been reported, which is largely due to the lack of testing and asymptomatic carriers allowing the virus to spread unknown. The researchers suggest that their data may help to better estimate the true fatality rate of this virus; the population prevalence of COVID-19 in Santa Clara among the 3,300 adults and children ranged from 2.49% to 4.16%.

“The most important implication of these findings is that the number of infections is much greater than the reported number of cases,” the researchers wrote, in a yet-to-be peer-reviewed study. “Our data imply that, by April 1 (three days prior to the end of our survey) between 48,000 and 81,000 people had been infected in Santa Clara County. The reported number of confirmed positive cases in the county on April 1 was 956, 50-85-fold lower than the number of infections predicted by this study.”

“Many estimates of fatality rate use a ratio of deaths to lagged cases (because of duration from case confirmation to death), with an infections-to-cases ratio in the 1-5 fold range as an estimate of under-ascertainment,” the researchers wrote. “Our study suggests that adjustments for under-ascertainment may need to be much higher.”

Detecting previously unreported cases of COVID-19 infections could lead to a better estimation of the fatality rate. This study was not without limitations, but after adjustments were made to take these into account the researchers suggest these results could be applied to other areas.

“While our study was limited to Santa Clara County, it demonstrates the feasibility of seroprevalence surveys of population samples now, and in the future, to inform our understanding of this pandemic’s progression, project estimates of community vulnerability, and monitor infection fatality rates in different populations over time,” the researchers said. “It is also an important tool for reducing uncertainty about the state of the epidemic, which may have important public benefits.”

“This probably aligns with what overall national exposure may be, on order of about 5 percent once we do wide serology,” tweeted Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, agreeing that these findings likely align with what the overall national exposure may look like. “Santa Clara was a hot spot and I would have expected exposure to be higher. Overall we’re probably diagnosing 1 in 10 to 1 in 20 infections.”

Gottlieb also suggests that other hot zones such as New York that have reported over 223,000 cases of infection have data “to suggest the infection rate may be much higher.”

“We’re also likely to find higher rates of infection among certain jobs,” he tweeted. “But the data so far suggest that nationally, total exposure is still low.”

As several states begin to cautiously reopen there has been an increased push for antibody testing which, if accurate, may be able to reveal who already had the virus who may not have been tested for it. Antibody testing can be conducted via blood but can also be done using saliva looking to detect IgM and IgG antibodies that can take up to 14 days to develop.

“Those who test positive for immunity, in theory, are safe to return to work but it is to be very cautioned against doing so considering medical professionals are still learning about this virus,” said Dr. Robert Segal. “The human race has not developed an immunity to this virus, there is a possibility that re-infections could occur. We cannot be certain of that at this time.”

Accuracy of these rushed to market tests have however been called into question. As with any test accuracy is always a concern, and many of these rushed serology tests have yet to be approved by the FDA.

John Brownstein an epidemiologist at Boston Children’s Hospital said that there is growing recognition in the field that the numbers of those infected are far greater than the official numbers, and ultimately he says about this study that, “It adds to growing body of work that suggests a huge amount of cases that went undetected.”",Low,,USA,0

Lipoprotein(a) is a still largely unknown LDL-cholesterol like molecule. It is, however, the most frequent inherited risk factor for heart attack, stroke, and calcific aortic valve disease. Lipoprotein(a), also known as Lp(a), is inherited in 20-30% of populations tested suggesting that it is elevated in over 1.5 billion people worldwide. Reports on Lp(a) are available in the research and lay press and a book has been published on the topic this year.

A unique feature of Lp(a) is that, in addition to its pro-atherosclerotic and pro-inflammatory potential, it also promotes blood clotting. Studies have evaluated if persons who inherit Lp(a) are at more risk of blood clots in the legs, lungs and other sites. An increased frequency of Lp(a) in persons suffering these serious conditions has been reported. An elevated level of Lp(a) in stroke patients increased the risk 12 fold for a deep venous thrombosis in one study.

COVID-19 and Hypercoagulability

An unexpected aspect of patient care during the current pandemic with COVID-19 infections is the frequent finding of aggressive blood clotting in arterial and venous circulations. A unique coagulopathy has been identified and recently reviewed. Some COVID-19 patients become seriously ill and die due to rampant clotting in vital organs. The gripping fight for survival by Broadway star Nick Cordero, and his need to have a leg amputated apparently due in part to vascular compromise and clotting, has captured many hearts and minds in the media.

Lipoprotein(a) and COVID-19

To date, there are no published reports examining whether levels of Lp(a) are elevated in patients fighting COVID-19 who experience clotting complications. However, two organizations have provided comments on the possibility that this possible connection should be considered. The FH Foundation has added a section on their website indicating that many patients with Familial Hyperlipidemia (FH) also have an elevated Lp(a) and may be at risk for clotting disorders if infected. In addition, the Lipoprotein(a) Foundation has added comments on their website. This included a letter by S. Tsimikas, MD, of the University of California San Diego and noted researcher on Lp(a). He indicates in the letter that an inflammatory mediator, IL-6, is increased in the cytokine storm that can develop during a COVID-19 infection. IL-6 can also increase levels of Lp(a) raising the possibility that elevated and rising levels of Lp(a) could lead to cardiovascular complications and a poorer prognosis.

What to Do?

If you know you have an elevated level of Lp(a), it would seem prudent to take even greater precautions with hand washing, physical distancing, masks, and overall healthy lifestyles including nutrient rich diets. If you do not know if you have an elevated level, it would be wise to have yours checked on a simple blood test run by every major laboratory. There is even a ICD-10 code for elevated Lp(a) which is E78.41. If you have cardiovascular disease, taking precautions as to exposure and lifestyle are recommended along with maintaining your prescription medications. It is unknown if added a low dose adult aspirin (81 mg) in the absence of an allergy, or using natural anticoagulants like garlic and nattokinase, are of any protection",Low,,USA,0

According to this report children, teens, and young adults are at greater risk than what was previously thought according to a recent study.

""The idea that COVID-19 is sparing of young people is just false,"" said study coauthor Lawrence C. Kleinman, professor and vice chair for academic development and chief of the Department of Pediatrics' Division of Population Health, Quality and Implementation Science at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. ""While children are more likely to get very sick if they have other chronic conditions, including obesity, it is important to note that children without chronic illness are also at risk. Parents need to continue to take the virus seriously.""

A study published in JAMA Pediatrics is the first to describe the characteristics of seriously ill COVID-19 pediatric patients within North America, it followed 48 young children and young adults between the ages of being newborn to 21 years of age who were admitted to pediatric ICUs for COVID-19 in Canada and America during March and April 2020. Over 80% of these patients had underlying conditions such as obesity, diabetes, immune suppression, seizures, or chronic lung disease, of those 40% depended on technological support due to developmental delays or genetic anomalies.

Over 20% of these young patients experienced failure of 2 or more organs systems due to COVID-19, and nearly 40% required either a breathing tube or ventilator. Nearly 33% of the children were still hospitalized due to COVID-19 at the end of the follow up period, with 3 still requiring ventilator support and 1 on life support; and 2 of the children admitted during the 3 week study period lost their battle with this disease.

""This study provides a baseline understanding of the early disease burden of COVID-19 in pediatric patients,"" said Hariprem Rajasekhar, a pediatric intensivist involved in conducting the study at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School's Department of Pediatrics. ""The findings confirm that this emerging disease was already widespread in March and that it is not universally benign among children.""

The hospital outcomes for children in this study was 4.2% mortality rate for PICU patients with a lower rate for incidences of respiratory failure, compared to a reported 62% among adults admitted to ICUs. Physicians in the New York Metropolitan area are reporting seeing what appears to be a new COVID-19 related syndrome in children.

Dr. Thomas Cureton, a renowned exercise scientist and researcher, once noted: “The human body is the only machine that breaks down when not used.” During the current COVID-19 pandemic, remaining fit and active has become a major challenge for many. Gyms are closed nationwide. Sports and most leisure activities are also banned, especially if more than one individual is involved. Even professional athletes find themselves sitting it out on the sidelines.

Exercise has countless health benefits, but they do not last long if you stop exercising. In a matter of weeks, you can lose many of the benefits that you worked so hard to obtain. Cardiovascular conditioning, muscle strength, and flexibility all start to decline when you stop moving and hit the couch. This happens more rapidly in middle-aged and older individuals. So how can you maintain or improve your fitness level during this challenging time?

We live in a time when large segments of the population are either very active and fit, or they are sedentary. So how, during this pandemic, can fit people stay fit? And how can sedentary people get more active?

If you are fit and active, you must find creative ways to remain so. It may involve trying new things. For cardiovascular fitness, activities like running, cycling, and taking brisk walks are fine, as long as you maintain social distancing. Home strength workouts can be done with calisthenics, free weights, and exercise bands to maintain muscular strength. A stability ball can be used to improve core strength and endurance. Stretching can be done easily and should be done daily. Taking up yoga will enhance flexibility and also help with stress management. Many gyms and personal trainers are offering virtual workouts, and there are ample online exercise programs and fitness books that provide valuable guidance and routines.

If you have been sedentary, this downtime may be a great opportunity to get more active and improve your health. According to the Surgeon General’s Report on Physical Activity and Health, being sedentary is as dangerous as smoking a pack of cigarettes per day. So get off the couch, take a walk, do some yard work or gardening. If you have medical issues, always check with your physician to see if you can safely start to exercise.

For both groups—active and sedentary—there are things you can do to lessen the risk of orthopaedic or musculoskeletal issues with exercise. With any new activity, start slowly and follow the “10% rule.” That is, do not increase the intensity or duration of the activity more than 10% per week. This includes the distance you walk or the amount of weight you lift. Always warm up and stretch before activity. Wear appropriate footwear and use proper protective equipment when applicable. Stay well hydrated.

As COVID-related restrictions are lifted, follow CDC guidelines on resuming your favorite activity or sport. The American Council on Exercise (ACE) offers excellent information on staying active during the pandemic. Also, organizations like the United States Tennis Association (USTA) and the United States Golf Association (USGA) offer more sport-specific guidelines in terms of returning to play during COVID-19.

One thing is for certain, during normal times or a pandemic, being sedentary is not an option. Find ways to safely keep moving and avoid the body break-down that Dr. Cureton warned about.",Low,,USA,0

According to the recent research nearly everyone who becomes infected with this virus and goes on to recover will develop antibodies to it; 95% of the 285 patients developed both types of immune cells that fight this virus.

Globally antibody testing is being geared up in an attempt to see who has already had the virus and was able to develop some potential form of natural protection against reinfection from COVID-19. However, many questions remain around these antibodies such as whether everyone will develop them, what level is necessary to confer protection, and just how long the protection if any will last.

This study was designed to help answer one of those question and it “brings much-needed clarity, along with renewed enthusiasm, to efforts to develop and implement widescale antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2,” wrote Dr Francis Collins on the National Institutes of Health's (NIH) Director's blog.

By this point just about everyone has heard about antibodies and knows that they are immune cells that the body develops in a unique response to a given pathogen, and if you have never had exposure to a virus or bacterium you will not develop antibodies to it. In response to most infections the body will start producing these specialized cells that will recognize and target an infection should it occur again, often it will neutralize the pathogen entirely.

Coronaviruses are much like those that cause the common cold, from what is known about other coronaviruses scientists are guessing that humans will develop antibodies against this novel version. Up until recently there was no knowing for sure until they were able to study patients.

In this study the blood of 258 patients was monitored for signs of immune cells; humans produce two types of antibodies Igm and IgG. The first is produced early after infection and these IgM antibodies provide a short burst of protection before fading away; 40% of the patients had produced IgM antibodies within the first week of infection, and after two weeks of observation 95% had developed detectable levels of IgM and were producing IgG antibodies that take longer to develop but have more potential for long term protection.

In a follow up study blood was collected from another 69 patients, and within 20 days all but two patients produced antibodies; those two patients were a related mother and daughter.

To determine how much protection these antibodies carry and for how long they confer immunity scientists will need to continue to study patients and follow them, perhaps even doing challenge experiments to expose them to the virus again to see if their antibodies will protect them from reinfections.

However, until enough time has passed for such studies to be completed these studies are indeed an encouraging sign that the human body is able to learn and develop defenses against COVID-19 after exposure. If this turns out to be the case humanity may be able to develop some form of herd immunity against COVID-19 that would help to keep possible future cases of this virus from reaching epidemic levels as are currently being experienced on a global scale.

“There’s still a way to go with both virus and antibody testing for COVID-19,” wrote Dr Collins. “But as this study and others begin to piece together the complex puzzle of antibody-mediated immunity, it will be possible to learn more about the human body’s response to SARS-CoV-2 and home in on our goal of achieving safe, effective, and sustained protection against this devastating disease.”",Low,,USA,0

Hong Kong scientists have completed a clinical study in which administering this cocktail of antiviral medications to patients with mild coronavirus symptoms ""may rapidly suppress the amount of virus in a patient's body.""

""Early triple antiviral therapy was safe and superior to lopinavir–ritonavir alone in alleviating symptoms and shortening the duration of viral shedding and hospital stay in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19,"" the study authors wrote, adding that ""future clinical study of a double antiviral therapy with interferon beta-1b as a backbone is warranted"" for a complete overview.

As published in the Lancet this 127 patient open label study had 86 patients randomly assigned to the experimental cocktail treatment group and 41 to the control group who only received the HIV therapy drug lopinavir-ritonavir; age, gender, and baseline demographics in each group were similar with fever and a dry cough being among the most common symptoms. After only seven days of being administered the experiments cocktail treatment the patients tested negative for COVID-19 according to the researchers.

""For the primary endpoint of time from start of study treatment to negative nasopharyngeal swab, the combination group had a significantly shorter median time (7 days) than the control group (12 days),"" the study authors noted. ""For the virological outcome, the combination treatment was associated with significantly shorter time to negative viral load in all specimens when assessed individually (nasopharyngeal swab, posterior oropharyngeal saliva, throat swab, and stool samples) as well as in all specimens combined. All urine samples tested negative for viral load.""

Previously established side effects of the medications were being closely monitored, however the drugs have a long standing track record for safety according to medical officials, and on average patients in the cocktail group felt better after 4 days.

""Despite the concern of major side effects arising from a combination of three drugs, no significant differences in incidence of adverse events between treatment groups were reported in our cohort of 127 patients,"" the study authors wrote.

""No haemolysis occurred from the short duration of low dose ribavirin. We did not use triple combination for patients who started treatment 7 days or more after symptom onset because of the concerns about the proinflammatory side effects of interferon beta-1b – despite that at most, three doses were used for each patient,"" they added, noting that ""liver dysfunction was observed in about 14% of these patients and it was mild and self-limiting, except in one patient in the control group, in whom the biochemical hepatitis warranted the discontinuation of lopinavir–ritonavir treatment.""

This study was independently reviewed by experts who concurred that these findings were positive, but suggest that larger clinical trials are required for greater certainty of the cocktail’s effectiveness and safety. Other diseases have a record of being treated successfully with a cocktail of drugs, the experts believe that it may also be the case for COVID-19, results are promising and warrant adding interferon beta to the list of evidence based treatments for the coronavirus.",Low,,USA,0
9,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/vitamin-d-levels-appear-have-role-covid-19-mortality/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-05-11,[],Vitamin D Levels Appear To Have A Role In COVID-19 Mortality,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_72180692.jpeg,"It may be a good idea to spend some time in the sun, especially for those with preexisting conditions and those worried about COVID-19, as recent research suggests that patients with severe vitamin D deficiency are twice as likely to experience major complications.

Patient data was analyzed from 10 countries which revealed a correlation between low levels of vitamin D and hyperactive immune systems; vitamin D strengthens innate immunity and prevents overactive immune responses and these findings may help to explain several mysteries including why children are unlikely to die from this disease.

The research team led by Northwestern University conducted a statistical analysis of data from clinics and hospitals across America, Spain, Switzerland, France, Germany, Iran, Italy, South Korea, China, and the UK; patients residing in countries with high COVID-19 mortality rates were noted to have had lower levels of vitamin D compared to those in countries that were not as severely affected.

""While I think it is important for people to know that vitamin D deficiency might play a role in mortality, we don't need to push vitamin D on everybody,"" said Northwestern's Vadim Backman, who led the research. ""This needs further study, and I hope our work will stimulate interest in this area. The data also may illuminate the mechanism of mortality, which, if proven, could lead to new therapeutic targets.""

Inspired to examine the unexplained differences in COVID-19 mortality rates from country to country with some suggesting it was due to age distributions, testing rates, different strains of the virus, or differences in healthcare the team remained skeptical of those hypotheses and looked for a common denominator.

""None of these factors appears to play a significant role,"" Backman said. ""The healthcare system in northern Italy is one of the best in the world. Differences in mortality exist even if one looks across the same age group. And, while the restrictions on testing do indeed vary, the disparities in mortality still exist even when we looked at countries or populations for which similar testing rates apply.” ""Instead, we saw a significant correlation with vitamin D deficiency.”

Analyzing publicly available patient data from the various countries around the globe allowed the team to discover the strong correlation between vitamin D levels and the cytokine storm caused by the overactive immune system, as well as a correlation between vitamin D deficiency and the increased mortality rate.

""Cytokine storm can severely damage lungs and lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death in patients,"" said first author Ali Daneshkhah. ""This is what seems to kill a majority of COVID-19 patients, not the destruction of the lungs by the virus itself. It is the complications from the misdirected fire from the immune system.""

This is where vitamin D is believed to play a key role, as not only does it boost the innate immune systems, it also prevents the immune system from becoming dangerously over active; meaning that maintaining healthy levels of vitamin D could protect patients from severe complications which may include death from COVID-19.

""Our analysis shows that it might be as high as cutting the mortality rate in half,"" Backman said. ""It will not prevent a patient from contracting the virus, but it may reduce complications and prevent death in those who are infected.""

This correlation may explain why childrens are less likely to die from this disease, as they don’t have a fully developed acquired immune system which is the immune system’s second line of defense and is more likely to overreact. ""Children primarily rely on their innate immune system,"" Backman said. ""This may explain why their mortality rate is lower.""

The researchers caution that this does not mean that everyone needs to start hoarding vitamin D supplements, especially those without a known deficiency. All one needs to do to boost vitamin D levels is to spend about 10 to 30 minutes a day in direct sunlight a few times per week, which is free. Also it is important not to take excessive doses of vitamin D supplements which could have some negative side effects. Backman suggests that more research is required to determine the protective effects of vitamin D against COVID-19.

""It is hard to say which dose is most beneficial for COVID-19,"" Backman said. ""However, it is clear that vitamin D deficiency is harmful, and it can be easily addressed with appropriate supplementation. This might be another key to helping protect vulnerable populations, such as African-American and elderly patients, who have a prevalence of vitamin D deficiency.""",Low,,USA,0

Many are beginning to worry that the COVID-19 virus will, like many others, mutate or develop a way to get around the antibodies that are under development that target the virus’s spike protein which facilitates the infection of healthy cells.

To address this concern Sorrento Therapeutics is working on developing an antibody cocktail that will bind to three different epitopes rather than targeting just one point on the spike protein as most of the current work elsewhere is doing. The company has also teamed up with Mount Sinai Health System in New York to help further the development of the cocktail treatment.

“If one epitope mutates and one of the antibodies does not do its job anymore, the other two can do the job,” Henry Ji, Ph.D., CEO of Sorrento, told FierceBiotechResearch. “They are synergistic.”

According to Ji, the cocktail therapy is being called COVI-SHIELD, and it started with a diagnostic developed at Sinai which was used to screen 15,000 people believed to have recovered from the disease. Samples from these patients are being used to identify a few dozen antibodies that stand the best odds of being able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2.

Sorrento will also be working with scientists at the University of Texas Medical Branch who will then be testing the antibodies against the live virus to investigate how to achieve total inhibition of viral infection. Once the top performers are identified the company will present the selections to Sinai to further analyze the selections. Once the company moves into phase 1 trials that are hoped to begin in the third quarter, Sinai may also serve as the clinical testing site for COVI-SHIELD.

Sorrento has entered the field to join the companies working to develop antibodies to neutralize COVID-19 along with others such as Eli Lilly who recently paid $10 million to Junshi Biosciences for the right to co-develop and market a human monoclonal antibody against the disease. However, Regeneron has identified two neutralizing antibodies and is considered to be the front runner in the race with plans to move their cocktail to testing as early as June 2020.

Neutralizing antibodies does not come without risks of the possibility of backfiring in the antibody dependent enhancement process, whereby the virus can use the antibodies to bolster the infection. Regeneron suggests to have addressed this concern expressing confidence that their experimental cocktail can avoid ADE by targeting “uber stealth constant regions” of the virus.

Antibodies are being engineered by Sorrento to not bind to the receptor on immune cells that are believed to cause ADE; antibodies will also be selected that have different mechanisms for neutralizing the virus to reduce the chance of patients becoming resistant to treatment, according to Robert Allen who is the vice president of antiviral and oncolytic immunotherapy development for Sorrento.

“Some of them are going to neutralize through direct blocking between spike and ACE2,” the receptor that helps the virus infect human cells, Allen said. “Others are going to neutralize through a non-blocking mechanism. We’re able to create a higher barrier to resistance that way.”

The company is setting out on this venture after avoiding a takeover bid from an equity firm in January 2020, disclosing it received a buyout bid of $7 a share which was twice the trading price at the time.

Despite the increasing amount of competition rushing to develop and market against COVID-19, Sorrento and its academic collaborators are confident they will be able to work quickly to discover an effective cocktail to utilize against the disease. The company is aware of all the rivals and says there is still much work to do before any treatment will be ready for clinical testing.

“The Mount Sinai collaboration is very important for us, because they screened 15,000 samples and picked the highest-protected people,” Ji said. “We expect to be able to isolate very potent antibodies. We don’t know which of these antibodies will be useful. Maybe some of them, maybe none,” he said. “Whoever has the best antibody wins.”",Low,,USA,0

In South Korea there have been over 10,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 245 deaths, that is a 2.3% fatality rate which is lower than the 3.4% averaged as stated by W.H.O. In South Korea a total of 277 patients were reported to have fallen ill for a second time, as with China and Japan.

The apparent reinfections prompted concerns over the virus mutating at a rate so quickly that people would not be able to build immunity against it. The following genetic analyses of the virus did not yield any substantial changes in the virus that would effectively disguise it from the immune system.

As a result of these reports W.H.O has warned against using “immunity passports” as a way of allowing people to return to work simply because they have antibodies for the virus in approaches for countries to begin to lift restrictions and lock downs in a targeted manner to resume economic activity. Such passports would be issued to those who have overcome COVI-19 infections and tested positive for antibodies for the virus based on the assumption of them being immune, but they rely on the accuracy of the testing.

In an update to this guidance WHO warned that there was ""no evidence that people who have recovered from COVID-19 and have antibodies are protected from a second infection"". It was also not expected that the PCR testing used to check for blood antigens for the actual particles of the virus itself would have issues.

The South Korean CDC has found that the PCR test results for the suspected relapsed patients were false positives, warning that the tests were not able to distinguish between live traces of the virus and the harmless dead samples that remain after the patient has recovered.

W.H.O is warning that immunity certification will depend upon the accuracy and reliability of the testing that is being rapidly developed, which under normal circumstances take years of trials to determine.

""People who assume that they are immune to a second infection because they have received a positive test result may ignore public health advice,"" the WHO warned. ""The use of such certificates may therefore increase the risks of continued transmission,"" its guidance added at the time, although this guidance is currently being kept under review.

Unlike other viruses like HIV and chickenpox that can break into the nucleus of human cells to stay latent for years before reactivating, COVID-19 stays outside of the host’s cell nucleus according to the South Korean CDC.

""This means it does not cause chronic infection or recurrence,"" explained Dr Oh Myoung-dong, the head of the CDC committee, meaning it is unlikely for patients to relapse in this fashion.

However, if the virus mutates further it could be possible that COVID-19 could infect people who had previously overcome it in the future, in a manner similar to that of the flu.",Low,,USA,0

""There is no widespread undetected community transmission in New Zealand. We have won that battle,"" Prime Minister Ardern said. ""But we must remain vigilant if we are to keep it that way.""

The normally very busy and active island is now basically barren in comparison since the outbreak, deserted highways are just one manifestation of their resolute response to COVID-19; under their stringent lock down orders lights are dark and patios empty at every pub, cafe, and business, while there is yellow police tape sealing off parks and playgrounds with swings and equipment being tied up and out of reach to ward off temptation, as well as trails have barriers with closed signs at their entrances.

The emptiness across this beautiful island shows that the residents here are following orders and there is not much risk of transgression other than an occasional jogger or a person out for a brief stroll to get some air. Everything is closed except a few paved paths to and from towns to get essential supplies.

Close to 4 million visitors travel to New Zealand to experience its picturesque splendor and wilderness landscape, that is approximately 80% of the resident population, but this outbreak has forced the country to close all of the sought after landscapes and its borders.

If there is a shiny spot amid the global responses to this outbreak, New Zealand just might be it. While other governments have been more than a little indecisive wavering between different opinions and actions on the best response allowing the ensuing cases of infection to soar, New Zealand has set an uncompromising science driven example.

The country banned travel from China on February 3rd and since then their trajectory of new cases looked out of control until mid March when their austerity measures seemingly have been able to bring the spread of COVID-19 to heel on the island nation.

On March 15 the country began mandatory quarantines on all visitors, the strictest policy at the time, and just 10 days later New Zealand instituted a complete countrywide lock down which included a moratorium on the domestic level. The level 4 restrictions meant that hospitals, pharmacies, petrol stations and grocery stores were the only commerce allowed to be open, vehicle travel was restricted, and social interaction was limited to within households.

The Prime Minister of New Zealand made clear, concise statements about the situation to the nation, and was bolstered by a team of scientists and health professionals to help stop any confusion or panic about the sudden austerity, while delivering and supporting the same message. She also announced a few days after the lock down that the country rather than just slowing the transmission of the virus had set a course to eradicate the virus by cutting off the arrival of new cases and choking out any existing ones with these restrictions.

“We must fight by going hard and going early,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a statement to the nation on March 14. “We have the opportunity to do something no other country has achieved: elimination of the virus. But it will continue to need a team of 5 million behind it.”

“The virus doesn’t have superpowers. Once transmission is stopped, it’s gone,” said Petousis-Harris, a vaccine expert at the University of Auckland, who suggests that the country had managed to avoid the confusion and half-measures that have hampered the response in many other countries. “New Zealand got everything right,” she said. “Decisive action, with strong leadership and very clear communications to everybody.”

Looking at New Zealand from the outside perspective it is rather different than the indecisiveness, confusion, and whinging being seen in America, in New Zealand the entire country simply got on board with the idea as it was clearly and concisely explained to them. In this country right from day one of their lock down the streets and highways were empty, stores were closed and everyone stayed home rather than complaining like entitled children having a temper tantrum.

Since their measures were put into place, they appear to be working as their daily infection rate in this island nation of 4.9 million people has been decreasing steadily from the maximum of 146 in March to just a few cases by mid April; in all New Zealand has reported a high of 1,476 cases with 19 deaths, and on April 26th, the country experienced no new COVID-19 cases and no community transmission for the first time in 6 weeks, but 7 new cases appeared on April 30, 2020.

Even with the 7 new cases the low numbers gave the government the confidence to ease up on the country’s social distancing restrictions to lower them to Level 3 at the end of April, and Ardern pronounced that the virus had been eliminated, she later clarified that “elimination doesn’t mean zero cases... we will have to keep stamping COVID out....” Downgrading to level 3 means that most but not all businesses are being allowed to reopen provided they follow safety measures, but all that require face to face contact must remain closed until level 2 is reached.

""Your business must be contactless. Your customers can pay online, over the phone or in a contactless way,"" she said. ""Delivery or pickup must also be contactless.""

Even though New Zealand is sounding fairly confident about eliminating this virus, the success is not guaranteed. For instance other countries such as Singapore that also appeared to have the virus under control have now been struggling with a second wave of infections, and in China which also appeared to stop the spread completely are now contending with a second wave as well.

If New Zealand has managed to contain this virus outbreak, the country will still face a long and hard road, as once they are virus free they will need to maintain the total halt on all arrivals from outside of the country or risk the chance of reinfection until the entire world has managed to snuff out the virus as well. For a country like New Zealand that is largely reliant on tourism in terms of foreign exchange earnings that accounts for 10% of the GDP and nearly 15% of their workforce that is a tough prospect. For the Kiwi economy this puts hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake, and it is forecasted that the country will be among the hardest hit nations, which may not recover until at least 2024.

Australia has also been experiencing a decline in their new cases since their peak a month ago, according to their home affairs minister Peter Dutton, New Zealand and Australia are at a comparable stage in their fight against COVID-19.

Recent surveys indicate that 87% of the New Zealand population support the way that their government is handling this crisis, and it may have been easier for citizens to fall in to tow the line in this country because in general the vast majority trusts their leaders. In New Zealand it is reported that the streets remain clean and quiet, public services are functioning, stores are well stocked, and the risk of contracting COVID-19 appears to be remote and diminishing with each passing day thanks to clear and concise leadership and the citizens cooperating by following guidelines to do their part in battling the outbreak.",Low,,USA,0
13,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/physicians-recession-guide-how-protect-your-practice-during-covid-19/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-05-04,[],Physician’s Recession Guide: How to Protect Your Practice During COVID-19,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/RecessionGuide_A4M_Reblog.png,"Medical practices managing patients during the COVID-19 pandemic are being confronted with new and unique operational challenges as many have turned to telemedicine, bringing their services online to continue patient care. Other providers may find it increasingly difficult to continue conducting business in light of wide-scale cancellations of elective procedures and recommendations against in-person office appointments. Unprecedented economic fallout related to the virus outbreak is proving to be another significant concern facing the healthcare system.

In response to this complex issue faced by clinicians across the country, the American Medical Association has compiled a set of recommendations and guidelines on handling the financial and operational repercussions of the outbreak for practice owners and office administrators.

To better adapt practices to current demands and protect them from adverse financial impact at this time, medical professionals should consider the following important variables and strategic responses:

Insurance Coverage

A critical first step to securing the medical practice is to ensure it is protected against COVID-19 related liabilities under business insurance policies. Whether the protection is part of insurance policies will determine the associated risks and help providers make vital business and operational decisions. Experts urge practices to contact their insurance brokers to obtain a complete copy of all insurance policies, understand government emergency orders and decrees, as well as to track losses and expenses incurred during this time for future claims.

Further, practitioners are urged to consult legal counsel for explanations of how they can exercise existing policies and how government orders impact business operations in their state. “You may need to notify professional liability carriers in the event practice providers are called upon to assist with emergency care, including outside of their normal clinical service arrangements,” the AMA adds in its latest guidelines.

In addition, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has published a declaration of liability protection against certain medical countermeasures related to COVID-19 which can be accessed here.

Financial Obligations and Contingency Planning

To minimize potential economic risk, practices are encouraged to revise financial plans at this time and ensure their ongoing liquidity; this will hopefully protect those businesses suffering from a loss of clinical revenue due to cancelled procedures, decreasing outpatient visits, and partial or whole closures. It is recommended practices develop a financial contingency plan based on minimum cash flows needed to remain in operation, review existing loan documents and financial covenants, and determine if slowdown of business could trigger a default situation.

Practices should prioritize managing cash to the best extent possible and consider delaying payments of discretionary bonuses as well as other such payments. They may also choose to consider requesting forbearance, forgiveness, or a standstill from lenders and other creditors. Proactive communication with these third-parties can help ensure accommodations are granted during revenue disruptions.

Additionally, clinicians are urged to monitor resources as they become available concerning economic relief packages for business and workers affected by the outbreak; the U.S. Small Business Administration has already begun introducing low-interest loans while other organizations – such as United Way – have created COVID-19 relief funds to provide additional funding.

Current and Future Supply Needs

In light of global shortages of essential medical supplies, such as personal protective equipment and respirators, practices are encouraged to evaluate their current and future supply needs. While a reduction in in-person office visits may decrease the number of interactions requiring the use of such equipment, practices should determine how much cash flow can be devoted to stocking up on essential supplies for the forthcoming months.

“While your business may be interrupted, you may also be called upon to triage patients outside of your normal workflow, so contact your supply vendors and, if necessary, your state and local health authorities to ensure that you are in the queue to receive necessary supplies,” the AMA recommends.

Continuing Business Operations

A growing number of “shelter in place” orders and their extensions may impact the ability of medical practices to continue business operations. However, many of these orders designate healthcare services as essential businesses but publicly available guidance may remain unclear. Practitioners are urged to consult with local counsel to determine the implications of executive orders and how to apply them to their practice.

To further assist clinicians, the AMA provides two non-jurisdiction specific template letters that can be modified to suit the needs of each practice in COVID-19 related circumstances. These templates aim to function as a resource for providers who may encounter questions from authorities or resistance from employees who may not report to work due to “shelter in place” orders.

Regular Communication with Patients

Whether a practice is operating normally or offering digital medical services, it is currently essential to maintain regular communication with patients – in particular, those who may be at-risk of adverse health outcomes as a result of the disruption in healthcare. Reports reveal a silent sub-epidemic caused by COVID-19, that of an increasing number of patients forgoing needed medical care out of fear of contracting the virus in a hospital or medical facility. Patients need to be made aware of the COVID-19 prevention and safety protocols enforced at a practice or other healthcare center and be encouraged to stay in contact with their physicians via telehealth and to come in for in-person care when needed.

Administrative Resources

Despite interruptions in operations, many practices will still operate remotely. To assist healthcare providers in meeting immediate care needs while working from home, office administrators are encouraged to compile essential resources outlining best telemedicine practices. This includes putting in place methods of maintaining documentation protocols to obtain payments, including processes for collection of accounts, claims submissions, and other activities. More information regarding medical codes and scenario planning has been made available as part of the AMA’s resource hub.

Workflow and Digital Health Tools

To protect staff members, conserve valuable equipment and supplies, and reduce the safety and liability risk to your practice, providers are urged to follow the latest guidance issued by governmental agencies when reviewing scheduled visits and choosing which appointments to postpone, cancel, or proceed with as usual.

Digital tools can assist providers by allowing them to continue conducting business remotely via telehealth services and remote patient monitoring. Following the CMS’ telemedicine toolkit can help physicians and practices utilize these technologies during the COVID-19 outbreak and provide insight into emerging policy changes and practice flexibilities.

Employee Management

Keeping employees updated and informed is essential to managing concerns about health and safety. Practices are encouraged to institute interim guidelines that aim to educate their employees, including outlining circumstances under which they should not report to work, contact information for relevant resources, and specify leave policies related to COVID-19.

Depending on revenue and cash flow challenges, practices may need to furlough or terminate non-essential employees. In these cases, practices should seek legal counsel to understand their obligations, requirements regarding communication of employment status, and identify workflow changes which may be necessary at this time.

While all practices may not be able to sustain each of their employees, healthcare staff is urgently needed at medical facilities across the nation – as such, administrators should identify external opportunities for their furloughed or terminated staff members when possible.

The CDC has issued interim guidance to assist business and employers in navigating the evolving situation, while the U.S. Department of Labor also released resources pertaining to employee furloughs and unemployment benefits.

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted unprecedented policy and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system nationwide; it is essential for medical professionals to stay current on the latest developments in requirements and afforded flexibilities.

Healight Platform Technology has been exclusively licensed to Aytu BioScience Inc for worldwide commercial development and release which could mean that hospitals around the globe may soon adopt this approach.

According to some reports this method has been billed as being a potential “first-in-class treatment for coronavirus and other respiratory infections,” that utilizes proprietary methods of administering intermittent UVA light using a novel endotracheal device. Preclinical study findings are suggesting that this approach has the potential to help eradicate the spread of this COVID-19 outbreak, as well as “a wide range of viruses and bacteria, inclusive of coronavirus.”

A team from the Medically Associated Science and Technology Program at Cedars-Sinai led by Dr. Mark Pimental, MD have been developing Healight since 2016, and it has a growing body of evidence demonstrating its efficacy as both an antiviral and an antibacterial treatment.

There have been rumors of talks with the FDA about the development of a near term path that could enable early use of this technology to help the COVID-19 patients who are suffering in ICUs, and it may also be useful in treating ventilator associated pneumonia, or VAP.

""Our team has shown that administering a specific spectrum of UV-A light can eradicate viruses in infected human cells (including coronavirus) and bacteria in the area while preserving healthy cells,"" stated Dr. Pimentel of Cedars-Sinai. Ali Rezaie, MD, one of the inventors of this technology states, ""Our lab at Cedars-Sinai has extensively studied the effects of this unique technology on bacteria and viruses. Based on our findings we believe this therapeutic approach has the potential to significantly impact the high morbidity and mortality of coronavirus-infected patients and patients infected with other respiratory pathogens. We are looking forward to partnering with Aytu BioScience to move this technology forward for the benefit of patients all over the world.""

The FDA, Aytu, and Cedars-Sinai are rumored to be working together towards developing a plan for the expedited regulatory approval of Healight to be used against the continued battle against the global COVID-19 outbreak. Those critical ill with this virus may benefit from use of this minimally invasive treatment approach.

Around the globe many hospitals are already using UV light to help clean surfaces and disinfect rooms where COVID-19 patients have been treated, extending the use of such technology to the direct treatment of the virus in patients would appear to be the next logical step.

Natural UV light from the sun appears to be able to destroy most harmful bacteria on the skin as well as viruses and other microbes, similar benefit could also potentially be gained from using artificial UV rays generated by medical devices, and this is what Aytu and Cedars-Sinai are hoping will be widely implemented around the globe.

“We are honored to be partnering with Cedars-Sinai as we believe the Healight therapeutic platform has the potential to help many patients during this coronavirus pandemic and beyond.This first-in-class technology has the potential to be a game changer for clinicians treating patients infected with coronavirus and other respiratory conditions, and our team is working tirelessly alongside the Cedars-Sinai team to determine the safety and effectiveness of this device in humans,” says Josh Disbrow, Chairman and CEO of Aytu BioScience.",Low,,USA,0

NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease has released preliminary data showing the study meeting the primary outcome of statistical improvement in time to recovery by day 29; patients who were treated showed a median time to recovery of 22 days compared to 15 days for those receiving placebo. Additional data will be released while the study with results is being submitted for publication in a peer reviewed journal.

“Although a 31% improvement doesn’t seem like a knockout 100%, it is a very important proof of concept. What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,” NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, MD, said today during an appearance with President Donald Trump. “This will be the standard of care.” To which the president added, “It’s a beginning. That means you build on it. But it’s a very positive event.”

This is the first clinical study launched in America of a possible therapeutic for the COVID-19 virus. Remdesivir is among 18 other candidates that are designated as being the front runners among over 160 other possible therapeutics that are under study that can be viewed in GEN updated A-List by clicking here.

Remdesivir had a mortality rate of 8% compared to 11% of those receiving placebo, the agency suggests that this is a survival benefit to the nucleotide prodrug. This trial (ACCTT; NCT04280705) is an adaptive, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial evaluating 1,063 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with a broad range of symptoms; and is one of three randomized blinded Phase III studies assessing the drug candidate involving a total of 68 sites (47 in America and 21 in Europe and Asia).

“Based upon their review of the data, they noted that remdesivir was better than placebo from the perspective of the primary endpoint, time to recovery,” NIAID stated. “Recovery in this study was defined as being well enough for hospital discharge or returning to normal activity level.”

“Accumulating data on Remdesivir suggests it’s active against COVID and there’s now enough data to support consideration of access under an emergency use authorization by FDA. The data from NIAID study should push this firmly over the line,” writes Scott Gottlieb, MD, former FDA Commissioner.

However, not everyone is as excited including Eric Topol, MD, who is the director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute who cautions “The new remdesivir data from Tony Fauci from N >1,000 placebo-controlled trial (unpublished, Oval Office citation) does not show statistically significant reduction in mortality (8% vs 11%, in the right direction) but a clear-cut benefit in time to recovery 11 vs 15 days, P<0.001.”

This was just one of the two remdesivir studies that data was released for, as the Lancet published results showing that the drug candidate failed to show clinical improvements in severely infected patients in a Chinese Phase III trial (NCT04257656); this trial was a randomised, double blinded, placebo controlled multicenter trial in which remdesivir failed to reduce the presence of the virus in the bloodstream of 158 patients who were treated with the candidate in the 237 patient trial.

Primary endpoint in this trial was time to clinical improvement up to day 28, the average time to clinical improvement was 21 days for those treated and 23 for those receiving placebo. 28 days after treatment 13.9% of those in the remdesivir cohort died compared to 12.8% of the placebo group. Of the secondary outcomes 11.3% in the treatment group died within 10 days of illness onset compared to 14.9% of the placebo group.11.6% of the treatment group were taken off of the drug candidate due to side effects compared to 5.1% of the placebo group; adverse effects were reported from 65.8% of the remdesivir group compared to 64.1% of the placebo group.

16,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/latest-medical-findings-suggest-blood-clotting-covid-19/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-04-28,[],The Latest Medical Findings Suggest Blood Clotting In COVID-19,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_162220599.jpeg,"Another mysterious and deadly complication that appears to be showing up in the front lines fighting the outbreak of COVID-19 is blood flow impeded by blood clots; the thrombotic events are occurring for a variety of reasons among those in intensive care, but the rates among COVID-19 patients are substantially higher than would otherwise be expected.

""I have had 40-year-olds in my ICU who have clots in their fingers that look like they'll lose the finger, but there's no other reason to lose the finger than the virus,"" Shari Brosnahan, a critical care doctor at NYU Langone told AFP.

After spending 3 weeks in an ICU with COVID-19 actor Nick Cordero’s doctors were forced to amputate his left leg. Another patient at NYU is suffering from lack of blood flow to both feet and hands and an amputation may be required or the blood vessels may become so damaged the extremity could fall off by itself.

Blood clots are not only dangerous to limbs they can also find their way to the lungs, heart, or brain to cause lethal pulmonary embolisms, stroke, or heart attack. A recent study from the Netherlands published in the journal Thrombosis Research indicates that 31% of 184 COVID-19 patients suffered thrombotic complications.

Another study published in the Journal of The American College of Cardiology found the risk of thrombotic complications to be so great that COVID-19 patients “may need to receive blood thinners, preventively, prophylactically,"" even before imaging tests are ordered, said Behnood Bikdeli who is a doctor at New York–Presbyterian Hospital.

Although it is not known exactly why this is happening there are several explanations such as those with severe forms of COVID-19 with underlying medical conditions such as heart or lung disease are linked to higher rates of clotting even without being infected. Also being in an ICU can make a person more likely to develop a clot as they are remaining still for too long. Infection with COVID-19 is associated with an abnormal cytokine storm immune reaction that research indicates is also linked to higher rates of blood clotting.

Something about the COVID-19 virus itself may be causing coagulation, which does have some precedent in other viral illnesses. A study published in the journal The Lancet shows that the virus can infect the inner layer of organs and of blood vessel endothelium, which could in theory interfere with the clotting process.

Brosnahan suggests that thinners may be effective in some COVID-19 patients but they may not work for all patients because the clots may be too small at times. ""There are too many microclots,"" she said. ""We're not sure exactly where they are."" In fact, autopsies have shown some people’s lungs, bowels, livers, and kidneys who have lost their battle with the virus to be filled with hundreds of microclots.

Hooman Poor, MD, a pulmonologist and critical care specialist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, has been studying lab results of COVID-19 patients and found that many have high levels of D-dimer protein pieces, which are left over when the body breaks up blood clots, he believes that many patient’s bodies are trying desperately but failing to clear blood clots.

Around the globe those caring for COVID-19 patients are finding that when they draw blood it clots in the tubes, when catheters are inserted for kidney dialysis and IV line to draw blood the tubes quickly become clogged with clots.

""Patients are making clots all over the place,"" says Adam Cuker, MD, a hematologist and associate professor of medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. ""That's making management of these patients very challenging.""

Sharon Fox, MD, PhD a pathologist at Louisiana State University Health in New Orleans has been conducting autopsies on those who have lost their battle with COVID-19, so far they share something in common, they are riddled with blood clots in the smallest vessels of the body, especially the lungs where there these tiny clots appear to have cut of blood flow to the small air sacs where blood cells would be exchanging oxygen and carbon dioxide.

“I've never had a series of cases like this, where they all look the same, and all of the lungs have a similar pattern. There are types of vascular injury at autopsy that I haven't seen before. I would say it's new,"" says Fox, adding that the pattern of damage is striking. ""There's no ability for the blood to flow through and exchange oxygen like it should,"" she says.

“We still need more controlled data, but based on clinical observations and the few studies that have been published, it looks like thrombosis [blood clotting] is more common in these patients,"" Cuker says.

This new mystery may help to solve the slightly older one, as lungs that are filled with microclots may explain why ventilators work so poorly for patients with low blood oxygen. Earlier into this outbreak doctors were treating patients with protocols developed for wet lungs, but in some cases it may not be due to the lungs being occupied with water, rather it may be that microclotting is blocking circulation and blood is leaving the lungs with less oxygen than it should.

""While we react surprised, we shouldn't be as surprised as we were. Viruses tend to do weird things,"" said Brosnahan, and while the array of complications may seem daunting, ""it's possible there'll be one or a couple of unifying mechanisms that describe how this damage happens,"" she said. ""It's possible it's all the same thing, and that there'll be the same solution.""

Another study published in the Lancet has reported evidence of viral bodies of this novel coronavirus invading endothelial cells, which is the lining of our blood vessels that directs important functions of the vascular system, like clotting and swelling. Co-author Mandeep Mehra, MD, medical director of the Brigham and Women's Heart and Vascular Center in Boston suggests this virus can directly infect the endothelium, ""This is actually a disease of the endothelium,"" he says.

Mehra thinks the infection only begins in the lungs because breathing is the easiest entry, once infected lungs cells begin to be destroyed and the virus then travels into the bloodstream where it infects endothelial cells causing endotheliitis. This comes from not only the direct infection but also from the cytokine storm that was launched to fight it off. Mehra believes his theory of infection may explain some of the puzzle to COVID-19.

This theory may explain why those with certain conditions are also the ones who get the sickest when infected, and it may help to explain why those with low blood oxygen may not have lungs as stiff as they would be in others with respiratory distress or pneumonia. One of the consequences to endotheliitis is the blood vessels are not able to constrict as normal. When a part of the lungs becomes damaged blood vessels in that area close off so that blood will flow to a part of the lung that is still working. This is to protect the body from a sudden oxygen drop, this system appears to break down with COVID-19 infection, and Mehra believes infection of the endothelium is to blame.

According to Mehra this clotting is a feature of COVID-19, when it becomes the biggest problem the disease has advanced to become very severe, for this reason treating the resulting blood clots may not work, and may explain why ventilators are not helping more patients. One study in New York City hospitals estimates that of 5,700 patitens 12% needed a ventilator but 88% of those died.

“It's not acting like influenza or other bacteria pneumonia where you get inflammation in the lungs and fluid buildup and very stiff lungs. That doesn't seem to be the case, at least early on,"" Poor says. ""The virus is acting as if its primary target is the endothelium,"" he says.

These clots may explain part of the mystery, but the clots themselves are just another part of a much larger problem, one that hopefully doctors can solve soon.",Low,,USA,0

This research is demonstrating that cycles of fasting or fasting mimicking diets followed by refeeding a normal diet promotes stem cell dependent rejuvenation of the immune system in old mice. Early clinical trials show this process of cleaning up older white blood cells during a short period of fasting promoting restoration of normal levels of infection fighting cells when fasting is stopped may also occur in humans to provide potential health benefits.

These findings support clinical trials to investigate whether they will be effective in improving immune system function in elderly population without detrimental side effects and increasing vaccination efficacy in older adults; and according to Longo upcoming trials will examine the fasting mimicking diet’s effect on flu, and if funded when it becomes available, coronavirus vaccination in humans.

""We want to see if certain dietary interventions that can make a virus less infectious or cause fewer negative effects,"" Longo says.

Due to immunosenescence vaccine efficacy and strengthening the immune system is important to older adults, which is the gradual decline of immune system function and with it comes the increased risk of serious complications from viral infections.

Previous trials of a fasting mimicking diet demonstrated decreased cardiovascular disease risk factors as well as fasting glucose and reduced levels of IGF-1, and shrinking waistlines that resulted in weight loss in total body fat and total trunk fat but not muscle mass. The fasting mimicking diet also appeared to sensitize cancer cells to chemotherapy and lessen the treatment side effects in those with cancer.

Those involved in the trial were placed on special diet and required them to eat foods that were supplied by L-Nutra during the fasting periods of 5 days per each month; the diet was designed to mimic the results of a water only fasting period that allowed for participants to consume between 750-1,100 calories each day with the meals containing precise proportions of fats, proteins, and carbs.

Longo cautions that even though the results are very promising any kind of fasting or fasting mimicking diet should only be undertaken after consulting with a physician and followed under that guidance, especially for those that have been diagnosed or are suspected to have a disease.

The current state of affairs having shelter in place and stay at home orders may provided an opportunity for those who are overweight or gaining weight to try this diet plan, but it is important that in the face of this potential illness it is key for everyone to stay well nourished in general, especially for those that have been deemed as essential workers who are the highest risk for possible exposure to this novel COVID-19 virus.

During this pandemic Longo encourages everyone to follow a healthy balanced diet like the Mediterranean diet versus a long term restrictive low calorie diet, as the immune system can get depressed with a poor diet or one that is too restrictive and put you at an increased risk of infection.

UPDATED 4-18-20

There is increasing evidence that COVID-19 isn’t your typical virus. Thankfully many researchers, scientists and doctors are observing trends that are changing the way we are treating it in hospitals and at home.

I should be writing this at the beginning of all my articles in the last month but due to the fact that we are all living in real time and the information coming out is changing moment by moment even the best scientist’s theories on how to combat this illness continue to evolve. Although things could certainly change as larger studies come forth, for the moment I wanted to share with you some exciting new details that are emerging theories, which could affect future treatment development.

Current Theory and Treatment for Coronavirus

Currently COVID-19 is being treated as a dysfunction of the lower respiratory tract. It’s primary symptoms are:(1)

Fever Cough Shortness of breath

Interestingly, a large number of COVID-19 patients also report a loss of taste and smell. In mild cases of COVID-19, the virus will run its course and resolve on its own. But if this disease progresses to a critical level, patients spiral into a state of severe hypoxemia – where the body is unable to effectively deliver life-sustaining oxygen to the rest of the body. Without adequate oxygen delivery, vital organs and tissues are starved of oxygen and begin shutting down – which can eventually lead to death.

The current treatments assume that coronavirus is causing a build-up of liquid (instead of air) in the alveoli – making it difficult for oxygen to transfer through the fluid and make its way into the bloodstream. To counteract oxygen deprivation caused by this build up of fluid, COVID-19 is currently being treated as a case of acute respiratory distress, also known as ARDS. The standard treatment for ARDS is mechanical ventilation – which will force air into the alveoli in hopes of transferring oxygen into the blood.

The problem is, treating COVID-19 with ventilation isn’t working like it should. In fact, some doctors have observed that the use of ventilators may even be harming some patients. So that brings up the question – what if our current understanding of COVID-19 is wrong?

Emerging ideas on the virus…

There is mounting evidence suggesting that our initial understanding of exactly how coronavirus impacts the body may be incorrect.

Consider these mysteries of COVID-19:

Patients are showing blood oxygen levels so low that they should be life-threatening, but without showing the typical signs of distress that are expected when the same levels are reached due to lung dysfunction. (2) Doctors are saying that ventilators aren’t working as well as they should be and may even be harming some people. (2) Many patients report a loss of taste and smell, typically associated with zinc deficiency, not respiratory disease. Researchers have noted that the pathological mechanism that causes the damage to the body remains a mystery. (3) Twenty percent of COVID-19 patients have cardiac damage. (4) Fatality rates, even among places with robust testing in place, are wildly different.

These discrepancies have hinted at a new culprit as well as new possible solutions. So, should we be treating COVID-19 differently? To answer that question, first let’s look at exactly how a healthy body is designed to deliver oxygen to your tissues.

How Our Cells Are Designed Carry Oxygen

As you inhale air, oxygen enters your lungs and reaches the alveoli which is lined with a layer of cells that creates the barrier between your lungs and your bloodstream. Oxygen molecules pass through this barrier and attach themselves to a protein called hemoglobin that is bound to your red blood cells. Once your red blood cells have picked up oxygen, they set off to begin delivering it to the rest of the tissues in your body.

Think of your red blood cells like little rafts that are responsible for picking up oxygen and carrying it to your tissues which rely on oxygen for survival. And think of hemoglobin like people on the raft working as a delivery crew – tasked with receiving, holding, and dropping off oxygen molecules. Without the “delivery crew” of hemoglobin proteins, the raft is useless.

It’s also important to understand a little more about the structure of hemoglobin. A vital component of hemoglobin proteins are heme groups – which are embedded in the hemoglobin and are responsible for binding and releasing oxygen molecules.These heme groups are a metal complex and contain iron as the central metal atom, with each iron molecule capable of carrying one oxygen molecule.5 These iron rich heme groups are critical – without them your cells are unable to transport the oxygen your tissues depend on.

This understanding the body carries oxygen has sparked speculation about how COVID-19 may be exerting it’s devastating effects by creating more reactive oxygen species causing tissue damage and hypoxia.

A New Theory on COVID-19’s Mechanism of Injury

One the most puzzling aspects of COVID-19, is that despite fitting most of the criteria under the definition of acute respiratory failure there is one glaring contradiction. With the coronavirus, there appears to be hypoxia or low oxygen saturation in the blood rather than respiratory distress as seen in classic respiratory failure. Meaning many patients present with severe hypoxia with nearly normal respiratory function.6 This remarkable combination is almost never seen in severe cases of ARDS.

Interestingly, it may be creating a clinical picture similar to someone suffering from severe malaria or altitude illness.

Could COVID-19 Be affecting Oxygen Carrying Capacity?

In COVID-19’s final and severe stages, the lungs are severely damaged. But new information on this virus’s cellular process in the body is revealing that the final condition of the lungs and accompanying respiratory failure may actually be more of a case of massive oxidative stress overload disrupting the capacity of hemoglobin to carry oxygen to tissues rather than an outright attack on the air sacs in the lungs.

The theory on coronavirus affecting the blood's oxygen carrying capacity is related to the fact that increased intracellular oxidative stress is at the core of all pathogenic infections. This is often referred to as an increase in reactive oxygen species or ROS. This ROS production is at the core of much of the damage we are seeing not only to the blood’s ability to deliver oxygen to the tissues, causing severe hypoxia or low oxygen but also damaging all tissues they come in contact with. As Integrative and functional medicine doctors, we often measure markers of oxidative stress in our patient’s urine to determine if this process is out of control. One such marker is lipid peroxides. According to Dr. Tom Levy the intracellular levels of Vitamin C, magnesium and glutathione largely affect the oxidative stress which could damage the tissues, one reason why you are seeing Vitamin C being used in hospitals to treat the virus. Stay tuned as I will be writing more about Vitamin C in upcoming blog articles.

This cascade of events would explain:

Why as many as one in five COVID-19 patients have cardiac damage. Why IV nutrients that target cardiovascular function are beneficial. Why many people experience a loss of taste and smell. Why anti-malarial medications are showing promising results.

This would also explain why ventilators aren’t working quite like we’d expect. Ventilators work by forcing more air into the lungs, so more oxygen can be delivered to the blood. This is helpful when there’s liquid or inflammation in the lungs, and the blood is working normally – like in pneumonia. However, if there is an issue due to the fact that oxidative stress (ROS) has altered the blood’s ability to properly carry this oxygen, then a ventilator can’t do its job. Right now, the Journal of the American Medical Association indicates that COVID-19 patients are candidates for “early, invasive ventilation”. But if we’re ventilating patients who are struggling to keep their little oxygen boats afloat in the bloodstream due to massive oxidative stress, ventilation will do little good and could even cause damage.(8)

This theory would also give us some more insight as to why certain populations may be more at risk of contracting COVID-19.

This Might Explain Why Anti-malarial Medications are Being Considered for Treatment.

Hydroxychloroquine, also known as Plaquenil, is an anti-malarial medication that is showing promise as a potential treatment for COVID-19. If coronavirus is in fact attacking red blood cells, similar to the way malaria does, then it would make sense why an anti-malarial drug would be beneficial for coronavirus patients. But how exactly could hydroxychloroquine be exerting these antiviral effects?

Research is finding that it might be due to hydroxychloroquine’s relationship with the mineral zinc. You see, hydroxychloroquine is a zinc ionophore – meaning it enhances your body’s ability to allow zinc into your cells.9 When intracellular concentrations of zinc are increased, it displays broad spectrum antiviral activity in a few ways:

Zinc inhibits the actions of certain proteins necessary for the completion of different phases of the virus’s life cycle – essentially halting its ability to reproduce(10) Zinc supports a robust immune response by aiding in the production of cytokines and the modulation of immune cells(10) Zinc acts as a powerful antioxidant and prooxidant – neutralizing the oxidative stress caused by toxic overload of iron that has been dumped into the blood from the burst cells(11,12)

Interestingly, one of the initial symptoms reported by many coronavirus patients is a loss of taste and smell. This lack of taste and smell can be caused by a zinc deficiency. Perhaps the action of hydroxychloroquine helping zinc enter cells is part of the reason the drug has benefitted some COVID-19 patients.13 It’s important to note that in order for hydroxychloroquine to work, there must be adequate zinc levels available to allow into the cells – so hydroxychloroquine must be administered in conjunction with zinc to be most effective against COVID-19.

Hydroxychloroquine has shown promise (as well as a risk of severe cardiac arrhythmia in certain patients) but the way the drug functions has given us some powerful insights and may give us answers into how we can save more lives.

The Connection Between COVID-19 and Altitude Sickness

Another interesting connection is the fact that COVID-19’s clinical presentation is quite similar to another respiratory illness – high altitude pulmonary edema, also known as altitude sickness. In both COVID-19 and high altitude pulmonary edema clinical findings include:(14)

A decreased ratio of arterial oxygen levels to inspired oxygen Hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and tachypnea (abnormally rapid breathing) Low carbon dioxide levels A ground glass appearance in the lung tissues Elevated fibrinogen levels Diffuse alveolar damage

In altitude sickness, the lungs are functioning fine – there are just inadequate levels of oxygen to process to properly meet the needs of the body. Clinical findings similar to altitude sickness would make sense if COVID-19 is in fact causing a dysfunction of red blood cells through production of massive oxidative stress rather than a direct problem with the lungs.

So What Are Potential Options to Quench Oxidative Stress?

Even with all of the information that points to COVID-19 creating massive oxidative stress, there are still a lot of unknowns. The downside of this is of course the trial and error and continued research that needs to take place before we have real answers. The upside, is that this information gives us an array of new potential treatment options to consider:

High Dose Vitamin C:

High doses of vitamin C are garnering attention as a powerful way to potentially mitigate the effects of coronavirus. These ultra-high doses of vitamin C are speculated to fight the massive immune response and subsequent respiratory failure seen in coronavirus infection by:(15,16)

Suppressing the over-reactive inflammatory response in the lungs Minimizing the accumulation of immune cells in the tissues of the lungs Decreasing the release of cytokines (chemical messengers involved in the immune response) Slowing down the viruses ability to reproduce and spread Neutralizing the oxidative stress caused by the massive amounts of iron floating around in the bloodstream

Ideally, high dose vitamin C can be delivered intravenously, where it is more easily absorbed and utilized intracellularly. But oral vitamin C can also be beneficial if taken correctly. While regular over the counter oral vitamin C causes diarrhea, liposomal Vitamin C at frequent intervals does not, and is an effective way to increase intracellular levels. Several New York hospitals have approved intravenous vitamin C as a therapy for the first time ever in studies being conducted on the virus.

Glutathione:

Glutathione is a potent antioxidant naturally found in most of the cells in your body. Glutathione plays a few major roles in immune function including:

Functioning as a signaling molecule – helping balance inflammation levels and modulating immune system response(17) Reducing oxidative injury by neutralizing harmful toxins (18) Regulating cellular proliferation and apoptosis(19)

There is a growing mountain of evidence finding that the most effective way to take glutathione may be through inhalation. Inhaled glutathione (aerosolized or nebulized) is already being used in the treatment of a variety of respiratory-related conditions and has been garnering attention as a possible treatment option for COVID-19.(20)

Inhaled Hydrogen:

The inhalation of concentrated hydrogen gas is another potential treatment option due to its powerful antioxidant properties. Inhaling hydrogen gas has been found to:(21,22)

Reduce oxidative-stress induced damage Reduce cellular apoptosis Improve gas exchange in the lungs Block the production of proinflammatory mediators

Inhaled hydrogen gas may be particularly effective when paired with other anti-oxidative therapies such as IV vitamin C and inhaled glutathione.

Other Antiviral Drugs:

A number of other antiviral medications are being studied for their potential to treat COVID-19. These include:

Methylene Blue : Methylene Blue is a medication that has been used in the treatment of malaria due to its powerful antiviral properties – killing the virus at an impressive speed. (23) It’s also used in the treatment of a condition known as methemoglobinemia – a condition in which individuals have too much methemoglobin which is a form of hemoglobin that is much less effective at carrying oxygen. Methylene blue works by converting methemoglobin into a type of hemoglobin that can more effectively transport oxygen.(24) Remdesivir : Remdesivir is another antiviral drug used for Ebola. Remdesivir is showing benefit in solid studies – a small but well-conducted study on severe cases in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan concluded that Remdesvir caused clinical improvement in 68% of patients. (25) Favipiravir : Favipiravir is a powerful anti-viral agent that inhibits the virus from replicating and spreading. (26) It has been approved in China and Japan for the treatment of influenza and is undergoing research to determine its potential efficacy in treating COVID-19. (27)

Hyperbaric Treatment:

Hyperbaric treatment works in two ways. First, inspired oxygen concentration is increased to nearly 100%. Secondly, ambient pressure is increased to about three times higher than the air pressure we normally breathe. This combination is designed to essential “hyper oxygenate” your blood – improving oxygen delivery to your tissues.(28)

Hyperbaric treatment may be an effective adjunct therapy to help COVID-19 patients recover, especially when administered early.

Could This Bring Us One Step Closer to Finding a Cure for COVID-19?

There are still many unknowns when it comes to coronavirus. The only thing we know for certain is that we are in a race against time. I hope we will continue to search for clues and change course when wrong.

I urge my fellow clinicians and researchers to examine this virus and its mechanism of action with fresh eyes. We entered into this field knowing we were signing up for being lifetime students. This current pandemic is calling us to rise to the occasion – the world is counting on us to find the answers it needs.

In my own practice, I will continue to give my patients and readers the most up-to-date tools they need to protect themselves amidst this pandemic. Until we have a solid understanding of this virus, I will continue to seek new information to do my part in fighting back against COVID-19 and update you when we find more information to help patients get well.

Give Your Immune System the Support It Needs

Along with continued research to identify the root cause of COVID-19, I am also working on equipping our clinic to offer treatments to support your immune system during this time. Based on our current understanding we may consider offering some of the following options.

IV Vitamin C and Glutathione: A powerful combination of two of the most potent antioxidants delivered intravenously so they can be immediately used by the cells to combat oxidative damage. Inhaled Glutathione: Inhaling glutathione delivers it directly to your lung cells – replenishing their antioxidant stores that are quickly used up when fighting inflammation. Inhaled Hydrogen: Pairing inhaled hydrogen’s impressive anti-inflammatory effects with Vitamin C and glutathione makes for a robust and powerful trio of antioxidant therapies. Nasal Ozone: Ozone gas held in the sinuses helps your body more effectively uptake oxygen and activates a healthy immune response. Ozone should not be inhaled as may damage the lungs.

And fortunately, Flatiron Functional Medicine is certainly not the only place that you may be able to receive these powerful therapies to support the immune system. Many other providers have the resources and training to deliver them as well – so please seek out a reputable and trusted clinician in your area to learn more about these options.",Low,,USA,0

Previously the federal organization listed fever, cough, and shortness of breath as symptoms of possible infections, now with the addition of “chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and new loss of taste or smell,” the total has been brought to nine. The additions were made because people “have had a wide range of symptoms reported,” the agency writes on their website in what is the first time they have increased the number of signs of the disease.

These additions have been reported by many who have been confirmed to have COVID-19. But these are not the only symptoms being widely reported in common to those confirmed with the virus, others are reported to include skin rash, runny nose, red eyes, diarrhea, and fatigue. Additionally left untreated it does not take like for even mild symptoms to turn serious as the virus invades the lungs.

According to the CDC those who have “trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in their chest, new confusion or inability to arouse or have bluish lips or face” should seek immediate medical attention.

From the CDC website:

Older adults and those with severe underlying medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes seem to be at a higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19 illness.

Those with COVID-19 have a wide range of symptoms reported, ranging from mild symptoms to severe illness.

These symptoms may appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus:

Fever

Cough

Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing

Chills

Repeated shaking with chills

Muscle pain

Headache

Sore throat

New loss of taste or smell

If you develop any of these following emergency warning signs for COVID-19 get medical attention immediately:

Trouble breathing

Persistent pain or pressure in the chest

New confusion or inability to arouse

Bluish lips or face

*This list is not all inclusive. Please consult your medical provider for any other symptoms that are severe or concerning to you.

Call 911 if you have a medical emergency: Notify the operator that you have, or think you might have COVID-19. If possible put on a cloth face covering before medical help arrives.",Low,,USA,0
20,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/ceo-says-covid-19-antibody-testing-disaster/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-04-23,[],CEO Says COVID-19 Antibody Testing Is A Disaster,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_28459898.jpeg,"Severin Schwan the CEO of Roche says that the current state of antibody testing is a disaster, as a large number of potentially inaccurate tests have rapidly entered the market which has been fueled by a very high demand.

Worldwide countries are looking towards serology testing in order to gain a better understanding of whether citizens are developing immunity against COVID-19, but reports detailing high rates of either false positives or false negatives are delaying widespread screening.

“These tests are not worth anything, or have very little use,” Schwan said during an early Wednesday conference call regarding the company’s first-quarter earnings, according to Reuters.

“Some of these companies, I tell you, this is ethically very questionable to get out with this stuff,” he said, adding that Roche analyzed several products currently on the market and found them to be unreliable. “Every kind of amateur could produce an antibody test,” he said. “The two of us could do it overnight in the garage.”

Roche is working on developing its own antibody test which the company says should be set to launch in May. Their test will run using the company’s high throughput Elecsys assay platform and conas line of analysers which the company is working with the FDA to secure an Emergency Use Authorization for, that allows developers to distribute self validated serology testing ahead of an official review.

Roche’s diagnostic chief Thomas Schinecker has offered his view in another interview: “From a technological perspective, with a test using a finger prick, you will never get as good a result as if you take the blood from the vein,” Schinecker said, describing the design of certain antibody and point-of-care tests, which use a simpler testing strip instead of laboratory hardware. “I would take those results with caution.”

So far this year the FDA has fast tracked the emergency authorization of Roche’s molecular test kits for active cases of COVID-19 infection and the sales within this diagnostic division have increased 5% to reach about $3 billion. Overall molecular testing sales have increased by 29% which has been largely driven by this recent outbreak with routine health checks decreasing.

Growth has been reported around the globe with the exception of the Asia Pacific region which had an 11% drop following COVID-19 related shutdowns in China; due to later onset of the outbreak demands in Europe, North America, and Latin America has been less affected in the first quarter. The company says that its supply chain for medicines and tests remains intact and that sales are expected to continue to increase driven by new drugs, diagnostics, and lab hardware.

“In a pandemic, your healthcare infrastructure is stretched,” said Schwan. “I have no doubt in my mind, because now there is such a huge public awareness in countries where it is not working well and that it needs to be upgraded. As far as Roche is concerned, I have no doubt that people will invest more in high-throughput testing systems,” he added. “The countries that had them did extremely well.”

The company is working on developing its own multiple assay as a point of care test for active infections, and they are making strides towards overcoming the trade-offs between accuracy and ability to produce fast results virtually anywhere, says Schinecker.

“We want to make sure we hit the target performance that lives up to the standard we set ourselves,” he said. “You want to make sure it performs as close to a lab test.”

As far as serology testing goes there are still a lot of unknowns about exactly how the body’s production of antibodies will actually translate to immunity to disease or for how long, especially for a novel one such as it is with this outbreak of COVID-19.

“But society has no other chance than to work with these hypotheses,” Schinecker said. “We cannot wait for all the data to be there.”",Low,,USA,0
21,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/swedens-approach-dealing-covid-19/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-04-22,[],Sweden’s Approach To Dealing With COVID-19,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_319465164.jpeg,"Ander Tegnell the epidemiologist behind the country’s controversial strategy recently had an interview with Nature to explain the “trust based” approach to tackling the COVID-19 outbreak, the following is an excerpt of that interview:

Much of the world has imposed severe restrictions on public life in recent months to try and slow the spread of this virus, among them there is one country standing out from the crowd: Sweden. In this country there is no lock down or strict social distancing policies. Rather this country has imposed a voluntary trust based measure that advises those who are older or with existing conditions to avoid social contact; it recommends people work from home, wash their hands regularly, and people should avoid non-essential travel.

Another more glaring difference is that in Sweden the borders and schools for children under the age of 16 remain open, as do many businesses including bars and restaurants. Their unique approach is gaining attention from critics among whom 22 scientists wrote an article in the newspaper Dagens Nyheter that public health authorities are failing and they urged politicians to step in an impose stricter measures pointing to a high number of deaths in elder care homes and the overall fatality rate which is the highest reported of the Nordic neighbours.

Ander Tegnell is an epidemiologist at the Public Health Agency in Sweden and is the architect behind their strategy who suggests that it is overstated how unique their approach is, as they too are aiming to flatten the curve to slow down the spread as much as possible as to not collapse the healthcare system.

Tegnell says this is not a disease that can be stopped or eradicated, as such there needs to be long term solutions that keep the distribution of infections at a decent level. Every country is trying to keep people apart by using the same measures and traditions, and this is one of the reasons they ended up doing things slightly different.

The laws on communicable diseases are mostly based on voluntary measures in Sweden, falling on an individual’s own responsibility, clearly stating that each citizen has the responsibility to not spread a disease. In Sweden using their present laws there is not much legal possibility to close down cities, a quarantine can be contemplated for people or small areas such as a hotel or a school but they legally are not able to lock down an entire geographical area.

In his view closing borders, lock downs and close downs have nothing to do with historical scientific basis, when they were investigating European countries to examine published analysis of the effects of these measures almost none were found. Thus in his opinion closing borders is ridiculous because COVID-19 is in every country now, and they have more concerns about movements inside of Sweden. In order to be effective those measures needed to be implemented immediately to be effective, as once it has spread it is too late.

In Sweden as a society they are more into nudging and continuously reminding people to use safety measures, working to improve measures as they are seen to need to be adjusted day to day, and there is no need to close everything down completely because it would be counterproductive.

Every morning the Swedish Public Health Agency meets to review and update decisions and adjust recommendations as needed according to data collection and analysis, talking to regional authorities twice a week.

Currently the big debate is regarding elder care homes where the country is registering a very unfortunate outbreak of the coronavirus which largely accounts for Sweden’s higher death rate as compared to the Nordic neighbors. To better understand which recommendations are not being followed and why not investigations are ongoing to make adjustments to try and correct the situation.

Although the country is being criticized for being too relaxed and possibly putting citizen lives at risk Tegnell does not believe there is that risk. Public health officials have released a detailed model on a region by region basis that comes to less pessimistic conclusions than that of other researchers in terms of hospitalizations and deaths per thousand infections. While there has been an increase in cases it is not traumatic so far, he says adding that the country is currently in a phase where there will be more cases during the next few weeks, just as every country either has or will experience, and nowhere in Europe has the spread been able to be slowed down considerably.

According to Tegnell the science does not support closing down schools at this point. In an epidemic to get an effect you have to shut things such as schools down early, and we are now close to the top of the curve so closing down schools would be meaningless at this point. It makes more sense along with being more instrumental for psychiatric and physical health that the younger generation remains active.

While there is a possibility asymptomatics are contagious, the amount of spread is mostly likely small compared to those showing symptoms as in the normal distribution of a bell curve asymptomatics sit at the margin whereas the majority of the curve is accountable to symptomatics which are the ones we really need to stop, says Tegnell.

Tegnell says that it is too early to know if their approach will be successful. Every country needs to reach herd immunity in one way or another, and Sweden is going to reach it in a different way. Some argue that keeping people in quarantine will limit their exposure and hault developing natural immunity needed to develop herd immunity. Just as the common cold or flu we once had no immunity, and many people died, which is the same as with this virus. Herd immunity is when a high proportion of the population becomes immune to an infection which largely limits the spread to those who are not immune, and quarantine undermines this process. According to Tegnell there are enough signals to show that we can think about herd immunity for this virus, how long it will last is unknown, but there is a definite immune response.

Tegnell believes that they underestimated the issues that would arise at elder care homes, and how the measures would or in this case would not be applied, and they should have controlled this more thoroughly in these communities.

Thus far he is satisfied with this strategy, and most of the problems the country is facing at the moment are not because of the disease, rather because the recommended measures in some environments have not been applied properly such as the deaths among older people which is a huge problem they are trying to fight hard against.

Looking at pandemics there are far worse scenarios than this one, Tegnell has data showing that the flu epidemic and winter norovirus dropped consistently this year which means that the social distancing and hand washing recommendations are working. Tracking models show that the movements in Swedes has fallen dramatically, and the voluntary strategy is having a real effect, adds Tegnell.",Low,,USA,0
22,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/what-private-practices-need-know-about-us-relief-package/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-05-20,[],What Private Practices Need to Know About the U.S. Relief Package,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/USRelief_A4M_ReBlog.png,"

There is a dire need for financial support of healthcare providers and facilities as they continue to battle the COVID-19 pandemic, now affecting the United States the most drastically. In response, the President signed the bipartisan CARES Act on March 27, 2020, providing much-needed relief funds to hospitals and other healthcare providers on the frontlines of the fight against coronavirus. As part of the recently announced CARES Act, $100 billion will be appropriated to create a Public Health Social Service Emergency Fund with an ultimate goal of preventing, preparing for, and responding to the coronavirus outbreak both domestically and on an international scale.

Per the Act, funding will be dedicated to reimbursing healthcare-related expenses or lost revenue attributable to COVID-19 to alleviate some of the financial burden many providers are experiencing. Part of this relief payment will focus on ensuring that uninsured Americans have access to testing and treatment, and that medical professionals providing the care are reimbursed for their work. The Department of Health and Human Services has published detailed criteria for the process of distribution of funds under the Act as well as information about eligibility requirements, outlined below.

Immediate Relief Funding

Recognizing the urgent need for the delivery of financial relief, the HHS immediately infused $30 billion into the American healthcare system. Payments are slated to arrive via direct deposit beginning April 10, 2020 to eligible providers throughout the system. Note, these are direct payments, not loans and will not need to be repaid, the HHS emphasizes.

Eligibility for Immediate Relief Payments

Per guidance from the HHS, all facilities and providers that received Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) reimbursements in 2019 are eligible to receive payments from this initial rapid distribution. Payments to practices that are part of larger medical groups will be sent to the group’s central billing office, while all relief payments will be made to the billing organization according to its Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN).

In order to be eligible to receive these funds, providers must not seek to collect of out-of-pocket payments from a COVID-19 patient that are greater than what they would be otherwise had the care been provided by an in-network practitioner. If a practice had to halt business operations as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, providers may still be eligible to receive funds if they provided diagnoses, testing, or care for patients with possible or confirmed cases of COVID-19. Per the HHS, “Care does not have to be specific to treating COVID-19. HHS broadly views every patient as a possible case of COVID-19.”

The immediate relief payments hope to alleviate providers in hard-hit COVID-19 areas and those who are struggling to keep their practice open due to delayed care and widespread cancellations of elective procedures.

Payment Distributions

Payment distributions will be based on the provider’s or practice’s share of total Medicare FFS reimbursements for the year 2019; that year, the total FFS payments were approximately $484 billion. Providers can estimate their anticipated payment by dividing their 2019 Medicare FFS (excluding Medicare Advantage) payments – which can be obtained from their organization’s revenue management system – by $484 billion and multiplying that ratio by $30 billion.

Receiving Payments

In partnership with UnitedHealth Group (UHG), the HHS will provide rapid payments to eligible providers, as described above, to distribute the initial round of funding. Providers will be paid via their Automated Clearing House account information on file with UHG or the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and can expect to receive payments via Optum Bank with “HHSPAYMENT” as the payment description. Providers who receive reimbursements from CMS via paper check can expect to receive a paper check in the mail within the next few weeks.

Providers must sign an attestation confirming receipt of the funds and agreeing to the terms and conditions of payment within 30 days of receipt. The Terms and Conditions of the funding can be found on the CMS website. If the payment is not returned within 30 days, the HHS will view this as an acceptance of the Terms and Conditions. However, if a provider does not wish to comply with the Terms and Conditions, they must contact HHS within 30 days of receipt of payment and then return the full payment to HHS.

Different Types of Providers

All relief payments are being made to providers according to their tax identification number (TIN). Large organizations will receive payments for each of their billing TINs that bill Medicare, and should look to the part of their organization that handles Medicare billing to identify details on Medicare payments for 2019. Employed physicians should not expect to receive an individual payment directly; instead, their employer’s organization will receive the relief payment as the billing organization. Similarly, individual physicians and providers in a group practice are unlikely to receive individual payments directly; the group practice will receive the relief fund payment as the billing organization. Solo practitioners who bill Medicare will receive a payment under the TIN they use to bill Medicare.

The Remaining $70 Billion

As part of the $100 billion guaranteed by the CARES Act, the remaining $70 billion will be comprised of targeted distributions focused on providers in areas particularly impacted by the virus, rural providers, providers of services with lower shares of Medicare reimbursement or who predominantly serve the Medicaid population, as well as providers requesting reimbursement for the treatment of uninsured Americans. More guidance is expected on the structure of these payments in the coming weeks.

COVID-19 Medical Expenses

The federal government is taking measures to ensure Americans are not surprised by medical expenses and are protected against financial obstacles that might prevent them from seeking care or getting tested and treated for COVID-19. A portion of the Provider Relief Fund will be used to reimburse healthcare providers at Medicare rates for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured. However, providers are prohibited from “balance billing” any patient for COVID-related treatment in order to be eligible.

In addition, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires private insurers to cover an insurance plan member’s cost-sharing payments for COVID-19 testing. Further, the government has secured commitments from private insurers – such as Humana, Cigna, UnitedHealthGroup, and the Blue Cross Blue Shield system – to waive cost-sharing payments for treatment related to COVID-19 for its members and make medical care more accessible.

Heavily anticipated by providers across the nation, the latest guidance helps to clarify eligibility, distribution, and payment concerns regarding the Provider Relief Fund. Eligible practices and providers may soon expect to receive payments from the immediate round of funding.

“We continue to work across all sectors to expedite the development of numerous innovative potential preventive and treatment approaches by both facilitating emergency access for patients, to the extent we can, and supporting the evaluation of potential therapies,” said FDA Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn, M.D. “With today’s authorization of a blood purification device, we are expediting the availability of a treatment option for patients in the ICU to help reduce the severity of the disease. Our staff will continue our around the clock review of all medical products to expedite the availability of treatments to help fight this devastating disease.”

The company’s CytoSorb purification system was previously cleared for use in the European Union to treat septic shock patients receiving intensive care as well as those undergoing heart surgery or those experiencing liver failure.

The FDA emergency authorization allows the filters to be used in American intensive care units for adults suffering from imminent respiratory failure with acute lung injuries or severe infection with COVID-19 disease.

As the body overreacts to the COVID-19 infection a cascading release of white blood cells creates a cytokine storm that can cause severe inflammation, tissue damage and rapidly progressive shock. These systems should help to filter out the proteins fueling the cytokine storm and help to save lives.

The company describes these filters as being plug and play compatible with most blood purification devices or pumps that can be found within an ICU such as dialysis or the lung supporting extracorporeal membrane oxygenation hardware machines.

""As a U.S.-based company with CytoSorb device manufacturing in New Jersey, we are eager to expand the availability of CytoSorb to U.S. hospitals and patients as a treatment option to fight cytokine storm and deadly inflammation that is believed to exacerbate COVID-19 infection,” said CytoSorbents CEO Philip Chan.

“With more than 555,000 documented coronavirus infections, the U.S. leads the world with over 22,000 deaths, and emergently needs new therapies to reduce the severity of this disease,” Chan added, as of early April 13. “This is important not just to reduce poor clinical outcomes and mortality, but to also alleviate the bottleneck for scarce resources such as ventilators and ECMO in the treatment of these critically ill patients.""

This system, according to the company, has been used in over 80,000 treatments overseas to assist with similar kinds of complications that are being seen in COVID-19, as well as with over 200 patients with this infection, and it is included in treatment guidelines in China, Italy, and Panama.

“Under the EUA, we plan to ramp the availability of CytoSorb in a controlled manner, to clinical centers that will work with us to generate data and leverage our knowledge of how to use the device most effectively,” Chan said.",Low,,USA,0

However, while having a fever, cough and shortness of breath may be the known classic symptoms of COVID-19 so far, there can also be gastrointestinal symptoms including diarrhea and nausea that may be getting missed according to a recent study.

The new study from Stanford Medicine has found that in addition to the upper respiratory symptoms a significant number of those who have been infected with this virus also suffered from loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

This is one of the earliest studies on American COVID-19 patients, and it was very recently published in Gastroenterology with gastroenterology fellows George Cholankeril, MD, and Alexander Podboy, MD sharing the lead authorship, and the senior author was Aijaz Ahmed, MD, professor of gastroenterology and hepatology.

""COVID-19 is probably not just respiratory symptoms like a cough,"" Podboy said. ""A third of the patients we studied had gastrointestinal symptoms. It's possible we may be missing a significant portion of patients sick with the coronavirus due to our current testing strategies focusing on respiratory symptoms alone.""

""George recognized early on that since Stanford was among the first hospitals to get COVID-19 patients in the U.S., that any type of early experience would be important,"" he said. ""We were in a unique position to look into this subject of gastrointestinal symptoms among coronavirus patients at Stanford.""

The team had been following the growing body of research emerging from Singapore and China showing the prevalence of GI tract symptoms in those infected with this virus, but they were not able to find any data on this topic involving American patients. Thus they designed their own study examining charts of the earliest groups of COVID-19 patients that were treated at Stanford Health Care.

Data was analyzed from 116 patients who were confirmed to be infected with the virus from March 4-24, 2020, with the majority being treated and released from a hospital ER or clinic, 33 of whom were hospitalized and 8 of those were in an intensive care unit. Median age was 50 with 53% of them being men and only one death was reported within this grouping.

In this grouping of COVID-19 patients gastrointestinal symptoms were reported by 31.9% of the patients with the majority of this group describing their symptoms as being mild; 22% reported experiencing loss of appetite, 22% experienced nausea and vomiting, and 12% experienced diarrhea according to the study.

""We also noticed that 40% of patients had elevated levels of an abnormal liver enzyme, and that those with high levels required more hospitalization,"" Cholankeril said.

Based on their findings, although this is early data from a single institution, there is indication of the possibility that those exposed to COVID-19 who are experiencing gastrointestinal symptoms and not just respiratory symptoms may also be infected and should also be tested.

""In our current cohort of patients, all patients had respiratory symptoms prior to the development of gastrointestinal symptoms,"" Podboy said. ""No patients had gastrointestinal symptoms prior to the development of respiratory symptoms or as their only manifestation of COVID-19. However, that may be a product of who we were testing. Currently, testing is only offered for patients that meet specific criteria—criteria that often require the presence of pulmonary symptoms.""

""We had six fellows working together and we were able to go through these charts pretty quickly,"" Cholankeril said. ""It was a terrific collaboration between colleagues to be able to join forces to study this new disease. We think that by looking at patients here at Stanford, it can help improve our understanding of this emerging disease.""

The team plans to continue their investigations to study the role of GI tract symptoms in COVID-19 and the implications on disease severity and outcomes, according to Cholankeril.",Low,,USA,0

In the United States, federal policies are being updated rapidly in response to the shifting demands of the healthcare system as it fights to curb the virus. As such, insurance providers are playing a critical role in ensuring widespread access to care and have taken decisive action to help both patients and providers in combating the novel coronavirus.

From state insurance regulators, who are limiting the amounts patients can owe for COVID-19 care, to insurance companies and employers who have amended many rules to eliminate deductibles and co-payments, coverage changes have been occurring on a large scale. As the outbreak is developing and dynamically changing the medical landscape, below are some of the latest policies to go into effect in response to COVID-19.

COVID-19 Testing

Per the latest legislation passed by Congress, coronavirus testing is free for all individuals regardless of insurance status – as is the cost of a doctor’s visit or trip to the emergency room to receive the test. The recently passed Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires all group health plans and individual health insurance providers to cover testing and associated visits related to the diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition, several states, including California, New York, and Washington have implemented additional requirements on insurance companies to cover testing costs.

Both private insurance companies and employers have volunteered to waive the costs of testing. In addition, the Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires most private health companies to cover testing for COVID-19.

Medicare and Medicaid will also cover the costs of a coronavirus test, while the uninsured should also be able to get tested at no cost per the latest guidelines. Patients who recently lost their jobs may qualify for Medicaid or be able to sign up for a health plan under the Affordable Care Act to gain access to free testing.

COVID-19 Treatment Costs

In response to the COVID-19 outbreak, health insurance providers are waiving out-of-pocket costs for hospital visits and many are funding treatment of COVID-19 as well. Cigna and Humana have waived out-of-pocket costs for treatment, as have Aetna, Florida Blue, Harvard Pilgrim and UnitedHealth Group. One of the largest insurers in the nation, Blue Cross and Blue Shield, covers nearly 6 million individuals under its Federal Employee Program and has said it would waive co-payments and deductibles for medically necessary treatment.

Although, there are restrictions to the coverage of treatment costs as some insurers have waived cost sharing only for the upcoming two months while others have eliminated expenses only for hospital stays. In addition, it remains unclear how much patients may be required to pay out of pocket; the Kaiser Family Foundation estimates COVID-19 care can cost around $20,000, bringing potential out-of-pocket bills to around $1,300 depending on the patient’s plan, location of care, and disease severity.

COVID-19 Complications Care

Most private insurance plans will likely cover services needed to treat COVID-19 complications although, there is currently no federal guidance requiring them to do so. In addition to covering testing, Medicare will cover both outpatient and hospitalization services. During the COVID-19 crisis, Medicare patients are covered if they need to be transferred to skilled care regardless of previous hospitalization. However, the program does not cover long-term stays in long-term care facilities at this time.

Telemedicine Coverage

According to the latest policy changes, telehealth will now be covered under Part B for all traditional Medicare enrollees for services not limited to COVID-19 care. The definition of telemedicine will be expanded to allow patients to connect with healthcare providers from their homes via video conferencing or other digital methods. To further ease access to care, the requirement that telemedical care be provided by a medical professional the patient has seen within the last three years has been waived.

The widespread shift to telehealth has proven critical to easing the burden on the U.S. healthcare system by “allowing hospitals to care for people who need it most, while limiting the exposure of health care workers and patients to the disease,” explains a one-pager published by America’s Health Insurance Plans. “Telehealth is especially beneficial for patients who are at a higher risk when leaving the home to commute to the doctor’s office.”

Out-of-Network Bills

Despite the significant efforts made toward expanding insurance coverage at this time, patients may still be required to pay out-of-network bills, for example, when they are treated by an out-of-network physician. Data from the Kaiser Family Foundation indicate that nearly one in five patients admitted to the hospital with serious cases of pneumonia were faced with out-of-network bills after treatment. To further ease patients’ financial burden related to COVID-19, some hospital systems are pausing collections for the foreseeable future.

Alongside the aforementioned updates, many insurance coverage providers are proposing further changes to expand coverage and ease the financial burden during this COVID-19 crisis. Healthcare providers should remain current on the latest developments in coverage policies as they may affect both themselves as well as their patients.

27,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/calls-helplines-america-increase-dramatically/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-05-14,[],Calls To Helplines In America Increase Dramatically,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_241549260.jpeg,"Calls to helplines are increasing in America by as much as 891%, experts are warning of a mental health crisis and some officials are worried that America is not prepared to meet with this issue as well.

Compared to this time last year the national hotline that provides emergency help to those suffering from emotional stress has received 9 times more calls, with tens of thousands of Americans reaching out for assistance amid the current outbreak, according to officials.

Officials on the front lines of this outbreak are warning of a mental health crisis that will likely continue to increase over the coming weeks that the agencies have yet to properly prepare for.

The administration has approved millions of dollars in federal funding to boost mental health services, but some officials are suggesting that even this additional money may not be enough to support the increased counseling that will be needed amidst this crisis in the coming weeks of shut downs, social distancing and isolation.

The Disaster Distress Helpline at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration experienced an 891% increase in call volume last month in comparison to March of 2019, according to a spokesperson for the agency.

March 2020 experienced 338% more calls to the helpline than February 2020 when the outbreak really began to take hold in America and officials began to take more extreme measures to stop its spread. While specific total figures were not given, last month the agency received more than 22,000 calls and text messages from people seeking help.

Over the past weeks mental health has been discussed sporadically during official briefings. The President himself has even suggested to expect a massive jump in mental health issues. “You’re going to have massive depression,” he said. “You’re going to have depression in the economy also. … [Expect] massive drug use, massive depression, mental depression, massive numbers of suicide.”

The President signed a $2 Trillion emergency relief package known as the CARES ACT that sets aside $425 million for SAMHSA to help address mental health and substance use disorders that may arise as a result of this crisis, another $100 million has been marked to supplement the federal grant programs, and the bill includes $250 million for Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics to increase access to mental health care services, as well as another $50 million for suicide prevention efforts, according to Health and Human Services.

According to the SAMHSA spokesperson they have been working closely with other agencies to address the growing mental health problems and to relax federal restrictions to make it easier for Americans to access the help that they need. But according to the official efforts thus far may still be insufficient to address what is believed will be happening in the weeks ahead, especially as the need for crisis counseling expands.

“Fear and anxiety about a disease can be overwhelming and cause strong emotions in adults and children,” SAMHSA noted on its website devoted to the coronavirus.

Many Americans are experiencing increased fear, stress, and anxiety about stay at home and shelter in place orders, social distancing, supply shortages, unemployment, being sick, as well as this being not only on a national but global scale, along with worries of increased restrictions. Homeland security officials are hoping that the already unstable Americans could be propelled to stress induced violence associated with the pandemic and restrictions.

According to SAMHSA there are currently 57.8 million Americans that are currently living with mental or substance use disorders. The Disaster Distress Helpline is fully operational 24 hours a day for all 7 days of the week, all year long. It is staffed to “provide counseling and support before, during, and after disasters, and refer people to local disaster-related resources for follow-up care and support,” according to the agency’s website.

28,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/melatonin-could-possibly-play-immune-modulating-role-against-covid-19/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-05-14,[],Melatonin Could Possibly Play An Immune Modulating Role Against COVID-19,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_222464605.jpg,"A recent review suggests that melatonin may play a role in combating COVID-19 as an adjuvant therapy; excessive inflammation, oxidation, and exaggerated immune responses during infection contributes to the cytokine storm that progresses into acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome and the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulating effects of melatonin have been shown to be protective against viral induced ALI and ARDS. (1)

Research indicates nucleotide similarity between SARS-COVs, MERS-CoVs and SARS-CoV02 which suggests a high genetic homology. With infection severe inflammatory and immune response may activate a cytokine storm such as apoptosis of epithelial cells and endothelial cells leading to vascular leakage and abnormal T-cell and macrophage responses that could induce ALI/ARDS and even death. This storm appears to be prevalent in those with COVID-19 based on genetic homology and pathologic features of infected lungs, and in the blood there is a marked increase of inflammatory markers IL-1B, IFN-y, IP-10, MCp-1, IL-4 and Il-10. Those with COVID-19 also present with suppressed immune function that is marked by hypo-albuminemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, and a decreased percentage of CD8+ T-cells. The excessive inflammation, depressed immunity, and cytokine storm appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of COVID-19. (1,2,3,6)

Due to the antiviral, antioxidant, and immune enhancing properties melatonin has been shown to help reduce viremia, paralysis, and death in mice infected with encephalitis and it has led to the downregulation of acute lung oxidative injury, proinflammatory cytokine release and inflammatory cell recruitment in respiratory syncytial virus models. Findings support possible use of melatonin in treatment of viral diseases, additionally the actions of melatonin support has potential attenuation for COVID-19 infection.(1,4,5)

The anti-inflammatory effects are exerted through various pathways such as suppressing NF-kB activation in ARDS and downregulating NF-kN activation in T-cells and lung tissues. It also stimulates NF-E3 related factor 2 which is important in protecting against lung, liver, and cardiovascular injury. Melatonin has been shown to help reduce production of the cytokines and chemokines TNF-a, IL-1B, IL-6, and IL-8 which are involved in inflammation. (1,9,10,11)

NLRP3 is part of the innate immune response during lung infection that is activated by viruses to amplify inflammation. It is correlated to lung disease caused by infection and melatonin has been shown to be efficacious at inhibiting NLRP3 mediated lung injury by reducing inflammation of macrophages and neutrophils in lung tissues. (1,7,8)

Melatonin enhances immune response by improving proliferation and maturation of natural killer cells, T and B lymphocytes, granulocytes and monocytes; in macrophages antigen presentation is augmented after the application of melatonin including the upregulation of complement receptor 3, MHC class I and class II, as well as CD4 antigens. (1,12)

Although there are no studies related to the use of melatonin in the treatment of COVID-19 its use has been shown to be promising in other diseases with increased levels of inflammation. Doses of 5 mg/d and 25 mg/d have been shown to decrease serum levels of IL-6, TBF-a, and hs-C reactive protein in those with diabetes mellitus and periodontitis, as well as promoting reductions in serum concentrations of TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1B and lipoproteins with MS. Melatonin intake of 5-10 mg/d has also been shown to decrease many of the same inflammatory cytokines that are being seen in COVID-19. (1,13,14,15)

Even at higher doses the short term use of melatonin has been deemed safe, but while their safety has been verified in human studies its effects when given to those with COVID-19 remains unknown and should be monitored closely.

Animal models and human studies have continuously documented the efficacy and safety of melatonin. Those with viral infection or those dealing with inflammation based chronic conditions possible may benefit from melatonin. Thus melatonin testing could reveal the baseline status of this anti-inflammatory and immune modulating hormone to provide a framework for its supplementation.",Low,,USA,0

Jeong Eun-kyeong, the director general of the Korean CDC said that rather than being reinfected it is possible that the virus may have been reactivated again in these people, given that they tested positive again so shortly after being released from quarantine.

“While we are putting more weight on reactivation as the possible cause, we are conducting a comprehensive study on this,” Jeong said. “There have been many cases when a patient during treatment will test negative one day and positive another.”

Currently in South Korea a patient may be deemed fully recovered after having negative results from two tests conducted within a 24 hour interval. The Korean CDC is conducting an epidemiological probe into the cases.

South Korea was among the countries to be earliest hit with a large scale outbreak, but has reported just 200 deaths and cases are beginning to fall since hitting what was believed to be the peak near the end of February 2020.

Korea has one of the world’s most expansive widespread testing programs and a technology driven approach to tracing infections that has helped the country to deal with the epidemic without having to lock down or shutdown businesses.

Korea is not the only country fearing re-infections in recovered patients as in China where the virus first emerged there are reports of recovered patients that have been released from the hospital testing positive again and some of them losing their struggle with the disease this time around.

Unfortunately there is very little understanding of why this may be happening, although there are some that believe that the problem may lie in faulty testing or inconsistencies in the test results. As epidemiologists around the globe race to find out more about COVID-19 now their work has another weed to deal with.

The rapid global spread has seen the focus shift to those who have contracted the virus but displaying few or atypical symptoms, and Korea is at the front lines and forefront of tracking these cases which is causing concern for China where they are reporting signs of the outbreak starting to come under control. If the virus is being reactivated in those who were deemed cured, this is not good news for anyone; but it is more likely that the virus hadn’t been fully cleared from the patient’s systems according to the Korean CDC.",Low,,USA,0

The stress, panic, and anxiety over the global pandemic has spawned an array of sleep disorders, from insomnia to irregular sleep patterns to sleeping more than normal. Add in schedule changes brought on by working from home, trying to home school children, and stay entertained while isolating at home, and sleep is quickly becoming yet another casualty of COVID-19, even among those who normally don’t struggle with sleep.

Unfortunately, the lifestyle changes that the pandemic response demands are leading many people to engage in behaviors that are counterproductive to their sleep. After all, when you don’t have to get up early for work or school, there’s no reason not to binge on “Tiger King” or the newest season of “Ozark.” Even if you aren’t getting caught up in a television series, it’s likely that your days aren’t following their typical rhythm. Instead of working from 8 to 5, you may be spending your evenings catching up on remote work and sleep takes a backseat.

The good news is that this pandemic won’t last forever. The bad news is that the longer we’re faced with shelter-in-place and stay-at-home orders, the more challenging it may be to return to normal routines. For that reason, it’s important to develop good habits for coping with stress and anxiety -- and that includes maintaining good sleep habits.

In fact, maintaining good sleep habits can even help you maintain immunity to illness. Studies show that people who don’t get enough sleep are more likely to get sick when exposed to a virus, so following these tips for managing your anxiety and getting sleep can help you weather this crisis and return to normal more successfully.

6 Ways to Sleep When You Have Coronavirus Anxiety

Maintain a Consistent Routine

As much as you can, try to maintain your typical sleep routine, going to bed and waking at your normal times. As tempting as it is to stay in bed, maintaining your regular patterns can help you retain a sense of normalcy that reduces stress, and ensures you maintain a healthy sleep cycle. Not to mention, when the restrictions are lifted, staying on your normal cycle ensures you won’t have to reestablish your old patterns later.

Keep Work Out of the Bedroom

One of the foundations of good sleep hygiene is to reserve the bedroom for sleep and sex only, and avoid working, watching television, or other activities. Avoid working in your bedroom (especially in bed) to keep work and sleep separate and avoid creating associations with stress that keep you awake.

Stay Active

You may not be able to keep up with your normal fitness routine right now, but that doesn’t mean you should turn into a couch potato. Staying active not only helps regulate your sleep cycle, it also releases feel-good brain chemicals that can help you better manage your anxiety and stress. Take a walk, have a family dance party, or tackle some yard work outdoors to burn off excess energy and get your mind off of the news for a while.

Turn Off the News

The news these days is often grim, and following the daily briefings, updates, and predictions can send even the most level-headed person into a tailspin of anxiety and panic. And it’s not just information overload that’s contributing to sleep disruption. When you spend hours glued to your devices looking for updates, the increased levels of blue light disrupt your body’s natural melatonin production, ultimately making it more difficult to sleep.

To keep your feelings under control while staying informed, set boundaries regarding news consumption. For example, consider only watching the news for updates in the early morning or dinner hour, and stick to broadcasts that focus on the headlines, not opinion or interpretation. Avoid consuming the news before bed, which can keep you awake.

Learn New Coping Strategies

Many of the common strategies we use to deal with stress, such as getting together with friends or shopping, are off-limits at this time. Use this time to develop new strategies, such as trying a new hobby like painting or jigsaw puzzles, or tackle that stack of books you’ve been meaning to read. You might even find hobbies that you will continue after the emergency ends.

Don’t Worry About Sleep

It sounds counterintuitive, but worrying about your sleep only makes it more difficult to sleep. When you’re anxious about sleep, it only creates more stress. If you’re having trouble sleeping, focus on maintaining your normal schedule and stress reduction, rather than forcing yourself to sleep. When you get into bed, don’t make sleep your goal, but rather relaxation. Again, limiting your news consumption before bed and making that time “me time” to relax with a warm bath or shower, some light stretching, and some light entertainment (like reading a book) can help you get into a good place to sleep.

Above all, remember that this crisis is temporary. It may seem endless right now, but eventually the emergency will pass and life will return to some semblance of normal. Keeping perspective, and doing everything you can to stay healthy will help you weather the storm.

Estimates of COVID-19 mortality and time until death were used in a recent study published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases to test the quality of official case records, findings show that countries have only discovered on average about 6% of infections, and the number of infections globally may well have already reached several tens of millions.

According to the report insufficient and delayed testing may explain why some countries are experiencing much higher casualty numbers relative to their reported confirmed cases such as Italy and Spain while Germany has detected as estimated 15.6% of infections compared to 3.5% in Italy and 1.7% in Spain. Detection rates are even lower in America at 1.6% and in the UK the rate is 1.2%, both of these two countries are receiving widespread criticism from global public health experts for their delayed response to the pandemic.

South Korea appears to have discovered about half of their infections. As of March 31, 2020 Germany had 460,000 infections, based on the same method the researchers calculated that America has over 10 million infections, Spain has over 5 million, Italy has more than 3 million, and the UK has more than 2 million cases of infection. These calculations came on the same day that Johns Hopkins University reported that globally there were less than 900,000 confirmed cases, which means that the overwhelming vast majority of infections are undetected.

Based on these findings international media outlets are parroting numbers from countries that are dramatically understating the true numbers of infection.

""These results mean that governments and policy-makers need to exercise extreme caution when interpreting case numbers for planning purposes. Such extreme differences in the amount and quality of testing carried out in different countries mean that official case records are largely uninformative and do not provide helpful information,” said Sebastian Vollmer, Professor of Development Economics at the University of Göttingen.

""Major improvements in the ability of countries to detect new infections and contain the virus are urgently needed,” adds Dr. Christian Bommer.",Low,,USA,0
32,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/diy-face-masks/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-04-06,[],DIY Face Masks,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_194622578.jpeg,"After weeks of saying that face masks aren’t needed for the general public, the CDC as well as others are now recommending that the general public wear face masks, in fact the Surgeon General has even offered instructions on how to make some at home given that supplies are long sold out and near impossible to find. ( links to videos at bottom of article)

“CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”

Some suggest that using blue shop towels as insert filters to make DIY face masks can improve filtering particles 2-3 times better than cotton after three clothing designers tested dozens of fabrics. The masks that are currently circulating the internet really are not geared towards professional, industrial production, but this is a case of something being better than nothing. Even the CDC has told healthcare workers unable to obtain proper PPE to use a bandanna or a scarf as a last resort.

This recommendation to medical professionals may be alarming as there is no evidence of homemade masks protecting against the virus. ""While wearing a scarf or bandana might help prevent a sick person from transmitting coronavirus infection to others by trapping respiratory droplets, it is unsafe for healthcare workers to rely on scarves and bandanas to protect themselves against infection by their patients,"" says Celine Gounder, an epidemiologist and clinical assistant professor of medicine and infectious diseases at New York University.

In the recommendation even the CDC acknowledges that homemade PPE for the face still is not considered to be PPE noting that ""their capability to protect [healthcare professionals] is unknown. Caution should be exercised when considering this option,” and adds that ideally a full face shield should be used in combination with homemade masks.

The National Nurses United professional association and union pushed back against the loosening of PPE standards against the CDC suggesting that surgical masks could be worn instead of the more specialized N95 masks: ""If nurses and health care workers aren't protected, that means patients and the public are not protected,"" NNU executive director Bonnie Castillo said in a press release. ""This is a major public health crisis of unknown proportions. Now is not the time to be weakening our standards and protections, or cutting corners. Now is the time we should be stepping up our efforts.""

Amid the shortages health organizations are partnering with private companies and donors to help make more crucial medical equipment available. Grounder suggests that such collaboration may be critical to bridging gaps in needed supplies during this trying time. ""We are at war against the coronavirus,"" she said. ""In prior wars, we asked families to donate their wedding rings, jewelry, and other items to the war effort. We should be pleading with the public and corporations who are hoarding respirator masks to donate their N95 masks to those serving on the frontlines of this war.""

For most homemade face masks are the only option. It has been suggested that by adding two blue shop towels to a face mask design that is tighter fitting homemade masks could block up to 95% of the particles tested, while cotton masks only blocked 20-60%. These masks are not meant to replace N95 masks, but as an alternative when proper PPE is not available.

Chloe Schempf, Lindsay Medoff and Heather Pavlu of Suay Sew Shop have dusted off their sewing machine and are making about 200,000 masks or as many as they can before they run out of supplies of these masks with blue shop towels they suggest are more effective to give to those people who are working in the front lines risking it all, as well as raising money to get them properly tested to see if their design can be validated as a safer solution to cotton during the mask shortage.

Not to contradict CDC recommendations for a cloth masks but, ""We spent a few days researching and brainstorming any material that could filter: coffee filters, batting, window shades, Swiffer, interfacing, etc., all the way to more technical materials that are available to specialized industrial sectors like aviation, oil refinery, medical fields,"" Schempf said.

They tested many materials to find materials that breath as easily as cotton but filtered better. HEPA bags for instance filter great but are too suffocating to wear(and they contain fiberglass). Inserting two stretchy blue shop towels made from polyester hydro knit into an ordinary cotton mask was found to bring the filtration capacity up to 93% of particles as small as 0.3 microns which is the smallest size their machines can test for; cotton masks alone filtered up to 60% in their best test, according to Schempf. They also suggest that the masks held the 95% filtration for 3 machine washes.

""This is by community, for community,"" Medoff said. ""This is ordinary people taking their power back.""

Health experts still say that masks such as these are not likely to protect a healthy person from getting the virus, but if those that are infected with the virus and are not aware of it happen to be wearing a homemade mask while following social distancing it could help to minimize the spread.

The Surgeon General, Dr. Jerome Adams, has even released a video showing people how to make their own cloth face covering in a few easy steps using an old T-shirt and rubber bands after the CDC announcement. Amid the shortage besides bandannas, scarves, towels, and bedding, people can make their own using items from around the house, he explains in the recently released video.

“Remember this is all about me protecting you and you protecting me. And if people voluntarily choose to wear a face covering they're wearing it to protect their neighbors from getting coronavirus because they could have asymptomatic spread,” said Dr. Adams.

Here videos showing how to make a face mask, please note these are not to replace proper protective equipment, rather when nothing else is available:

March 30, 2020

“If you can administer Vitamin C intravenously starting in the Emergency Room and every 6 hours thereafter, while in the hospital, the mortality rate of this disease and the need for mechanical ventilators will likely be greatly reduced,” says Dr. Pierre Kory, the Medical Director of the Trauma and Life Support Center and Chief of the Critical Care Service at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. He explains that it’s the inflammation sparked by the Coronavirus, not the virus itself, that kills patients. Inflammation causes a condition called Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which damages the lungs so that patients, suffering fever, fatigue, and the sense that their inner chest is on fire, eventually cannot breathe without the help of a ventilator.

The University of Wisconsin in Madison has included intravenous Vitamin C as part of its treatment guideline. It’s part of a combination therapy protocol developed in 2017 by Dr. Paul E. Marik at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk. Dr. Marik gives critically ill patients inexpensive, readily available intravenous doses of hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, and thiamine (“HAT” therapy) within 6 hours of entering an emergency room. In Dr. Marik’s study, published in 2017 in the journal “Chest” by the American College of Chest Physicians, his team reported that in the first 47 patients treated with HAT therapy the death rate was 8.5% compared to 40.4% in patients not treated with HAT. Further, in a recent study by Dr. Kory’s team involving a large series of patients suffering septic shock, including many with pneumonia, they found that early IV administration of these same vitamins and steroids was critical to survival. The risk of mortality increased with each 6 hours of delay.

When the Coronavirus pandemic hit China, Chinese doctors were quick to use intravenous Vitamin C. When their patients tested positive for COVID-19, the Chinese added 2 inexpensive, FDAapproved drugs hydroxychloroquine (anti-malarial) and zithromax (antibiotic) to the IV and gave patients oral doses of 2 supplements: melatonin and zinc. The combination likely worked given that their reported mortality rates are lower than reported elsewhere in the world The link to the Shanghai expert consensus on comprehensive care for COVID-19 patients is attached. The Chinese tried to do a clinical trial of IV Vitamin C, but Dr. Richard Z.Cheng, working with the investigators in Shanghai told Dr. Marik that it was very difficult to get patients to enter the trial. However, of the first 50 patients treated, no-one died!

When COVID-19 cases hit Virginia, Dr. Marik used his full HAT protocol (IV hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, thiamine) on ARDS patients in the ICU, while also adding the drugs and supplements used by the Chinese. The results have been remarkable. He recently saved four COVID-19 patients, including an 86-year old man with heart disease who was admitted to the hospital on 100% oxygen, by using the protocol. (86-year old men with heart disease do not normally survive COVID-19!)

Dr. Joseph Varon at United General Hospital in Houston, Texas, is using the protocol and, to date, has saved 16 lives. He reports that they are getting off the ventilator in 48 hours instead of 10 - 21 days! That means far fewer hospital beds and ventilators needed — as well as fewer coffins.

The big question is: Why aren’t many more U.S. hospitals adopting this protocol? “The only reason I can give is that there is widespread, and often well-founded, bias amongst physicians against the use of vitamin therapy,” says Dr. Kory. He adds, “The persistence of this bias is inexplicable given that the evidence is in plain sight.” He points out that despite the publication of a major study of intravenous Vitamin C in ARDS (the syndrome that is killing patients with COVID-19), which reported dramatic reductions in mortality, days on the ventilator, and days in the ICU, only a minority of critical care doctors adopted the therapy as part of routine practice.

One hospital chain disallowed the use of steroids in the treatment of COVID-19. That's because doctors are taught that steroids increase the growth of viruses and that steroids harm patients with influenza. Drs. Marik, Varon, and Kory all agree that, for this reason, steroids should not be given early to a patient with influenza or coronavirus. But Dr. Kory says evidence does not show harm of steroids in previous coronavirus epidemics such as SARS and MERS, especially when given late inthe disease. When the diagnosis is COVID-19, and especially when the inflammatory response begins to cause deterioration in breathing or the need for a ventilator, steroids should be added. Thesteroids are in the formula to fight the life-threatening inflammation. In fact, all of the formula’s ingredients are needed, together, to get maximum life-saving results.

New York Internist Dr. Keith Berkowitz adds that, “in this time of crisis, when ventilators are in limited supply, hospitals are overwhelmed with patients, and medical staff lack adequate protective gear and are putting their lives on the line, every hospital needs to try this safe, low-cost and highly effective treatment that leading specialists know saves lives in acute respiratory distress syndrome. This is not the time to wait months for a vaccine or years for more test results. The important thing now is to keep patients off ventilators and to save lives. Period.”",Low,,USA,0

In times like these, clear and effective guidance is a necessity. To assist clinicians with navigating this challenging landscape, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have released interim guidelines outlining preparation strategies for healthcare facilities anticipating community spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and those which may be experiencing it currently.

As the situation is unfolding dynamically it is impossible to predict the course of the outbreak and the medical workforce’s preparedness is vital to improving patient outcomes. The CDC stresses the importance of continual care for all patients, despite a surge in demand at healthcare facilities, and the need for concentrated efforts aimed at mobilizing all aspects of the system to reduce the spread of COVID-19 while decreasing its burden. As the situation continues to evolve, public health guidelines will likely change; clinicians and healthcare facilities should remain aware of the latest updates on local and state public health recommendations as they become available.

Preventative Actions to Take Now

At this time, the primary goals for the U.S. healthcare system are to reduce morbidity and mortality rates, minimize COVID-19 transmission, protect medical personnel, and preserve healthcare system functioning. To do so, the CDC recommends several preventative solutions to prepare healthcare facilities for potential outbreak spread.

In communities yet unaffected by the virus, the CDC urges healthcare facilities to take time to educate staff on COVID-19 preparations and protocols. This includes informing them about transmission mechanisms, the clinical management of COVID-19 patients, as well as infection prevention and control recommendations outlined by the agency.

Additionally, providers are urged to minimize the amount of face-to-face contact with patients by encouraging patients to use advice hotlines, patient portals, online assessment tools, and to call medical professionals directly. Implementing or expanding an existing telehealth program can prove vital at this time, helping clinicians provide safe and effective care remotely.

Personal protective equipment is lacking all over the country, however, providers should plan to optimize their facility’s supply before they reach a dire need. Identifying flexible mechanisms of procuring additional supplies when needed and organizing local drives for equipment donations can help prepare for future shortages.

It is also essential for healthcare facilities to prepare to safely triage and manage patients with COVID-19, which includes implementing visual alerts, instruction on hygiene and prevention etiquette, ensuring supplies are available, and offering facemasks to patients with respiratory symptoms. In addition, an area should be created to spatially separate patients with such symptoms, ideally allowing for at least 6 feet of space between individuals. It is also important to ensure patients with symptoms are aware of healthcare facility protocols – such as the need to call before arriving in person to allow care teams to prepare.

Handling COVID-19 Community Spread

In communities currently experiencing community spread of the virus, healthcare facilities are urged to work with local and state public health organizations, healthcare coalitions, and other local partners to minimize disease spread. Designated staff – trained on the CDCs’ infection prevention and control guidelines – should be responsible for caring for COVID-19 patients; these providers should also be monitored closely for symptoms.

Facilities experiencing widespread transmission may opt to screen staff members for fever or respiratory symptoms and prepare for increased absenteeism by extending hours, cross-training current employees, and hiring additional staff. Further, it is essential for staff to be aware of sick leave policies, recommended work restrictions, staff monitoring procedures, and be given the opportunity to stay home if they present symptoms of illness.

Medical professionals are encouraged to manage mild cases of COVID-19 remotely; if patients are able to engage in home monitoring safely, then telehealth is preferred. Caregivers and patients should be aware of home care instructions and be able to access the healthcare facilities for urgent care. Working with local public health authorities and community organizations can help affected communities offer support services for COVID-19 patients recovering at home – including food, medication, and other necessity delivery.

Considerations for Outpatient Care

The CDC urges facilities with outpatient services to reschedule non-urgent outpatient visits as necessary. Providers should consider reaching out to patients deemed at high risk of COVID-19 complications – including the elderly and those with underlying health conditions – to ensure they adhere to current treatment plans, confirm they have sufficient medication refills, and provide instructions on how to notify their providers if they begin to experience symptoms.

Additionally, it may be helpful to accelerate the timing of high priority screening and interventions in anticipation of an upcoming influx of COVID-19 patients. To support optimal hospital capacity, the CDC also recommends eliminating patient penalties for cancellations and missed appointments in cases of respiratory symptoms.

Considerations for Inpatient Care

Based on the latest guidance, facilities should reschedule elective surgeries as necessary at this time. When feasible, providers are urged to shift elective urgent inpatient diagnostic and surgical procedures to outpatient settings to further preserve hospital capacity. In planning for a forthcoming influx of COVID-19 patients, inpatient facilities should identify additional or alternate space in the ER, ICUs, and other patient care areas along with dedicated staff to care for known or suspected COVID-19 patients. Visitors of COVID-19 patients should be limited as well.

Considerations for Long Term Care Facilities

Long term care facilities are recommended to limit visitors, post visual alerts with hygiene instructions, ensure adequate supply availability, and employ targeted efforts toward preventing COVID-19 patients from exposing other patients. This can be achieved by limiting the movement of COVID-19 patients, designating staff members responsible for care of these patients, and observing incoming patients and staff for respiratory symptoms.

Although times are uncertain and it is not possible to determine if, how, and when the COVID-19 outbreak will affect your community, it is essential for healthcare providers and facilities across the nation to be prepared for potential emergency situations. These may include surges in incoming patients seeking care, potential staff shortages, closures related to social distancing, and a rising need for telehealth programs. Shifts in the healthcare model as a result of the outbreak are complex and expected to continue evolving as more information about the virus becomes available; clinicians are encouraged to communicate with their local public health officials to stay up to date with the latest guidance.",Low,,USA,0

Testing thus far has been designed to find fragments of the virus itself, this type of test uses PCR methods to find viral RNA in nasal samples and is useful for detecting those who are currently infected with the virus.

Current diagnostic tests aren’t helpful in identifying those who have recovered from the virus as they will no longer have detectable levels of viral RNA in their body, but recovered patients may have circulating antibodies in their blood. Widespread antibody testing may be useful for determining how many people were infected with the virus but are no longer and may have developed antibodies to help their immunity.

This new test was produced by the biotech Cellex under the emergency use authorization which allows for such testing to be used prior to gaining full approval, provided there are not any previously approved alternatives.

This test requires a blood sample which will be analyzed only in authorized labs, and it takes 15-20 minutes to provide results. It looks for immunoglobulin M and G antibodies; M is the first antibody that the body makes in response to a foreign substance and can appear for a few days after infection. G is produced in large quantities later in the infection process and is specific to COVID-19; positive results from this test could mean that the person is either infected or was recently infected according to the authorization letter.

Other companies were already making and distributing antibody tests without authorization, but those results could not be used to diagnose a past case of infection according to some reports. According to a report in Live Science other countries such as China have been conducting antibody tests for awhile. Blood tests and other tests looking for viral RNA if taken too early might miss cases according to that report.

Though such testing may be useful to determine whether a person has been infected and has developed antibodies, it is still not clear if those who have recovered gain immunity and how long they will remain immune, as some reports suggest that you can become infected more than once. More research is needed to determine immunity of those who have recovered.",Low,,USA,0

HCQ is an antimalarial that is also used to treat autoimmune diseases such as lupus.

Those that received hydroxychloroquine with standard treatment were observed to have had a significantly shorter time to body temperature recovery of about one day as well as a significantly reduced time to cough remission of about a day compared to patients receiving only the standard treatment according to reports from Zhan Zhang, MD of Wuhan University.

A larger proportion of patients in the group receiving the hydroxychloroquine with standard treatment had improved pneumonia compared to those in the control group, according to a manuscript posted on the medRxiv preprint server.

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been getting much attention lately, and the FDA is looking into conducting randomized trials against COVID-19, it is worth noting that some hospital have begun using a cocktail of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine to desperately ill patients on a compassionate care basis, and there are unconfirmed reports of some even using off label use of these agents.

Due to the attention the CDC has issued a warning to people against taking medications/remedies that they don’t understand as one unfortunate person died from ingesting chloroquine phosphate which is used to clean fish tanks, but thought it was the product getting all the attention in the media.

Previous trials exploring the in vivo activity of HCQ had found no benefit in clinical measures or viral clearance compared to standard care. The drug continues to be tested in trials including this randomized trial involving 62 hospitalized patients who were tested and confirmed to be infected with COVID-19. All patients received standard care including oxygen therapy, antiviral agents, antibacterial agents, and immunoglobulin with/without corticosteroids: those in the intervention groups also received 400 mg tablets of oral hydroxychloroquine sulfate per day on days 1-5.

Primary endpoint was time to clinical recovery which was defined as being the ""return to body temperature and cough relief, maintained for more than 72 [hours]."" The mean patient age was 45 and almost half were men, with no significant differences in the age and sex distribution between the groups according to the authors.

4 of the 62 patients in the control group were noted to progress to severe illness, and 2 patients reported having mild adverse reactions ( rash and headache) in the HCQ group. Those in the HCQ group had a one day shorter time to body temperature recovery and similar results were seen for time to cough remission.

Retinopathy is a known side effect from long term therapy with hydroxychloroquine which can often be seen in lupus patients who may remain on the drug for years. Those on long term use may also experience arrhythmias, gastrointestinal reactions, cramps, and liver dysfunction. Patients on hydroxychloroquine therapy should be monitored for adverse reactions, but according to Zhang and colleagues the ""short-term application of HCQ is relatively safe.""

The authors concluded that ""considering that there is no better option at present, it is a promising practice to apply HCQ to COVID-19 under reasonable management,” while also acknowledging there is still a need for large scale clinical trials and other research to clarify the treatment mechanisms and to optimize the treatment plan.

Back in 2010 a study published in PLoS Pathogens found ionic zinc was an inhibitor of coronavirus by preventing its replication and spread.

Zinc is essential for good health, it helps to metabolize nutrients, maintain the immune system, as well as growing and repairing body tissues. The body does not store zinc so it is important to meet the daily requirements: men 11 mg a day, women 8 mg but 11 while pregnant and 12 while breastfeeding.

In vitro cellular testing found that zinc was helpful in preventing a variety of RNA viruses which included poliovirus and influenza; somehow it interfered with the way the viruses process polyproteins which prevented them from doing damage.

Other research published in the British Medical Journal identified zinc as a possible treatment against SARS, which is also a type of coronavirus. Zinc ions were found to provide protection against this virus by preventing their attachment to cell surfaces.

“Over the past 30 years, researchers have demonstrated the critical role of zinc in diverse physiological processes, such as growth and development, maintenance and priming of the immune system, and tissue repair,” this authors explain.

“Direct antiviral effects of zinc ions have been demonstrated against rhinoviruses responsible for the common cold (1,2,3,4,5) … (and) [z]inc has also been shown to directly decrease the incidence of respiratory infections in young children from developing countries probably by mechanisms that involve restoration of T-cell immunity lost as a result of deficiency of this mineral.”

Incorporating zinc into your diet can be done through supplements, but the more natural approach is through diet as there are plenty of foods that contain high amounts of zinc.

Oysters contain about 16.6 milligrams of zinc per 100 grams

Hemp seed contain about 9.9 mg per 100 grams

Sesame seeds contain about 7.8 mg per 100 grams

Pumpkin seeds contain about 7.64 mg per 100 g

Cacao powder contains about 6-7 mg per 100 g

Grass fed beef contains about 5 mg of zinc per 100 grams

Alaskan crab contains 7.6 mg per 100 g

100 grams of legumes contain about 12% of the daily recommended value

Cashews contain about 15% of the DRV per one ounce serving

Cheddar cheese contains about 28% of the DRV per 100 grams

One cup of full fat milk contains about 9% of the DRV

Shrimp and mussels contain about 14% of teh DRV per 100 grams

One large egg contains about 5% of the DRV

One large regular or sweet potato contains 9% of the DRV for zinc

Green beans contain about 3% of the DRV per 100 grams

Dark chocolate contains about 3.3 mg or 30% of the DRV of zinc per 100 grams

If you are worried that you are not getting enough zinc speak to your physician or certified medical professional. Zinc is an essential mineral, eating enough is important to maintaining good health and the best way to do that is to ensure that you are eating a healthy diet with a variety of good choices such as seeds, nuts, and legumes.",Low,,USA,0

Simone, M.MS, M.D

DRUGS INCREASE ACE2 THAT IS NEEDED BY SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 Coronavirus) TO ATTACH AND INFECT CELLS of the lung, intestine, kidney, blood vessel. The more ACE2, the more infection. This may be the reason why the elderly who are treated with these drugs, have a greater risk of death / severe side effects.

A joint opinion statement about this topic was issued on March 17, 2020 by the American College Cardiology, American Heart Association, and the Heart Failure Society of America:

""The continued highest standard of care for cardiovascular disease patients diagnosed with COVID-19 is top priority, but there are no experimental or clinical data demonstrating beneficial or adverse outcomes among COVID-19 patients using ACE-I or ARB medications,"" said Richard J. Kovacs, MD, FACC. ""We urge urgent, additional research that can guide us to optimal care for the millions of people worldwide with cardiovascular disease and who may contract COVID-19. These recommendations will be adjusted as needed to correspond with the latest research.""

“In the event patients with cardiovascular disease are diagnosed with COVID-19, individualized treatment decisions should be made according to each patient's hemodynamic status and clinical presentation.""

Dr Simone's Recommendation March 18, 2020:

Speak with your prescribing physician about this to determine what is best for you.

We should always decrease risk while maintaining good blood pressure and diabetes control. Diabetes (34 million Americans) and certain medicines (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, ibuprofen, thiazolidinediones) taken by tens of millions of Americans increase the ACE2 receptors that allow the virus to attach and infect cells. Once these patients are infected, it may be too late. Therefore, physicians should consider modifying these medications or substituting them with calcium channel blockers or other diabetes medicines to maintain good blood pressure control and blood glucose control for a temporary period of time until the pandemic wanes.

I penned a prior report, extrapolating from published flu studies, which predicts that 6/10ths-to-1.3% serious side effects after mandated coronavirus vaccination among the nation’s 72.6 million senior adults would hospitalize 435,000-943,000 and a subsequent 1.4% mortality rate would then result in 54,202-111,493 deaths.

These hospitalizations and deaths are not necessarily caused by a vaccine, which is always pre-tested for safety among healthy adults who DO respond to vaccination by making antibodies, but from weak immunity among certain known risk groups.

Here are four ways the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic could have already been brought to a “dead stop.”

1. Coronaviruses produce seasonal disease, running 5 months from November to the end of March. This is the period when the earth tilts away from the sun in northern latitudes resulting in less vitamin D production in human skin combined with colder weather that causes people to bundle up in clothing, which makes things worse. And what do health authorities demand the public do? Stay indoors under quarantine and prolong the agony of this unprecedented pandemic.

If you haven’t noticed, quarantines don’t work. Look at the data from Italy (“All of Italy Is In Lockdown As Coronavirus Cases Rise” – CNN)

Americans must defy health authorities and go outside and bask in mid-day (10 AM to 2 PM) sunshine with skin exposed. Some of the news media ridicules individuals who ignore orders to stay indoors, inciting fear by reporting death counts that are only normal for the season and may not even be caused by coronavirus. ( NOTE: WHN is not recommending breaking any orders, and it is possible to stay inside and open a window/door to bask in the sun.)

Only a few infectious disease investigators have noted climatic conditions (cold temperature) drives people indoors (as do quarantines) that not only reduce vitamin D blood levels but also increase disease severity.

Coronaviruses are believed to be in circulation through the rest of the year but sunshine vitamin D keeps them from erupting. The man who is running the CDC, keeps pushing for prolongation of the quarantine/lockdown that is literally priming the disease. That same man said, before Congress, Covid-19 coronavirus is “10 times more lethal than seasonal flu.” But was quoted four days later in the New England Journal of Medicine to say “the case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1%….. and may be more akin to those of a severe seasonal influenza which has a case fatality rate of approximately 0.1%.”

Forcing people indoors increases transmission of seasonal viruses by 18.7 times compared to open-air environments. This information is contained in a report issued by the CDC itself [Emerging Infectious Diseases Vol. 26, June 2020]. Obviously, the left hand doesn’t know what the right hand is doing at the CDC.

While the world awaits a coronavirus vaccine, vitamin D is many times more effective than the flu vaccine. These discoveries have not been embraced by public health authorities.

There is also strong evidence that many virally-infected patients also have tuberculosis, particularly in foreign-born immigrants. TB is also a seasonal lung infection, like cold and flu viruses (i.e. coronavirus). Vitamin D is a known antidote for TB.

Given that coronavirus infection threatens high-risk individuals, a more targeted vitamin D supplementation campaign among diabetics, obese individuals, tobacco smokers and alcohol imbibers would likely serve to reduce cases of infection as well as subsequent hospitalizations and deaths.

It would cost society far less to target high-risk groups with the provision of vitamin D supplements and even sun lamp therapy than it would to vaccinate masses of people who will never be infected or hospitalized.

Pharmacies seeing patients who fit high-risk criteria could hand out free bottles of vitamin D provided by the government or at least recommend vitamin D to every patient.

Vaccines aren’t reliable prevention for high-risk individuals who don’t efficiently produce antibodies. Vitamin D therapy would represent true prevention. The Centers for Disease Control purchases vaccines from pharmaceutical manufacturers and could do the same for vitamin D. Of course, this would be anathema to physicians. Dispensing from pharmacies would likely be more do-able.

Influenza costs ~$10.4 billion a year for hospitalizations, doctor visits, vaccines and medicines. The provision of vitamin D pills during the 5 months of the cold and flu season for the nation’s 12 million senior adults aged 80+, considered the highest risk group, would cost just ~$200 million and would likely prevent billions of dollars of disease and death.

2. According to various reports, about 2-in-10 to 3-in-10 of coronavirus cases occur among health care and hospital personnel. The Centers for Disease Control does recommend healthcare personnel be provided respirators or masks. But after many years of drafting plans to fight seasonal flu outbreaks and epidemics, the CDC was caught unprepared. Masks and respirators are in short supply. What is needed are N-95 (0.3-micron filter) respirators, which are not available.

An alternative would be to use N95 respirators and N95 masks intended for industrial purposes, which are available, and adapt them for medical use.

Here the nation is 3 months into its battle against seasonal flu and COVID-19 coronavirus, and it is just now figuring out how to supply n95 masks and respirators to healthcare personnel. Be aware, some studies show N95 respirators compared to N95 masks reduce illness from 17% to just 6.2%. However, this was for transmission of bacteria, not viruses like coronavirus. However, as stated by Dr. Lawrence Broxmeyer, a great deal of the infectious lung disease now being treated is caused by a bacterium – tuberculosis.

If the public health agencies and hospitals can’t provide ambulance paramedics, nurses and ancillary health personnel proper protection, maybe we need crowdfunding by the public to buy them N95 respirators, so in case we do have to go to the hospital, we don’t have the disease transmitted from doctor/nurse to patient.

3. The lack of any approved drug or vaccine for coronavirus has prompted the search for natural non-prescription remedies. The trace mineral zinc is one of the natural remedies that have been revealed in this coronavirus pandemic as an antidote to coronavirus infection.

It has been demonstrated that the trace mineral zinc inhibits the replication of coronavirus in infected cells via its ability to block RNA synthesis. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses.

Drugs that improve zinc utilization and facilitate zinc entry in cells, such as chloroquine, have now become well known for their ability to quell coronavirus infections. To prove the underlying mechanism that makes this drug work, chelation (removal) of zinc reverses this effect.

The President of the United States declared chloroquine, used to treat malaria, a “godsend,” which was quickly pounced upon by political opponents and given widespread news coverage. But the FDA just now issued emergency approval of chloroquine for coronavirus.

Quercetin, an extract from red apples, and EGCG from green tea are also zinc ionophores (binders) like chloroquine.

Few physicians realize that unbound (free) bioavailable zinc is kept at a low level by binding to its carrier (metallothionein). The trace mineral selenium induces release of zinc from its binder, facilitating more bioavailable zinc.

If the public catches on, zinc could replace vaccines.

4. Diligent physicians who treat volumes of patients can accelerate research as there is no time to wait for results from clinical trials. There is no time for peer review. To avoid needless deaths, real-time work-in-progress studies can fast-track clinical data needed by medical personnel worldwide.

One such example is that of Vladimir Zelenko in New York who reports an unusually high coronavirus infection rate of 65% among the first 200 patients tested. The successful use of the therapeutic triad of an antibiotic (azithromycin), an autoimmune drug (hydroxychloroquine) and zinc sulfate among 699 infected patients has resulted in zero deaths, zero need for respirators with just 4 patients admitted to the hospital; in other words, zero death rate. Of note, both azithromycin and chloroquine are used to treat tuberculosis.

Notice the central role zinc is playing in the prevention and treatment of coronavirus. Zinc has only come out of the closet as a last resort. Yet it has been available for decades. Studies involving zinc lozenges have produced mixed results, but it has been noted that only zinc acetate lozenges that deliver a given amount of zinc have been found effective. Most zinc lozenges on the market do not deliver sufficient dosage to quell a viral infection. About 75-92 milligrams a day has been shown to be effective when given in a slow-release lozenge.

It is difficult to come to any other conclusion than that public health agencies aren't exactly operating in the public’s best interest. In fact, either by issuance of bad policies and health edicts or neglect of less problematic and more economical remedies, Americans can’t rely on public health agencies for the best advice on how to avoid or treat coronavirus infections.

Given that the news media parrots health policies to the public without question says Americans are being delivered nothing but high-end propaganda and need to obtain health information from other sources. Don’t listen to politicians who complain about a lack of hospital ventilators. According to one emergency room physician, 70-90% of virally infected patients with pneumonia that are placed on ventilators die. Ventilators are a last-ditch effort to buy time and hope for a cure. Americans will have to cure the coronavirus epidemic on their own.

Fear will be played to the hilt now to coerce the population into forced vaccination and 100% monitoring of our whereabouts, which was the objective of the plannedemic from the beginning. Because fear trumps information and logic.",Low,,USA,0

With a focus on affording the population widespread access to care, many regulations have recently been amended in order to assist the health care system in combating the spread of COVID-19. During an infectious disease outbreak or other emergency situation, it is important for clinicians to continue adhering to official mandates despite the national emergency.

As such, the Office for Civil Rights at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has recently shared an updated bulletin reminding health care providers of the ways in which patient information can be shared under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule. As per the HIPAA rule, the notice recognizes the need for public health officials to have access to protected medical information as a method of protecting the health and safety of both individual patients and the public at large. As such, it permits covered entities to disclose protected health information without authorization when mandated necessary.

Guidelines for Sharing Patient Information

The HIPAA Privacy Rule is intended to protect the privacy of patients’ health information, with exceptions made for appropriate disclosures of information when necessary to treat a patient, protect the nation’s public health, and for other critical purposes. In the case of a global pandemic, such disclosures may be warranted more frequently as public health organizations and government officials rely on patient health information to inform their directives.

Serving as a reminder of the protections of the Privacy Rule which are not set aside during an emergency, the latest bulletin provides essential guidance for health care providers. The latest HIPAA regulations are outlined below and can be found on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ website as well.

Treatment Information

Under the Privacy Rule, HIPAA-covered entities may disclose protected health information about a patient as necessary to treat both the patient and other patients without authorization. This includes the coordination and management of care as well as all other related services by one or more health care providers and others, consultation between providers, and the referral of patients for treatment.

Public Health Activities

The act recognizes the legitimate need for public health officials and others responsible for ensuring public health and safety have to access protected health information that is necessary to carry out their mission. Under the Privacy Rule, covered entities can disclose the needed health information without patient authorization to public health authorities, at the direction of a public health authority to foreign government agencies, and to persons deemed at risk.

Health care providers are permitted to disclose such information to a public health authority – an agency or authority of the United States government, a State or a territory responsible for public health – as well as an individual acting under a grant of authority from such an agency. This includes the CDC or a state or local health department authorized by law to collect or receive such information for the purpose of preventing or controlling disease, injury, or disability. Examples include the reporting of disease of injury and vital events (such as births or deaths) or conducting public health surveillance, investigations, or interventions.

Under these regulations, a covered entity may disclose to the CDC protected health information as needed to report all prior and prospective cases of patients exposed to or suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19. Furthermore, protected information may be disclosed to individuals deemed at risk of contracting or spreading the virus – if allowed for by state law – to notify persons as necessary and prevent the spread of disease.

Disclosures to Family Members and Others

According to the HIPAA Privacy Rule, a covered entity may share protected health information with a patient’s family members, relatives, friends, or other involved individuals. Information may also be shared to identify, locate, and notify anyone responsible for the patient’s care, as well as to convey the patient’s location, general condition, or death. Recipients of this information can include family members and other persons involved in the patient’s life, the police, the press, or the general public. Furthermore, a covered entity may share protected medical information with disaster relief organizations, such as the American Red Cross. However, the covered entity should receive verbal permission from patients when possible before disclosing such information.

Disclosures to Prevent Serious and Imminent Threat

Clinicians are permitted to share protected patient information with anyone to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the health and safety of a person or the public under applicable law and standards of ethical conduct. Providers may disclose information to anyone who is in a position to prevent or lessen imminent threat without prior permission. Although, in such cases, health care professionals are urged to use professional judgement and care in making determinations about the severity of imminent threat.

Disclosures to Media or Others Not Involved

Unless otherwise noted in the bulletin, clinicians cannot disclose information about an identifiable patient to the media or public at large without written authorization from the patient or their personal representative. However, covered entities may disclose limited medical information in cases of incapacitated patients. Additionally, information can be shared about patients who have not restricted the release of protected health information if this is done in the best interest of the patient or in response to a request to disclose information about a particular patient asked for by name.

Share “Minimum Necessary”

In the majority of cases, information disclosed should be kept at a “minimum necessary” although this does not apply to disclosures to health care providers for treatment purposes. Under the Privacy Rule, covered entities may rely on representations from public health officials to ensure the requested information is the minimum necessary. For example, covered entities may rely on CDC representations that protected health information requested by the CDC about all patients exposed to, suspected or confirmed to have COVID-19 is the minimum necessary for the public health purpose.

Safeguarding Patient Information

Medical professionals must prioritize safeguarding patient information; clinicians are responsible for protecting patient health information against intentional or unintentional impermissible uses and disclosures. Covered entities must apply the administrative, physical, and technical safeguards outlined under the HIPAA Security Rule to ensure the confidentiality of electronic medical data.

HIPAA-Covered Entities and Business Associates

Lastly, the HHS’ bulletin reminds clinicians of who the HIPAA Privacy Rule applies to. Currently, the Privacy Rule applies to disclosures made by employees, volunteers, and other members of a covered entity’s or its business associate’s workforce. This includes health plans, health care clearinghouses, as well as health care providers that conduct one or more covered health care transactions electronically. Under the rule, business associates are defined as individuals or entities that perform functions or activities on behalf of or provide services to a covered entity that involve the use of protected health information. These also include subcontractors working on behalf of other business associates.

As such, the Privacy Rule does not apply to disclosures made by entities or other persons who are not covered entities or business associates, such as third-party administrators.

Understanding and following HIPAA rules is crucial to navigating the increasingly complex clinical setting during the global COVID-19 pandemic. Health care professionals are urged to treat all medical information as confidential, affording it HIPAA protections to operate out of an abundance of caution. Disclosures of protected health information should be made only to authorized personnel and care should be taken to ensure patient data is not shared unintentionally.

Pulmonologist and critical care specialists Dr. Andrew G. Weber, who is affiliated with two Northwell Health facilities on Long Island, is reporting that his COVID-19 intensive care patients are immediately receiving 1,500 mgs of vitamin C intravenously and are re-administered the exact amounts 3-4 times per day.

Each dose is more than 16 times the national recommended guideline allowances of 90 mg for adult men and 75 mg for adult women. This approach is based on experimental treatments and small studies involving coronavirus patients in Shanghai, China; a hospital even made a release about it.

The official statement from Xi’an Jiaotong University Second Hospital reads:

“On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).”

“The patients who received vitamin C did significantly better than those who did not get vitamin C,” said Weber. “It helps a tremendous amount, but it is not highlighted because it’s not a sexy drug.”

Jason Molinet who is spokesperson for Northwell states that vitamin C is being “widely used” to treat COVID-19 patients throughout the system, but the treatment protocols vary from patient to patient “as the clinician decides.” Currently about 700 patients are being treated across the hospital network, but Molient was not sure exactly how many were getting vitamin C treatments.

The vitamin C treatments are being administered in addition to other medicines such as hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and various other biologicals and blood thinners, according to Weber. New York hospitals have been given federal permission to administer a cocktail of azithromycin and hydroxychloroquine to desperately ill patients on a compassionate care basis.

Vitamin C levels dramatically drop in those with COVID-19 when they experience sepsis, which is an inflammatory response that happens when the body overreacts to the infection. “It makes all the sense in the world to try and maintain this level of vitamin C,” says Weber.

Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan, China is conducting clinical trials on the effectiveness of high dose intravenous vitamin C on COVID-19 patients. One is a randomized triple blind study involving 140 COVID-19 patients, and it is expected to be complete by September, 30, 2020 based on information posted in the National Library of Medicine’s website.

The small French study published last week using the cocktail combination of hydroxychloroquine/Plaquenil and azithromycin/Zithromax showed that 5 out of 6 COVID-19 patients that were treated with the cocktail tested negative on day 3 and all tested negative on day 6. However, Dr. Anthony Fauci who is the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infection Diseases cautions that this cocktail has not been proven in clinical trials.",Low,,USA,0

“Demand continues to be much higher than supply,” CEO Severin Schwan said in an interview Monday with CNBC. “The good news is that, in addition over the last week, other companies have received approval for their respective tests. So we are glad that overall capacity is increasing.”

“But the reality is that broad-based testing is not yet possible,” Schwan said. “It’s really of utmost importance to prioritize testing—to focus testing where we can get the highest impact for patients and the healthcare system. That means we have to prioritize high-risk patients and patients with signs and symptoms of the disease.”

Roche was given the go ahead from the FDA within 24 hours of receiving the application, since that time the FDA has told commercial diagnostic developers they can proceed with their own validated tests and submit an Emergency Use Authorization application within 15 days afterwards.

The FDA has also granted Thermo Fisher, Hologic, LabCorp, Quidel, Abbot, DiaSorin, GenMark and Primerdesign emergency authorizations, as well as its first point of care COVID-19 test that was developed by Cepheid.

Even with this it will still take time to build up enough stock to support the widespread screening of all people suspected to be infected, even those who may be asymptomatic, in the ideal approach to help contain the further spread of COVID-19.

AlloVir has been investigating how to help those with weakened immune systems cope with viral pathogens, and have accumulated evidence of improvement in an approach that entails exposing donor T-cells to cytokines that are combined with viral fragments thereby equipping the immune cells to recognize and help eliminate certain pathogens. With the most advanced expression of this approach being Viralym-M T-cell Therapy which was designed to kill 6 viruses that commonly affect immunocompromised patients; the drug was moved into phase 2 in 2014 with enough data to encourage planning of a late phase program.

This same approach will be applied to SARS-CoV-2 specific T-cells with the goal to create an off the shelf therapy that is capable of targeting specific and similar viruses such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV as well as endemic coronaviruses. The plan is to position specific T-cells for use as monotherapy and incorporate the coronavirus into ALVR106, which is a preclinical asset geared towards community acquired respiratory viruses. Using this approach researchers hope to improve the outcomes for those who are immunocompromised and become exposed to SARS-CoV-2 and other viruses that could overwhelm their weakened immune systems.

A timeline has not been provided for this COVID-19 program, but the interest in coronaviruses other than SARS-CoV-2 could mean that such therapies may still be relevant even if they miss the window of opportunity for these treatments for the pathogen currently at hand. Other companies that re-purpose existing drugs may have more advanced assets, but it is worth noting that T-cell therapy may help to fill in gaps within the treatment landscape.

“Given the worldwide coronavirus pandemic and risks to immunocompromised patients now and in the future, we believe it is our responsibility to leverage our scientific expertise and allocate resources for an allogeneic, off-the-shelf, coronavirus-specific T-cell program,” said Ann Leen, Ph.D., AlloVir Co-Founder, Chief Scientific Officer, and Professor of Pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine. “Together with Baylor College of Medicine we have already advanced two highly innovative allogeneic, off-the-shelf, multi-virus specific T-cell investigational immunotherapies. We believe we can apply this same approach to develop a cell therapy to treat and prevent coronavirus infections and diseases in immunocompromised patients.”",Low,,USA,0

Scientists from the National Institutes of Health, CDC, UCLA, and Princeton Universities have discovered that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can remain stable for long periods of time on surfaces and in aerosols. Their results may help to provide needed clues to the stability of SARS-CoV-2 which causes COVID-19, and suggests that people may be acquiring the virus through the air as well as after touching contaminated surfaces; this study has been shared widely after the researchers placed it on a preprint server to rapidly share their data with other colleagues.

The environmental effects of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-Cov-1 which cause SARS were compared. SARS-CoV-1 is closely related to SARS-CoV-2, and regarding stability both behave similarly, but this fails to explain when COVID-19 has become a much larger outbreak.

This study mimics the virus after being deposited from an infected person to common everyday surfaces in a household or hospital setting through coughing or touching objects, investigating how long the virus remains infectious on these surfaces. The scientists observed that the 2 viruses have similar viability, and that those infected may be spreading the virus without recognizing prior to displaying symptoms making control measures less effective. The stability of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols and on surfaces is likely what is contributing to the transmission of the virus in any setting.

Their findings confirm the guidance issued from public health professionals for people to use precautions similar to those for influenza and other respiratory viruses to help prevent the further spread of SARS-CoV-2: avoid close contact with those who appear to be sick; avoid touching food, eyes, nose and mouth until your hands have been washed with soap and water; use a tissue to cover when you cough or sneeze and dispose of it into the trash; be sure to wash your hands frequently along with cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces such as handles, door knobs, steering wheels, elevator buttons, ATM machines, store card terminals, stair railings, and counter tops among others.

If anything has been shown by events over the past few months, American capabilities in this area are very lacking.

In February 200 test kits produced by the CDC were distributed to over 100 public health labs across the nation; each containing materials to test 300-400 patients and all labs received the same kits which were distributed to equal locales in all states

This decision was prelude to some chaos for the following weeks, in which the availability of the testing was completely out of sync with the number of testing that was and still is needed. South Dakota with few cases may have been getting quick results while areas such as New York, Seattle and San Francisco which were in the middle of serious outbreaks were not able to get enough tests and the information needed to protect the public and stem the curve of the outbreak.

It can’t be stressed enough how critical rapid testing is in the early stages of an outbreak, it allows healthcare workers and families to identify and focus on tracking those possibly exposed, isolating, and treating any who may be infected to attempt to limit and/or contain further spread.

Additionally, during the important early weeks free help from leading global viral experts was not only ignored but also declined by American officials at a time when it would have had the greatest impact to the watching world’s shock. During these weeks the virus took off, without testing that led to no proper tracking and no possibility of containment allowing the virus to spread unknown infecting thousands of people leading to nationwide social distancing and shut down and shelter in place orders. We are now just beginning to grapple within the failure from those early bungles, and it is likely to haunt all of America in the months to come.

The limited and small first shipment to Washington state arrived well after more than weeks weeks after officials announced the first cases of COVID-19 for example, and at that same time outbreaks had been festering in many places within it; as a result within a few mere weeks over three dozen infected would die at a nursing home in the suburbs of Seattle. From that point it did not take long from the virus to continue its rapid spread to overwhelm the state.

The administration has attempted to speed testing after so many missteps have further hampered responses to contain the virus, which has led to officials facing a barrage of criticism from global health experts, state officials, members of Congress, the American healthcare system, and the American public watching the continued bungles.

Federal officials have tried to ease the process for labs to perform their own testing, leading to university and commercial labs ramping up their capacity. Public and private labs are now estimated to be able to test more than 36,000 people a day, but this number can vary considerably and does not indicate how many tests are actually being given or are allowed to be given to patients.

“We are now beginning to see that they have spread out in a prioritized way. We asked them to prioritize the regions that were mostly affected,” Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator for the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said Wednesday of private labs’ testing, without elaboration.

But is this ramping up a case of too little too late after weeks of faltering attempts, ignored warnings, denied requests and thousands of undiagnosed people spreading the virus to others, who then go on to continue the unknown spread? Let’s be honest the virus has been here since January, spreading largely unknown, and if any one cares to continue to be honest about it we actually have no idea how many people are infected due to lack of testing, and limiting testing to those displaying multiple symptoms, where's according to WHO 80% of those infected will experience mild to no symptoms.

Then there is the faulty testing, for example on Feb.8, 2020 New York state received a faulty test kit for 800 specimens, this amount is also consistent with that of other states all contributing to lack of containment and further spread. Since then the state has begun testing based on CDC protocols and have tested 7,200 people statewide.

Middle states within American have had few reported outbreaks, and they appear to have the luxury of time to plan such as Missouri only using 395 of their 800 tests reporting 26 positive cases, and when private labs are accounted for that number increases to 47 confirmed cases.

Areas with less international travel to their regions will benefit from that lack. “This is very similar to 1918 with the influenza pandemic—St. Louis had more time to prepare and was able to put measures in place to flatten the curve than, say, Philadelphia,” Lawrence said. “Seattle didn’t have an opportunity to prepare as much in advance.”

As more commercial labs are becoming available, they are having their hands tied with strict restrictions that are limiting their testing capabilities nationwide. Due to the widespread lack of testing there is no way for tens of thousands of people to know if they have come into contact with a person who has been infected until well after it happens, if they find out at all.

“CDC will distribute tests based on where they can do the most good. But without hospital-based testing and commercial testing, it will not be possible to meet the need,” said Tom Frieden, who led the CDC during the Obama administration and is a former commissioner of the New York City Health Department.

California is one of the states currently being hit hard by the initial wave of COVID-19. Many there are being told that they don’t qualify for testing because they have not traveled abroad, or had contact with a confirmed infected person, and are not displaying multiple symptoms. There are many reasons as to why this is wrong, the most important being wide screening is a critical component in any attempt to contain the spread of any outbreak. Some areas weren’t even able to begin their limited restricted testing until March 2 due to issues with the initial faulty test kits.

“We are still limited on extraction kits,” Mandy Cohen, the Health and Human Services secretary in North Carolina, said in an interview in mid-March. Officials earlier this month could test only 300 patients because of shortages in the extraction materials needed to register whether the novel coronavirus is present.

Despite federal officials saying they are sending help/supplies and ramping up efforts, states are still waiting and have been told to purchase their own. In a recent press conference it was brought to the administration's attention that when states try to purchase supplies they are being outbid by federal purchase orders. This was met by snickering, denial and gas lighting comments which does not reflect positively or instill any confidence to the watching people looking for signs of hope.

In many states, testing rules are so strict community outbreaks are going unnoticed until it is too late to go along with the serious lack of test kits. The vast majority of Americans still cannot get tested due to the patchworks of rules governing who can be tested even if a doctor requests permission. Broad testing/screening is critical, that’s a fact.",Low,,USA,0

Additionally, lung conditions as shown in X-rays improved in 91% of those taking the drug as compared to 61% of those not taking the drug.

While not as effective in those with severe symptoms, according to Pharmaceutical Technology, Wuhan patients also have had positive results in shortening of duration with fever reduction from an average 4.2 days to 2.5 days.

""We've given Avigan to 70 to 80 people, but it doesn't seem to work that well when the virus has already multiplied,"" a source from the Japanese Health Ministry told the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper, according to The Guardian.

Favipiravir/Avigan is made to treat RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2 which are viruses with the main genetic material of RNA rather than DNA, by stopping replication via crippling RNA polymerase enzymes that build RNA. Without the enzyme being entact the virus is not able to duplicate its genetic materials once inside a host cell, according to the drug description published in the journal Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Ser. B, Physical and Biological Sciences.

Progressive Radio Network, March 10, 2020

In recent weeks, the coronavirus pandemic has dominated the news at the expense of everything else that is critical and urgent in our lives. As panic increases and more cases are reported daily, health-minded people are eager or even desperate to know whether there are ways to strengthen the body's immune system to offer some protection from this specific upper respiratory infection.

There are six known strains of coronavirus, four which are associated with the common cold or moderate respiratory infections. Everyone has likely had a coronavirus infection at some time in their lives. However, two strains -- Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) -- are much more severe. Between the years 2002-2004 and 2014-2018 these strains respectively were observed to be lethal. However, during this periods, total deaths were less than one thousand. SARS has the ability to infect the lower respiratory system as well. The current strain being called Cov19 is a new mutation that is being recognized as a novel SARS. As of this writing, the current coronvirus has been attributed to over 4,000 deaths, the large majority among the elderly. In a recent press conference the Surgeon General remarked that the average age of deaths was 80.

Compared to other viral infections that target the respiratory tract, especially influenza, there has been far less research either to understand the pathway of infection and the drugs or natural substances to battle the virus. It remains uncertain how long immunity, if any, lasts after infection. Seemingly, immunity wanes quickly. Consequently, since coronavirus is most often responsible for a flu-like common cold, recommended prevention and treatment protocols are largely similar to the flu.

During a recent coronavirus task force meeting, Trump asked whether the flu vaccine would protect against the coronavirus. The flu vaccine is not only influenza-specific, it is also flu strain specific. It offers absolutely no protection to any other viruses. Nevertheless we are going to likely witness a sharp rise in propaganda recommending flu vaccines to fight the coronavirus scare. The belief is that increasing national flu vaccination compliance will not only reduce the risks of flu infection but will also help divert money away from flu infections to better deal with the rising coronavirus cases.

But there is a caveat. A very serious caveat.

Sometimes the universe has an unusual way of providing warnings that we have an opportunity to either heed or disregard to our benefit or detriment. On December 31, 2019 in order to usher in the New Year, China reported the first case of an ""unusual pneumonia"" in its port city of Wuhan. A week later on January 7th, the pathogen was identified as a novel strain of coronavirus. That same month, the prestigious journal Vaccine, published a study conducted by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch at Wright Patterson Air Force Base. Researchers investigated viral interference due to receiving the flu shot; in other words, does the flu vaccine make a recipient more susceptible to other non-influenza respiratory viral infections? The study's conclusions state ""Vaccine derived virus interference was significantly associated with coronavirus and human metapneumovirus.""

This is not the first time that viral interference from the flu vaccine has been associated with an increase in non-influenza respiratory infections. A much more thorough study, an actual clinical trial, was conducted by the University of Hong Kong in 2012. The double blind randomized controlled trial followed a group of flu-vaccinated versus placebo-vaccinated children between 6 and 15 years of age over the course of nine months to determine infection rates from 19 other respiratory viruses. The study found ""no statistically significant difference in the risk of confirmed seasonal influence influenza infection between recipients of the [influenza vaccine] or placebo."" However, it was the dramatic number of incidences of non-influenza infections found in the flu-vaccinated group (105 cases), which included coronavirus, as opposed to 54 cases among those who received a placebo. In other words, the results suggest that receiving the flu shot may increase one's risk of contracting another infectious virus by almost 100 percent.

A recent analysis out of China reviewing rates of infection, targeted populations and mortality reported that the worst hit group is older people, particularly those who have immune-compromised conditions: cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, chronic respiratory illnesses, etc. Taking this statistic into account, we may note that the majority of American adults have some type of chronic condition. It is estimated that 60% of American adults have at least one underlying health condition and 40% have two or more. For example, 33 million have diabetes and an estimated 84 million are pre-diabetic; heart disease affects 121 million and there are approximately 1.7 million new cancer diagnoses annually. All of these people, therefore, have either a mild to severe compromised immune system.

A Swiss study noted that the SARS coronavirus and influenza share two of the same proteases in targeted cells -- TMPRSS2 and HAT. These are responsible for activating the spread of the virus at the point of infection and contribute to their pathogenesis in an infected cell. Therefore it may be partially conjecture on our part to suggest that natural supplements and botanical remedies that have been shown in the scientific literature to be effective against influenza may more or less effective against coronavirus as well. In fact, last month a study was released by Shengjing Hospital of China Medical University in the Journal of Medical Virology recommending that patients' nutritional status should be evaluated before any conventional treatment. - The hospital recommended a regimen that included Vitamins A, B, C, D, E, Omega-3, Selenium, Zinc, gammaglobulin A administered intravenously and Chinese traditional medicine

Therefore we have scoured the peer-reviewed literature on the National Institutes of Health's Library of Medicine database to identify compelling studies that may warrant vitamin, antioxidant, and botanical supplementation as a means to protect ourselves from coronavirus and other viral infections. These have been shown to either have strong antiviral properties in general or have known biomolecular effects to strengthen the immune system against microbial infection. We are not offering prescriptions. This is just a summary of some important scientific information for you to make better informed decisions for protecting yourself while the coronavirus wends its course.

BOTANICALS:

Astragulus

In Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), coronaviral infections belong to a specific epidemic disease category. Astragulus is not only a very popular plant used in TCM, but it is also one of the most researched and promising botanical plants shown to have antiviral properties. In both TCM and Ayruveda medicinal formulas astrugulus has been prescribed for centuries because of its effectiveness against infections and over-stressed respiratory conditions. Compounds, notably saponins, found in astragulus have been well researched and found to hinder influenza proliferation. The US Department of Agriculture's Avian Disease and Oncology Laboratory found it inhibits avian flu viruses.

Jinlin Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China conducted a study published in the journal Microbiological Pathology that concluded

""Astragulus exhibits antiviral properties that can treat infectious bronchitis caused by [avian] coronavirus""

In China, which has a large poultry industry, avian coronaviruses are a serious threat to chicken farmers. Chinese farmers will often use astragulus in feed to protect the birds from infection as well as pig feed to ward off porcine circovirus.

Two weeks ago, Beijing University of Chinese Medicine completed an analysis of previous research looking at the benefits of Chinese herbal formulas against the SARS coronavirus and H1N1 flu (swine flu). In 3 studies, among participants who took formulas against SARS, none contracted the illness. Nor did any contract H1N1 influenza in four additional studies. A primary ingredient in these formulas' was astragulus.

Earlier in February, researchers at Beijing Children's Hospital at the Capital Medical University provided a thorough overview of recommended diagnostic procedures and treatments for specific symptoms witnessed in the current Cov19 infections that included both allopathic and traditional Chinese medicine. In cases where there are signs of severe weakness and stress observed in the lungs and spleen, a formula called Liu Jun Zi is being prescribed, which includes astragulus and ginseng as two primary botanicals.

Last week, the prestigious journal Science published a review out of Yun-nan Academy of Agricultural Sciences in China that investigated the great disparities in infection and mortality rates between different provinces - Wuhan being the most severe. In the provinces with the lowest infection rates, there was between an 84% to 98% use of TCM formulas. Again, two of the main ingredients were Astragulus and Ginseng.

Licorice Root (Glycyrrhizin Acid)

In traditional medicine licorice root has been used to relieve and treat ulcers, sore throats, bronchitis, coughs, adrenal insufficiencies and allergic diseases. Ancient manuscripts from China, India and Greece all include licorice for treating respiratory tract infections and hepatitis. In China and Japan licorice's main antiviral compounds are known as glycyrrhizins (GL). For 20 years glycyrrhizins have been used intravenously to treat chronic hepatitis B and C infections with very rare side effects. It has also been shown to induce apoptosis in lymphoma cells and Karposi sarcoma related to herpesvirus. Therefore it was an unexpected surprise to discover that there is notable research on glycyrrihizin's effectiveness against coronavirus and in particular SARS.

Japan's National Institute of Infectious Disease reported GL's effectiveness against coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as Epstein Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus. After the deadly SARS outbreak in 2012, virologists at Frankfurt University Medical School investigated several antiviral compounds to treat patients admitted with SARS coronavirus infections. Of all the compounds tested, licorice's GL was the most effective. The scientists concluded that ""Our findings suggest that glycyrrhizin should be assessed for treatment of SARS.""

The above research was later replicated at Sun Yat Sen University in China and published in the Chinese journal Bing Du Xue Bao. The researchers identified several derivatives of glycyrrhizin as primary molecules with antiviral properties. In addition to being effective against the SARS coronavirus, they also found it may be effective against herpes, HIV, hepatitis and influenza.

Earlier in 2005, a team of scientists from Goethe University in Germany and the Russian Academy of Sciences had already identified the antiviral activity of GL against SARS coronavirus. The molecule showed a ten-fold increase in anti-SARS activity compared to other potential treatments tested. One conjugate of GL had a 70-fold increase. That study was published in the Journal of Medical Chemistry. During that same year, the Chinese Academy of Sciences screened over 200 botanical plants used in Traditional Chinese Medicine to find those with the strong potency SARS coronavirus. Four botanicals stood out. One of the four was licorice's glycyrrhizin

Extract of licorice root is the most effective and glycyrrhizin is also available as a separate botanical supplement.

Elderberry (Sambucus nigra)

Elderberry has become a popular supplement for relieving symptoms of the common cold and flu infections. It is found wild worldwide and is part of many of the world's indigenous pharmacopias. There are many species of elderberry; the species Sambucus nigra seemingly has been shown to have the most medicinal qualities. When purchasing Elderberry or Sambucus, it is recommended to note it is Sambucus nigra. It is better to use a prepared formula rather than try to make it on your own from fresh berries and flowers. Elderberries contain cyangenic glycosides that can be poisonous and cause nausea, vomiting, cramps, diarrhea and weakness.

Most research has focused on elderberry's therapeutic value against influenza.

Hadassah University Hospital in Israel found that elderberry was effective in vitro against 10 different influenza strains. Cytokine activity for IL-1, TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-8 all significantly increased thereby confirming its anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties.

Another Israeli study by Hebrew University in Jerusalem and published in the Journal of Internal Medical Research found that participants enrolled with existing flu like symptoms who took 15 ml of elderberry syrup 4 times a day recovered four days earlier than those on medications or a placebo.

Finally, a more recent 2019 study by the University of Sydney observed that certain compounds in elderberry inhibit the flu virus's entry and replication in human cells.

However, there is also research showing elderberry's positive impact on coronavirus infections.

In 2014, researchers at Emory University noted that elderberry extract inhibited coronavirus virility at the point of infection. The scientists hypothesized that elderberry rendered the virus non infectious.

One of the better studies came out of National Sun Yat Sen University and the China Medical University Hospital in Taiwan in 2019. The researchers used an ethanol extract of Sambucus stem (not the berry) and observed its potential against coronavirus strain NL63

It is important to remember that deaths being attributed to the coronavirus are more often than not complicated by secondary infections that are often bacterial such as pneumonia. In addition to its antiviral properties, elderberry is also effective against pathogenic bacteria. Under laboratory conditions at Justus Liebig University in Germany, elderberry was shown to be very effective against several bacteria that are responsible for pneumonia during flu-like infections, and against Influenza A and B viruses in particular

Echinacea

A systematic review of the existing research before 2011 by the University of British Columbia and published in the journal Pharmaceuticals, concluded:

""all strains of human and avian influenza viruses tested (including a Tamiflu-resistant strain), as well as herpes simplex virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinoviruses, were very sensitive to a standardized Echinacea purpurea preparation""

There are different species of Echinacea. The species Echinacea purpurea has been shown to be most effective and targets the most infectious pathogens. When purchasing echinacea, be certain it is the purpurea strain.

Echinicea does present limitations depending upon the severity of an infection. Once a cold caused by any one of the various cold viruses, including coronavirus, more deeply infects the bronchia and the lower lung, echinacea does not appear to be helpful. It is more effective with upper respiratory tract infections.

One of the largest placebo double blind studies on echinacea was conducted by Cardifff University in the UK. The study followed participants for four months and confirmed the safety of long term echinacea supplementation. It also observed a statistically significant decrease in cold episodes in the echinacea group.

There are no strong studies showing echinacea's effectiveness against coronavirus. Up until 2014, only one study looked at its bioactivities against coronavirus and that was a mouse model which required high doses of the plant extract.

In 2012, Griffith University in Australia undertook one notable double blind study to determine whether echinacea provided protection to air travelers. The study concluded:

""Supplementation with standardized Echinacea tablets, if taken before and during travel, may have preventive effects against the development of respiratory symptoms during travel involving long-haul flights.""

As a piece of consumer advice, a Cornell University study looked at the medicinal properties throughout different parts of the echinicea plant: leaves, stems, bark, roots, etc. The scientists noted that only echinacea extracts that contain the root showed significant antiviral properties. Echinacea appears to modify the clinical course of flu-like respiratory infection by acting upon IL-8, IL-10 and IFN cytokine activity beneficially.

Olive Leaf

Oleuropein (OLE) is the most important biomolecule in the olive tree that contributes to its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, anti-cancer, antimicrobial and antiviral activities and effects. One advantage of olive leaf is that it is highly bioavailable to the body's cells.

There are almost 10,000 studies in the National Institutes of Health literature database referring to OLE, olive leaf, and olive oil, most with respect to its strong antioxidant and anticancer properties. According to analysis conducted by the Regina Elena National Cancer Institute in Rome of the oleuropein content in different parts of the olive plant, extracts made from buds and flowers showed the greatest strength and potency.

Olive leaf has not been shown to be particularly effective against viral upper respiratory infections; however there is considerable evidence to support olive leaf's ability to strengthen the immune system against other infectious viral diseases in addition to possessing many anti-inflammatory qualities.

There are only a few studies showing olive leaf's effectiveness against respiratory viruses. One randomized trial performed by the University of Auckland in New Zealand suggests olive leaf can contribute to treating respiratory illnesses, including coronavirus. A 2001 study out of the University of Hong Kong identified 6 separate antiviral agents in olives that were effective against parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).

Olive leaf is also effective against bacterial pathogens. Most bacterial pneumonias are gram-positive. According to a joint study by Arab American University and the University of Central Florida College of Medicine, OLE worked best against gram-positive pathogens but gram-negative organisms appeared to be resistant to OLE (eg, E coli, Salmonellas, etc.).

But OLE does possess notable anti-viral properties. The current Cov19 pandemic appears to utilize the host cell's ACE2 receptor. This same receptor is also activated in HIV infections. This is one reason why patients infected with this new coronavirus strain are being prescribed HIV drugs. Therefore might olive leaf extract contribute to the treatment for this new coronavirus strain?

New York University biochemists identified olive leaf extract's anti-HIV activity to modulate the host cell gene expression due to HIV infection. In fact, olive leaf extracts reversed HIV-1 infections. This was published in Journal of Biochemical and Biophysical Research. The conclusions state, ""Treatment with OLE reverses many of these HIV-1 infection-associated changes."" Another joint study by NYU and Harvard Medical School concluded that OLE from olive leaf is ""a unique class of HIV-1 inhibitors"" and is ""effective against viral fusion and integration.""

Oregano Oil

Oregano possesses a compound called carvacrol that has been shown to be antiviral. Although it has been tested on several influenza and flu-like respiratory viruses, it does not appear to have been tested against coronavirus.

Soochow University in China and the University of Oklahoma published a study in the BMC Journal of Complementary and Alternative Medicine focusing on oregano's antiviral properties against influenza viruses. Although oregano did not kill the virus it nevertheless inhibited the virus' ability to translate proteins responsible for the viral binding to cells.

A University of Putra Malaysia meta-analysis of existing research of different plant essential oils reported oregano was strongest against the flu-like viruses adenovirus and coxsackie virus.

A 2010 randomized double blind study study published in Evidence Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine suggested oregano was beneficial as a throat spray and showed significant and immediate improvement of upper respiratory infectious ailments.

University of Arizona published a paper in the Journal of Applied Microbiology investigating oregano's antiviral properties when used as a sanitizer. The study focused on one flu-like virus, novovirus. If sprayed on surfaces, carvacrol will kill the virus within 15 minutes of exposure. The most recent research into Cov19's surface life -- living outside of animal host -- is 9 days.

Other Botanicals

Saikosaponins is an important family of compounds found in the Bupleurum plant, which has been shown to have possible anti-coronavirus properties.

Kaohsiung Medical University in Taiwan examined many of the derivatives of saikosaponins and observed it has very potent anti-coronaviral activity that interferes with the early stage of the virus' replication. Several companies offer Bupleurum online

University College Dublin and Sichuan Agricultural University conducted a systematic meta-review of the existing medical literature on Chinese herbs that may prevent and treat viral respiratory infections. Among the most promising herbs against SARS coronavirus were panax ginseng, glycyrrhizin from licorice, and Isatis tinctoria, commonly known as woad or Asp of Jerusalem. Isatis is also available online.

Houttuynia cordata also known as fish mint, rainbow plant, fish wort, bishop's weed is indigenous to Southeast Asia. This botanical directly inhibits coronavirus' protease and blocks the viral RNA polymerase activity. A study out of Tsinghua University in Beijing found it significantly reduces fevers, sore throat and coughs due to the SARS virus. Tinctures of this plant are available online.

SUPPLEMENTS:

Vitamin C

Unlike the US, most of the world, especially in Asia and continental Europe, recognizes Vitamin C as an important anti-viral agent. It is also a remarkable antioxidant shown to ward off infections. At this moment, China is conducting several clinical trials with intravenous Vitamin C to treat patients infected with the Cov19 strain. The city government of Shanghai is now actively treating patients with intravenous Vitamin C. A trial at Zhongnan Hospital in Wuhan is using 24,000 mg per day intravenously. The Wuhan study can be viewed on the US National Library of Medicine's website here: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04264533

Until recently, Vitamin C has not been tested against coronavirus. There was one study performed to see whether the vitamin protected chick embryo organs from infection by avian coronavirus -- a very common infection in fowl. That study showed the vitamin positively increased embryo resistance against the virus. Otherwise, Vitamin C has only been well studied against other viral infections, especially influenza.

Seoul National University College of Medicine concluded that Vitamin C is an essential factor for anti-viral immune responses at the early stage of Influenza A infection.

In 2017 the University of Helsinki reviewed 148 studies that indicated Vitamin C may alleviate or prevent infections caused by bacteria and viruses. The most extensive indication studied was the common cold. Among people who are physically active, Vitamin C was most beneficial. However, many studies relied on very low Vitamin C doses, which likely contributed to the minor benefits observed. Some of these were as low as 100 mg daily. In addition, the studies showed that colds' duration was frequently shorter and less severe among people with sufficient Vitamin C levels.

An early randomized double blind trial to investigate Vitamin C's ability to protect elderly hospitalized patients from acute respiratory infections was conducted at Hudderfield University in the UK. The study relied on a very low dose of 200 mg per day. Nevertheless, those who received the vitamin faired significantly better than those taking placebo.

Finally, there was another early controlled placebo study involving 715 students between the ages 18-32 taking 1000 mg four times daily. The test group had an 85% decrease in flu and cold symptoms compared to the control.

Vitamin D

Barely a week goes by without another study appearing in the peer-reviewed literature that looks at either Vitamin D's therapeutic characteristics or the risks of Vitamin D deficiency. A high number of otherwise healthy adults have been reported to have low levels of vitamin D, mostly at the end of the Winter season. Deficiency rates vary between 42% for the entire population to 82% for Black Americans and 63% for Latinos. People who are housebound, institutionalized and those who work night shifts are most likely to be vitamin D deficient. This includes many elderly people who receive limited exposure to sunlight.

It has been shown that Vitamin D deficiency is associated with an increase risk in autoimmunity illnesses and greater susceptibility to infection. It also boosts up the body's mucosal defenses which are critical for protecting ourselves from infectious respiratory viruses

Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital in conjunction with a global collaborative study to follow up on a Cochrane analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials involving 11,000 participants confirmed that vitamin D. taken daily or weekly significantly cut the risk of respiratory infections in half

Jikei University School of Medicine in Japan conducted a randomized double blind placebo trial to measure the rate that Vitamin D reduced seasonal influenza A. Almost twice as many participants in the placebo group came down with the flu compared to the Vitamin D group. The Japanese scientists also observed that people with a history of asthma were best protected.

For children, a Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia meta review identified 13 of 18 studies confirming that Vitamin D deficiency was associated with increased incidences of acute lower respiratory infection.

N-Acetyl Cysteine

Oxidative stress is a well known pathway for microbial infections such as viruses and bacterial pneumonia, especially in the lungs.

When the lungs are subject to serious oxidative stress, there is an increase in inflammatory cytokines, especially IL-1, IL-8 and Tumor necrosis factor or TNF. Each of these cytokines have been shown repeatedly in clinical research to play a role in different respiratory infections including influenza, coronavirus, echovirus, adenovirus, coxsackie virus and others. Therefore, certain antioxidants can alleviate lung damage due to oxidative stress.

N-acetyl cysteine is one of these extremely important antioxidants. It exhibits both direct and indirect antioxidant properties. The indirect benefit is that it increases the concentration of another important antioxidant, glutathione, in the lung cells.

There is no confirmatory evidence that NAC directly targets flu or flu-like viral infections; however it has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of clinical symptoms.

Johann Goethe University Department of Virology observed that NAC inhibits the replication of seasonal human influenza A viruses by decreasing several these pro-inflammatory molecules. The scientists recommend that NAC should be included as an additional treatment option in the case of an influenza A pandemic.

An Italian randomized placebo study conducted at the University of Genoa found that subjects who were already suspected of having contact with the H1N1 flu virus who were placed under NAC treatment had a 25% rate of experiencing symptoms compared to 79% in the placebo group.

Certain cytokines, especially tumor necrosis factor and IL-6, have been associated with the pathogenesis of influenza and can increase the risk of mortality. In a mouse study, Italian researchers at Zambon Research Center gave NAC to flu-infected mice with a significant decrease in mortality.

Colloidal Silver

Nanoparticle or colloidal silver has been studied extensively for its anti-bacterial properties but less so for infectious viruses. Most studies for silver's antiviral activities have focused on HIV-1, Hepatitis B, herpesvirus and respiratory syncytial virus or RSV.

In a 2005 issue of the Journal of Nanotechnology, the University of Texas and Mexico University observed that silver nanoparticles could kill HIV-1 within 3 hours, and they suspected that this may be true for many other viruses as well. However, this conclusion may be too premature and more research is necessary.

There are studies showing silver's efficacy against respiratory viruses. One large study by Japan's National Defense Medical College Research Institute, published in the Journal of Molecular Sciences, recommended that Japanese healthcare workers take nanosilver to protect them from viruses including coronavirus.

In 2010, the University of Naples measured silver nanoparticles' capabilities to reduce and prevent infection from the parainfluenza type 3 virus. The scientists hypothesized that the silver may block the virus' interaction with the cell. Then a joint study by Deakin University in Australia and Osaka University in Japan found that colloidal silver significantly protected cells from H3N2 flu infection and prevented viral growth in the lungs

Finally, colliodal or nanoparticle gold has also been shown to inhibit the flu virus' binding capaticity to a cell's plasma membrane. That research was carried out by Freie University in Germany.

Conclusion:

Yes, we should be concerned about the coronavirus' high infectious rate. At the moment, the primary solutions being sought to handle the crisis is to spend billions of dollars to develop an effective vaccine and an accurate diagnostic kit. Additionally, according to a study out of Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health, the incubation period is estimated at 5.1 days for being infected and capable of infecting others without displaying symptoms. But there is no mention in the medical community nor the mainstream media about what we can do to strengthen our immune system.

Yes, a high quality 99% barrier mask is important, especially if worn in a crowded environment. Repeated washing of our hands for a full minute with soap water. Rub surfaces with alcohol at home and work and allow it to sit for 30 seconds. Likewise, wipe down door handles and telephone receivers. Quarantining people who have been exposed is important until they test negative. Closing schools is prudent. And if a vaccine is eventually developed and shown to be safe and effective that is another recourse. However none of the above protects the immune system in the event of coming into contact with the virus. We believe that the recommended natural solutions shared above, since it is supported in the peer reviewed scientific literature, is something everyone can do. Besides, it is safe and not expensive. Therefore these natural solutions too should be considered as a viable and effective recourse to lessen this pandemic's fatal effects.",Low,,USA,0

Their puzzle game challenges scientists as well as students and the public alike to build a protein that can block the virus from infiltrating human cells. This puzzle game is on Foldit, which is a 12 year old website created by the university’s Center for Game Science that was designed to crowdsource contributions to important protein research from over 200,000 registered players.

According to the University the most promising ideas that are generated from the game will be tested and possibly be manufactured by UW’s Institute for Protein Design in Seattle.

COVID-19 is short for Coronavirus disease 2019, and it is spreading around the globe infecting thousands of people and accumulating an increasing death toll as it moves. The title of coronavirus is not limited to this single virus rather a class of viruses that includes the common cold as well as SARS that have crown shaped spikes of protein on top. However, the symptoms of COVID-19 are on a level far more serious than what is seen in cold sufferers.

Coronaviruses spread when the spike of proteins on their surface bind tightly to receptor proteins found on human cells, when this occurs the virus can infect human cells and replicate. 90% of the cases thus far appear to be confirmed in China according to a tracker created by Johns Hopkins University, although an increasing amount of cases are emerging in Europe and America.

“In recent weeks, researchers have determined the structure of the 2019 coronavirus spike protein and how it binds to human receptors,” according to the puzzle description. “If we can design a protein that binds to this coronavirus spike protein, it could be used to block the interaction with human cells and halt infection!”

To assist in containment efforts even the tech world is taking serious precautions to avoid further spread of the deadly virus as such the giants Google and Amazon are restricting employee travel; and big tech conferences including Facebook’s F8, the Mobile World Congress, and the Game Developers Conference have either been cancelled or postponed.

So for any that would like to contact or take a shot at playing the game and finding a cure the next time it is opened please feel free to click here and watch for the opening on Foldit to help design an antiviral protein against COVID-19, and good luck to you all.",Low,,USA,0
51,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/risk-factors-covid-19-related-death-identified/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-03-12,[],Risk Factors For COVID-19 Related Death Identified,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_175177369.jpeg,"Based on patients admitted to the hospital and confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 the key risk factors for death are: signs of sepsis, blood clotting issues, diabetes, heart disease, and advanced age, according to a new retrospective study published in The Lancet evaluating data record for 191 patients of which 54 did not survive and all patients had been admitted to one of 2 hospitals in the epicenter of Wuhan, China.

“Multivariable regression showed increasing odds of in-hospital death associated with older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and d-dimer greater than 1 μg/L on admission,” the study’s authors wrote; age range for survivors was 45-58; that for non-survivors was 63-76.

This study also provided new findings on viral shedding which indicate that the median duration of viral shedding was 20 days in survivors ranging from 8-37 days and that the virus was detectable up until death in the non-survivors.

Prolonged viral shedding suggests that patients may still be able to spread COVID-19, but it was noted that the duration of viral shedding is influenced by the severity of infection and of those in the study two thirds had severe or critical illness, and the estimated duration was limited by low frequency of respiratory specimen collection and lack of measurable genetic material detection in samples.

“The extended viral shedding noted in our study has important implications for guiding decisions around isolation precautions and antiviral treatment in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection,” explained co-lead author professor Bin Cao from the China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Capital Medical University, China. “However, we need to be clear that viral shedding time should not be confused with other self-isolation guidance for people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 but do not have symptoms, as this guidance is based on the incubation time of the virus.”

“We recommend that negative tests for COVID-19 should be required before patients are discharged from hospital. In severe influenza, delayed viral treatment extends how long the virus is shed, and together these factors put infected patients at risk of dying. Similarly, effective antiviral treatment may improve outcomes in COVID-19, although we did not observe shortening of viral shedding duration after antiviral treatment in our study.”

“Older age, showing signs of sepsis on admission, underlying diseases like high blood pressure and diabetes, and the prolonged use of noninvasive ventilation were important factors in the deaths of these patients. Poorer outcomes in older people may be due, in part, to the age-related weakening of the immune system and increased inflammation that could promote viral replication and more prolonged responses to inflammation, causing lasting damage to the heart, brain, and other organs,” said co-author Dr. Zhibo Liu from Jinyintan Hospital, China.

Median duration of fever was 12 days in survivors, while the cough can remain for a long time as 45% of the survivors still had a cough at discharge. Dyspnoea ceased after 13 days in survivors, but the shortness of breath lasted until death in non-survivors. Findings also describe the time of occurrence of different complications such as sepsis, acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, and secondary infection.

This analysis included patients aged 18+ who were laboratory confirmed to have been infected with COVID-19 and were admitted to either Jinyintan Hospital and Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital after December 29, 2019, who had been discharged or died by January 31, 2020; these 2 sites were the designated hospitals for transferring patients to with severe COVID-19 in Wuhan until February 1. 2020.

For this study clinical records, treatment data, lab results and demographic data was compared between survivors and nonsurvivors examining the clinical source of symptoms, viral shedding, and changes in lab results during hospitalization using mathematical modeling to examine risk factors associated with mortality.

Findings showed that on average patients were middle aged with a median age of 56 year; 62% were men, and 48% had underlying chronic conditions of which the most common was high blood pressure at 30% and diabetes at 19%. From illness onset to discharge the median duration was 22 days, the average duration until death was 18.5 days.

Those who did not survive were more likely to be older, and have a higher score on the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment indicating sepsis, and elevated blood levels of the d-dimer protein on hospital admission which is a marker for coagulation.

Lower lymphocyte white blood cell count, elevated levels of Interleukin 6 which is a biomarker for inflammation and chronic disease, and increased high sensitivity to troponin I concentration were more common in those with severe cases of COVID-19 infection.

Frequency of complications such as respiratory failure was 98% for nonsurvivors and 36% for survivors; sepsis was 100% for non survivors and 42% for survivors; and the secondary infections were 50% for nonsurvivors and only 1% in survivors.

It was noted that there were several limitations to the study including that it excluded patients who were still in hospitals as of January 31,202 as they had relatively more severe disease at an earlier stage, thus the number of deaths found by the study does not include any of those patients and may not reflect the true mortality of COVID-19.

Also it was pointed out that not all laboratory test were done on all patients, so their exact role in predicting in hospital deaths may be underestimated; and lack of effective antivirals, inadequate adherence to standard supportive therapy, and high doses of corticosteroids, as well as transfer of some patients late in illness may have contributed to poor outcomes in some of the patients.",Low,,USA,0
52,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/peddling-disinformation-covid-19/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-03-12,[],Peddling Disinformation on COVID-19,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_42773520.jpeg,"It appears as if fact checkers are becoming even more occupied as well as scientists and experts who are scrambling to correct incorrect statements which are naturally being amplified by partisan media, propagandists and some officials globally.

From the moment COVID-19 hit some of the global administrations have appeared to be determined to portray an alternate reality around this outbreak. Using some of the incorrect information that has been provided the COVID-19 is a disease caused by a virus that is no worse than the seasonal flu, and some of those responses claim that it this a hoax and media coverage of the virus is nothing more than a part of a political conspiracy.

Much of this messaging and narrative comes from tossed off tweets, impromptu public statements, and public announcements. In reality global health officials are raising growing concerns about the outbreak and efforts to play down COVID-19 which has officially been called a pandemic by W.H.O. To add to the play down efforts they are being greatly amplified by the multi-platform propaganda apparatus that are lobbying for (re)election ranging from administration communications, to keyboard commandos, meme warriors of the internet, prime time partisans, to campaigns running on places such as Facebook. Wherever it may be appearing the overarching false message is still the same: Pay no mind to the fake news and fear mongering about COVID-19 as it is lies and political hype, everything is fine.

Any who choose to open their eyes and actually look for themselves can see the overwhelming truth in plain sight. Actual trained scientists, experts, and fact checkers are desperately scrambling to try and correct misleading information. In America according to the CDC: NO the virus has not been contained, that is an impossible task, NO testing is not widely available to anyone who wants it. Most importantly this is not similar to the common cold or flu meaning most definitely NO people should not go to work or school if they are feeling ill.

But the misleading responses to the outbreak unfortunately seem to have resonated even in America as a Quinnipiac University poll released this week has found that only 35% of Republicans are concerned about the virus compared to 68% of the Democrats, and it couldn’t be at a worse time as this could help further the spread of COVID-19 rather than slow it’s spread to help containment efforts.

Global responses to this outbreak are also drawing some comparisons to that of the autocratic regimes in Iran and China where they tried to deny any issue and tightly control all information of detriment to the local population and watching world. What some administrations are showing is that they don’t need to force silence of actual experts, scientists, and researchers of W.H.O or even the CDC or the press to undermine politically inconvenient information about a public health crisis that is actually true and on a global scale, no they can simply step on a soap box and use a bullhorn to drown out anything true or not.

“Total containment isn’t in the cards, '' said Nancy Messonnier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “Given the nature of this virus and how it’s spreading, that would be impossible. Our goal is to slow this thing down… We are preparing as if this were the next pandemic.”

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, has been warning for months about the possibility of this virus spreading to America. Here is a 6 minute video of an interview where he talks about those who may be more vulnerable, the likely unknown spread, and the current lack of American diagnostic capability: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rel6TDmAnbE “We’re just seeing the tip of the iceberg.”

According to W.H.O the virus will cause a mild respiratory infection in about 80% of those infected, about half will have pneumonia and another 15% will develop severe illness with at least 5% needing critical care. W.H.O stresses that fundamental public health interventions can still help to limit the spread and drive down cases of transmission even in areas where it is spreading rapidly as the work from authorities in China, Singapore, and South Korea are showing.

“This is not just a public health crisis, it is a crisis that will touch every sector — so every sector and every individual must be involved in the fight,” says W.H.O Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus who said that this is the first coronavirus to reach pandemic levels and also said “we have never before seen a pandemic that can be controlled.”

“We cannot say this loudly enough or clearly enough or often enough: All countries can still change the course of this pandemic,” Tedros said Wednesday. 90% of the cumulative cases have been reported in 4 countries is evidence that the rest of the world still had time to prevent an explosion of cases with action.

Officials from W.H.O. stress that countries should be implementing a strategic combination of containment and mitigation measures that involves trying to detect and stop chains of transmission with isolation and quarantines as well as community level steps such as social distancing to limit the possibility of broad spread from unknown sources that may not be able to be traced or tracked. W.H.O is eminently dismissing questions that efforts such as this are too costly or resources intensive given what could happen if countries do not slow the spread of this disease.

“What we’re seeing is successful are the fundamentals of public health,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, who heads WHO’s emerging diseases and zoonoses unit. “By protecting themselves, they’re preventing the onward transmission, which may lead to another vulnerable person,” while no one is immune, those who are more vulnerable include older and younger populations and those with existing health issues such as diabetes and heart disease.

Mike Ryan, the head of the WHO’s emergency program admits that public health interventions will not stop the virus dead in its tracks but it will help to slow the spread and flatten the curve to avoid adding burden to an overwhelmed health system.

Tedros points to the lack of some countries in resources, capacity and resolve as their officials have been arguing for weeks that some are not moving quickly enough to prepare for an outbreak. While Tendros declined to criticize individual member states publicly, there was note of failures of some countries to trace contacts, communicate clearly, test widely, and failure to coordinate among agencies as well as between federal governments and states, etc.

“You know who you are,” Ryan said about the countries that were not responding adequately.

Research in the UK are offering about $4500 in exchange for two weeks in a secure London facility that has a TV, Playstation gaming, WiFi, and a private bathroom to those who volunteer to be infected.

24 human volunteers are being sought after to infect with coronavirus strains 229E and OC43, while they are similar to COVID-19 they only cause a mild respiratory illness. Once infected a research team will be collecting samples such as nasal and blood, and all dirty tissues will be collected by a trained medical staff to assess the viral load.

Those who volunteer to be human test subjects will be closely monitored 24/7 for symptoms, the researchers will control your diet, and you will be barred from exercising as well as having contact with the outside world along with being confined to your room for two weeks. Along with feeling pretty miserable you will probably be able to get a good gaming or movie binge going, but that’s about it.

In January 2020 a team of scientists wrote a paper that has since been retracted claiming that this coronavirus may have been genetically engineered to contain parts of the HIV genome, in the report they wrote: ""This uncanny similarity of novel inserts in the 2019- nCoV spike protein to HIV-1 gp120 and Gag is unlikely to be fortuitous in nature,"" in other words they are suggesting that it is unlikely to have occurred naturally.

Fast forward to more recently new research from Nankai University in which the team writes that this COV-19 has an HIV like mutation that allows it to rapidly enter the human body with an ACE2 receptor on a cell membrane:

“Other highly contagious viruses, including HIV and Ebola, target an enzyme called furin, which works as a protein activator in the human body. Many proteins are inactive or dormant when they are produced and have to be “cut” at specific points to activate their various functions.

When looking at the genome sequence of the new coronavirus, Professor Ruan Jishou and his team at Nankai University in Tianjin found a section of mutated genes that did not exist in Sars, but were similar to those found in HIV and Ebola,” writes -SCMP.

""This finding suggests that 2019-nCoV [the new coronavirus] may be significantly different from the Sars coronavirus in the infection pathway,"" reads the paper published this month on Chinaxiv.org - a platform used by the Chinese Academy of Sciences which releases research papers prior to peer-review. ""This virus may use the packing mechanisms of other viruses such as HIV,"" they added.

To help with the confusion this latest report claims that this coronavirus may contain a specific HIV like feature that makes it abundantly infectious which may be the result of a “bizarre mutation.” Since this report is not claiming that it was created to be an airborne version of HIV, rather a unexpected mutation they will most likely not have to retract it, even if the odds of such a bizarre and “random” mutation taking place naturally are extremely low.

According to the new report the mutation can generate a structure known as a cleavage site in the COVID-19’s spike protein, as compared to the SARS way of entry this binding method is 100 to 1000 times as efficient, according to the research team.

“The virus uses the outreaching spike protein to hook on to the host cell, but normally this protein is inactive. The cleavage site structure’s job is to cheat the human furin protein, so it will cut and activate the spike protein and cause a “direct fusion” of the viral and cellular membranes.” -SCMP

According to another paper published by Dr. Zhou Peng of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which is a follow up of a study from Huazhong University of Science and Technology:

“The mutation could not be found in Sars, Mers or Bat-CoVRaTG13, a bat coronavirus that was considered the original source of the new coronavirus with 96 percent similarity in genes” it said. This could be “the reason why SARS-CoV-2 is more infectious than other coronaviruses”, Li wrote in a paper released on Chinarxiv on Sunday.

French scientist Etienne Decroly at Aix-Marseille University, has published a study in the scientific journal Antiviral Research finding a “furin-like cleavage site” that is absent in similar coronaviruses.

Drugs targeting the furin enzyme are speculated to potentially hinder the virus replication inside of the host human body, and drugs for consideration include “a series of HIV-1 therapeutic drugs such as Indinavir, Tenofovir Alafenamide, Tenofovir Disoproxil and Dolutegravir and hepatitis C therapeutic drugs including Boceprevir and Telaprevir,"" according to Li's study.

This conclusion is inline with those of several reports from doctors who have self administered HIV drugs after they had tested positive for COVID-19, however it is worth noting that there have been no clinical tests conducted to either confirm or reject their theory.

The Chinese CDC at first didn’t consider this as a major threat, saying there was no evidence of human to human transmission, but this was invalidated quickly. There are suggestions that the link to furin may shed light on the evolution of the virus history that facilitated the jump to humans, as the “unexpected insertion” could come from coronavirus in rats or a species of avian flu, but more research is required to determine the cause of the bizarre mutation, all happening perfectly naturally, of course.

One important factoid not to overlook is that the ACE2 protein typically doesn’t exist in large quantities in healthy people.

So another question that comes to light from this is what is the risk for those who are taking ACE receptor inhibiting drugs such as those with hypertension? Are ACE drugs predisposing people with hypertension to the coronavirus? The American Heart Association estimates that there are 103 million American adults with high blood pressure alone and ACE inhibitors are the fourth most utilized drug class in America. Additionally, the older population is more prone to hypertension, and more likely to be taking ACE Rx. That could be a lot of people at an increased risk.",Low,,USA,0

March 4, 2020

The onslaught of misinformation from the corporatist wings of both political parties and media biases against universal healthcare are obviously confusing the electorate. This is seemingly evident in this week's Super Tuesday with Joe Biden winning the majority of the states. This confusion leaves citizens bewildered about how they will pay their bills unless a fundamental overhaul of medical insurance is undertaken. More importantly, what will happen when you are diagnosed with a serious illness and are not fully covered? What are your chances of joining the ranks of the 530,000 families that file bankruptcy annually for medical reasons?

According to a study published last year by the American Journal of Public Health, 66.5% of bankruptcies are medically-related. In the past, it was rare for people to go bankrupt because they did not have accessible medical care. There was a time in the US when medicine carried a higher standard of ethics. The Hippocratic Oath was respected and no one was denied medical care because they could not afford it. But that was in the past. Obama's Affordable Care Act, which Biden continues to believe is a successful piece of legislation, has done little to mitigate the increasing financial burden on individuals and families. In fact, the quality of healthcare has steadily declined.

Now with the threats of a coronavirus pandemic, we are learning that we may need to pay for diagnostic testing and very likely treatments. If you are returning to the country from overseas, you may be forced to pay for the time in quarantine even if you test negative for the virus. And it is certain that the pharmaceutical industry will attempt to capitalize on this pending disaster.

The Democrat Party's full throttle assault to undermine the legitimacy of Bernie Sanders' campaign is being orchestrated by the insurance and medical industrial complex, which has bought unbridled biased coverage across the media waves. The goal is to effectively sustain Obama's failed healthcare efforts. After listening to dozens of commentators on CNN, MSNBC, Fox, and the pseudo-health journalists at the New York Times, one would think that Bernie is only offering free stuff to everyone and at enormous cost to taxpayers. Therefore to remove Medicare for All from the national dialogue before the November presidential election, the neoliberal forces are uniting behind Biden.

No one truly knows how much a national universal program would cost. Forecasts for a 10-year period range roughly between $13 trillion and $48 trillion. One thing is certain. The math is simple. It would be extremely expensive and for it to succeed dramatic infrastructural changes would need to be made throughout the entire system. That conversation is long overdue.

However, perhaps this is the wrong argument because it is based upon the Democratic Party's deep seated cognitive dissonance to protect the vested interests of Wall Street's financial community, Biden's allegiance to the credit industry, the military industrial complex, and the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. In effect, the entirety of corporate America and the deep state, its lobbyists and oligarchic billionaires, and their sounding board in the mainstream media, are on one side of the scale while the urgent humanitarian medical needs of average citizens are on the other. All that weighs on the side of Bernie are the educated adults, unionists, working people, and those who understand climate change and the need for a comprehensive and equitable healthcare system. And after Super Tuesday's disturbing results, it might not look good for the revolution that must take place across the nation.

In part, it may be Sanders' campaign's miscasting the argument that has failed to win over moderate Democrats. Therefore what do we need?

First, Medicare for All is doable and affordable. In fact, it can potentially save $1.7 trillion a year by removing from the equation unnecessary and unconscionable profit to private insurance providers and the large mega-hospital networks. There is no reason for having so many levels of bureaucracy between direct medical care and the patient. Every industry directly involved in providing treatment and care would continue to profit. But it would be a reasonable profit. Instead we have a medical industry that is excessively greedy and eager to take advantage of loopholes in order to milk the system for whatever it is worth.

The problem is that we can have Medicare for All only after we seriously look at what it costs to treat a patient and make efforts to reduce the exorbitant waste that has been programmed into our current system. How is it that a hospital can charge $787 for an adult and $393 for a child for a one dollar bag of intravenous saline solution, plus an additional $127 to administer it? Americans spend more on prescription medications than any other developed nation, as drug prices can soar ten times the rate of inflation. Daraprim, for example, which is prescribed to fight one of the world's most common parasitical infections that causes toxoplasmosis, can cost $45,000 per month, or $750 for a single pill that costs $13.50 to manufacture.

Based upon earlier figures between 2012-2015, about $2.6 trillion can be saved by removing bureaucratic waste. This includes $275 billion on private insurance paperwork, $55.6 billion on liability, $471 billion for insurance billing, $140 billion for medical fraud (2016), $210 billion for unnecessary medical testing, and $190 billion for wasteful administrative services. Back in 2016, the British Medical Journal reported that medical error is the third leading cause of death in the US. As a result over $1 trillion is spent on avoidable medical errors.

Universal healthcare will not break the economy. What is breaking the economy is our current broken medical system. Universal, quality care is easily within reach but only after the health of the population is given preference over the healthcare system's vulture capitalism. Then Americans will no longer have to worry about bankruptcy, which further contributes to the stresses associated with ill health, because they cannot afford the treatments or medications without putting themselves and their family into perpetual debt.

Second, providing universal healthcare does not guarantee that patients will receive quality care. If we are truly honest with ourselves and ask whether the US has the best medical care available, the answer should be a resounding no. American emergency medicine is exemplary. However, chronic care for treating heart disease, cancer, diabetes, pain management and neurological conditions has been a dismal failure. More physicians need to be brought into the system without the anxiety of paying off enormous school debt and being forced to work to exhaustion. Bernie would be wise to make medical education free in return for young doctors committing themselves to charging reasonable fees if they wish to remain within the system. If a doctor prefers to gouge patients, that is their right to do outside of the national system.

Finally, the US lags far behind in implementing a national preventative program. Very little is being done to prevent diseases shown to be directly related to life-style, diet and toxic conditions in our environment. A viable prevention program would begin by supporting and mandating holistic health programs in our schools beginning with grade school. Why does offering school courses in ""How to be Healthy"" seem absurd when it has been shown repeatedly in the scientific literature and efforts in other advanced nations to avoid preventable illnesses and further reduce avoidable medical costs? But in order to launch a comprehensive preventative program at a national scale, only respected educated health consumers should be in charge. Entities representing private corporate interests should be prohibited since they are responsible for the medical disasters that now demand for universal healthcare. If Obamacare and the current corporate medical establishment were truly effective, there would be no discussion about Medicare for All.

Yes, universal healthcare will be expensive and cost trillions. But how many trillions will it save when all else is considered for how many lives will be saved and how healthier the nation would be if comprehensive measures were taken to prevent disease in the first place.",Low,,USA,0
56,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/official-statement-china-recommended-treatment-covid-19/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-03-05,[],Official Statement From China For Recommended Treatment Of COVID-19 Using Vitamin C,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_215688622.jpeg,"Confirming the reports from small independent studies and 3 clinical trials, a Shanghai hospital has announced a recommendation to use high dose intravenous treatment of vitamin C to treat COVID-19, according to the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service.

The announced official recommendation that COVID-19 should be treated with high doses of intravenous vitamin C come as welcomed news as the virus continues to spread. The dosage recommendation will vary with the severity of illness ranging from 50-200 milligrams per kilogram body weight per day to as much as 16,000 mg/kg/day.

*Note: ""Using Vitamin C"" was added to the title on April, 13, 2020.

The doses are ranging from approximately 4,000 to 16,000 mgs for an adult which is administered by an IV. Atsuo Yanagisawa, MD, PhD who is President of the Japanese College of Intravenous Therapy states that this specific method of administration is very important because vitamin C’s effects are at least 10 times more powerful when taken by IV rather than orally, and that “Intravenous vitamin C is a safe, effective, and broad-spectrum antiviral.”

Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD is the associate director for the clinical trials. We are proud to say that Dr. Cheng is a Fellow and board certified anti-aging physician by the American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M) as well as being a Fellow and board certified A4M Integrative Cancer Therapy. Dr. Cheng has been working closely with medical and government authorities through China and has been instrumental in facilitating at least 3 of the clinical IV vitamin C studies in China. Despite most of his work being sensored and blocked by most media Dr. Cheng has been trying to bring this information to the public and will continue his efforts to encourage more hospitals to implement IV vitamin C therapy along with high doses of oral vitamin C as well. Additionally, both Dr. Cheng and Dr. Yanagisawa recommend oral vitamin C for prevention of COVID-19.

Comments from Dr. Cheng in February reads:

“Vitamin C is very promising for prevention, and especially important to treat dying patients when there is no better treatment. Over 2,000 people have died of the COIV-19 outbreak and yet I have not seen or heard large dose intravenous vitamin C being used in any of the cases. The current sole focus on vaccine and specific antiviral drugs for epidemics is misplaced.”

“Early and sufficiently large doses of intravenous vitamin C are critical. Vitamin C is not only a prototypical antioxidant, but also involved in virus killing and prevention of viral replication. The significance of large dose intravenous vitamin C is not just at antiviral level. It is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) that kills most people from coronaviral pandemics (SARS, MERS and now NCP). ARDS is a common final pathway leading to death.

The official statement from Xi’an Jiaotong University Second Hospital reads:

“On the afternoon of February 20, 2020, another 4 patients with severe new coronaviral pneumonia recovered from the C10 West Ward of Tongji Hospital. In the past 8 patients have been discharged from hospital. . . [H]igh-dose vitamin C achieved good results in clinical applications. We believe that for patients with severe neonatal pneumonia and critically ill patients, vitamin C treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after admission. . .[E]arly application of large doses of vitamin C can have a strong antioxidant effect, reduce inflammatory responses, and improve endothelial function. . . Numerous studies have shown that the dose of vitamin C has a lot to do with the effect of treatment. . . [H]gh-dose vitamin C can not only improve antiviral levels, but more importantly, can prevent and treat acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress (ARDS).”

The protocol from the Chinese government can be read here, they are not blocking this news.

Then why are we not hearing more about this on the news when you can find it published online in many places, it does make one wonder. But this can be corrected at any time by people sharing the news, we have included various links that will take you to the information including the clinical trials.

To be blunt not sharing or withholding information from the public of potential treatments should be seen as negligence. Vitamin C is not new, it is available, and has been proven and used as an antiviral since the 1930s(1). Vitamin C has been injected at high doses since the 1940s(2), and has been used for influenza, SARS, and viral pneumonia in the decades since then(3).

“At my hospital in Daegu, South Korea, all inpatients and all staff members have been using vitamin C orally since last week. Some people this week had a mild fever, headaches and coughs, and those who had symptoms got 30,000 mg intravenous vitamin C. Some people got better after about two days, and most had symptoms go away after one injection.” (Hyoungjoo Shin, M.D.)

“We need to broadcast a message worldwide very quickly: Vitamin C (small or large dose) does no harm to people and is the one of the few, if not the only, agent that has a chance to prevent us from getting, and can treat, COVID-19 infection. When can we, medical doctors and scientists, put patients’ lives first?” (Richard Z. Cheng, MD, PhD, International Vitamin C China Epidemic Medical Support Team Leader).

“We therefore call for a worldwide discussion and debate on this topic,” says Dr. Cheng.",Low,,USA,0

The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a large-scale outbreak. The symptoms of COVID-19 are similar to the SARS outbreak in 2002 because the viruses have high genetic similarity. During the infection, SARS-CoV-2 represses the repair function and defense ability of lung macrophages, causes severe respiratory symptoms and acute lung damage, and even immediately causes death of infected patients.

COVID-19 and its First Line of Defense - Macrophages

Lung macrophages are important immune cells that protect against foreign pathogens when the lungs face bacteria and virus infection by using phagocytosis. Therefore, lung macrophages digest, degrade and remove these foreign objects and further activate the adaptive immune system to fight against unknown infection. Mitochondria are a major contributors to phagocytosis when macrophages remove the virus invasion. Mitochondria provide energy for the macrophage to increase their viability and produce reactive oxygen species to kill the virus. If the mitochondria in macrophage are damaged or cannot function normally, it will be insufficient to defend against the invasion of foreign viruses. Therefore, it is an important issue to maintaining immune system by keeping mitochondrial function when virus infection.

What does the Latest Research say about Mitochondrial Programs for Macrophage Support?

Originally, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was identified as atypical pneumonia from China in late 2002. This highly contagious respiratory disease, with an 8 to 15% death rate, rapidly spread to other countries within Asia and to other continents, causing devastating social, economic, and medical impact worldwide. The causative agent of SARS has been, after intense research, identified as a novel coronavirus (CoV), designated SARS-CoV. The transmission of this deadly virus is thought to be mediated through virus-laden droplets but also via either small-particle aerosol or fecal-oral routes, with the lungs as its main pathological target.

IL-6 and IL-8 are critical SARS-CoV-induced Calu-3 cell cytokines responsible, in part, for inhibiting the ability of DC to prime naïve T cells. Aliquots of DC were incubated with M-10 medium alone in the presence of control Ab and specific neutralizing Abs against IL-6, IL-8, or IP-10. Additionally, they were incubated with appropriate doses of recombinant IL-6, recombinant IL-8, or recombinant IP-10. After cultivation for 3 days, DC were harvested to assess the proliferation of naïve T cells in a standard MLR. One-way analysis of variance with Bonferroni's multiple-comparison test was used to determine the level of statistical significance. Data presented are collected from at minimum two independent experiments.

Dynamito MAPEs®, is a mitochondrial activation factor, extracted from these natural herbs by using our patented technology that has been granted many efficacy patents, approved from Taiwan, the USA, Japan, China and many other countries. Studies have demonstrate that Dynamito MAPEs ® can activate and protect the macrophages mitochondria, helping macrophages to establish the first line of defense when the human body against foreign unknown viruses (such as new coronaviruses and new influenza viruses) to avoid further lung damage, and improve macrophage function as well as body protection.

Specifically, antioxidant aim is to reduce the free radicals on the body tissue attack caused by injury or disease. Researchers used single plant extracts to conduct antioxidant testing, and the compounding of plant extracts; when compared to the composite plant extracts, it was found that the antioxidant capacity increased significantly. The cytoplasmic function of the cells was not destroyed by the hydrogen peroxide, and when compared to the control group the concentration of phyllanthus emblica, red polyphenol and green tea polyphenol in the compositions of the present invention were 50μg/ml, 50μg/ml and 5 μg/ml, respectively, the base energy of cytoskeletal cells increased by 1.13 fold when the concentration of the composition was 50μg/ml, 50μg/ml and 5 μg / ml, respectively, the energy produced by ATP increased by a factor of 1.6 times; and the energy used to cope with the stress was increased by 2.7times, energy per unit of linear body increased by 1.3 times, and the energy efficiency of oxygen consumption increased by 1.4 times. In addition, the occurrence of free radical leakage was also reduced by 44.3%.

Experiments clearly show that the free radicals involved in the energy production of the cells are effectively neutralized by many of the free radicals of our complexed plant extracts, and this action defends part of the free attack on body tissues. The intracellular activity of mitochondria was significantly enhanced, as well as increasing the number of stem cells.

Plan To Mitigate The Foreign Born Viral Coronavirus Invasion To America

There are simple and straightforward methods to blunt the coronavirus effects on America, given what we know about the spread of this virus, specific actions need to be implemented immediately. The facts are that the virus cannot spread without it getting access to a victim's mucus membranes via eyes, ears, and nose.

Staff on airplanes and other public transport in high-risk situations of coming into contact with those who are infected, should be issued simple reusable masks and gloves made from an ion infused copper cotton material that is anti-viral on contact. The cotton should be infused with copper ions which kill viruses on contact, and thus wearing a copper infused cotton mask with or without an N95 or N99 filters are a superior protection choice.

Prevention of mucus membrane exposure through contact with the hands or through inhalation along with use of tight fitting glasses will protect against cough droplets in the air, this is protection that can be manufactured inexpensively. Issuing colloidal silver in spray bottles to wash eyes will also greatly reduce risk of infection. A colloidal silver solution at 100 ppm is non irritating and universally viracidal as well as only costing a few cents per gallon to the manufacturer.

Technology now exists using nanotech vibrational tuning rods to detect the most infinitesimal amount of a discrete virus in solution. This technology is accurate to picogram scale. Originally developed in Germany, this technology has been commercialized and is being used for the detection of minute toxins in environmental materials. The same technology could be implemented for a very quick and inexpensive test for the virus, which would be much faster, cheaper and more accurate than the PCR technology currently being used. This would allow for instant screening of large numbers of people in rapid fashion at airports and other transportation ports as well as in the hospital and healthcare environments.

In the past HEPA air filters were in common use because the airlines knew that the air in the cabins was recirculating previously breathed air and could increase the risk of spreading airborne infection. Unfortunately today they do not use these advanced filtration systems, as that raised the modest cost to the airlines per flight, and to save this small amount of money they discontinued use of these air filters. Additionally, the airlines insist on flying with the air vents closed in order to again save on the costs of a small amount of jet fuel being used in heating the air for the cockpit and the cabin. It would be a simple solution to install HEPA filters again in the air filtration systems. Airliners and cruise ships should also open the air vents to allow for less cross-contamination and rebreathing of stale air.

A further solution would be the use of commercially available ozone generating machines between flights and airline cabins to detox and disinfect the cabin air and surfaces. A blast of ozone is a superb disinfectant and could easily cleanse an airline cabin in 20 to 30 minutes; the same technology would be effective for cruise ships and trains as well.

There are thousands of natural drugs, herbals, chemicals, plants and physical substances that have viral inhibiting and viral destructive capacity. A single lab could be used to test out these many products for the potential of a safe nontoxic answer to the coronavirus infection. A single lab with automated viral culture mass screening could quickly show which of the thousands of chemicals, drugs and other products of nature will stop this virus.

Finally quarantine at home does not work and will not work as this virus has a long wait and see incubation period. It is also near impossible to keep people completely isolated. The answer is neighborhood isolation trailers that could be constructed quickly and easily, these could be delivered to a specific location where people in quarantine could be housed in near where they live. These isolation homes where the air would be filtered and the sewage would be kept in special isolated disinfected septic tanks, would allow for families to visit via large windows without risking contamination and delivery of food to their relatives via a two-way isolation door system. This would be a more humane and effective means of maintaining strict isolation, while maintaining people in their own community and not overwhelming hospitals with the burden of highly infectious diseased individuals.

Patients on homecare with oxygen and BiPAP positive pressure airway therapy, would be on constant monitoring via telemedicine and Internet cameras, as well as medical telemetry to monitor their respiratory rate as well as their SA02 oxygen saturation, along with EKG, heart rate and their blood pressure. This monitoring could be accomplished via computer systems so that it was automated, again taking the strain and the stress away from the overburdened healthcare community.

Should a patient’s condition begin faltering, a team of highly trained intensive care technicians in full hazmat isolation gear could be dispatched to the patient’s location in a matter of minutes, or just to ensure that a patient on homecare was receiving good care. This system may be even better than patient care in the hospital and would allow for patients who were deteriorating on homecare, to be rapidly transferred to hospital based respiratory intensive care units.

Realize these technologies are off the shelf and are available at this very moment. The only question is the actual implementation of the system of remote controlled advanced high-tech medical care. This program could be in working status in a matter of days, and the cost savings would be immeasurable... the savings of lives.... would be even greater. All this with the added benefit of patients being able to isolate themselves at home in familiar environments, with the support of their already exposed family members.

Utilizing an advanced use of CPAP, as well as remote teams of respiratory intensive care technicians, virtual reality tele-medicine, health monitoring telemetry, positive pressure oxygen therapy, and airway support could be an absolute game changer never seen before in the annals of healthcare.

We owe the American people the best that we can provide.

This worldwide pandemic is a manageable problem that need not lead to mass disruption or mass deaths. There is certainly a drug or many drugs that can inhibit this virus and prevent it’s furthered deadly outcome. The simplest of which are measures to protect your mucous membranes and to protect your hands from becoming germ transmitters.

The American public deserves a better, more intelligent and more humane public health response from its Government. The above measures would give that to them at minimum cost and could be implemented in the matter of days, with no barriers stopping effective public health responses to this contagion impending threat to our nation.

2019-nCoV is a close relative to SARS as well as MERS-CoV, all of these viruses cause flu-like symptoms as well as frequently leading to pneumonia, and there have not been any effective treatments developed as of yet.

Rolf Hilgenfeld, Hong Liu and colleagues are working to develop a broad spectrum antiviral that can target all coronaviruses as well as enteroviruses, all of which share similar protein cutting main protease enzymes in coronaviruses and the 3C protease in enteroviruses that are essential for the viral replication.

X-ray crystal structures of the proteases were examined which was followed by creating a series of a-ketoamide compounds that are predicted to fit in the enzyme’s active sites to interfere with their function. Test tube and petri dish testing identified one versatile inhibitor that blocked multiple coronaviruses and enteroviruses, as well as another molecule that showed strong activity against MERS-CoV with moderate activity against other viruses.

Due to the main proteases of SARS-CoV1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 being very similar the inhibitors will likely have good antiviral activity against the Wuhan coronavirus, according to the researchers. The next phase will be to test these inhibitors in animal models of disease before eventually moving onto human testing.",Low,,USA,0

The announcement is in response to a proposal to move patients with coronavirus to a facility in Costa Mesa. However, the proposal has created a court battle, and at the center of the dispute is the proposal to use the Fairview Development Center as a quarantine site, this is what drew fierce and swift condemnation from officials representing the area.

“The county of Orange continues to support Costa Mesa in opposition of state and federal government’s decision to move COVID-19 patients to the Fairview Center,” Andrew Do the Vice Chairman of the Board of Supervisors said. But he notes that transportation of patients to these locations does not “preserve the health of our community,” of over 3 million people.

Costa Mesa has requested a temporary restraining order from a federal judge that has blocked plans to send coronavirus patients to the center, the status of which will be decided on March 2, 2020. US District Judge Josephine Staton has ordered officials to meet to answer specific questions about how the center was chosen.

Declaration of local emergency and local health emergency is intended to prepare not panic the community as this allows opportunity for officials to ask for mutual aid from country, state, and federal partners in the event resources become exhausted, and creates better leveraging of resources for staffing and agency coordination.

“With 60 U.S. cases of coronavirus, we are facing a real-life crisis that must be managed,” Orange County Supervisor Donald P. Wagner said. “I support an emergency declaration, not because I necessarily believe the public is in more danger, but because the federal and state governments refuse to give us enough information to discharge our public health responsibilities. We want to be vigilant in ensuring the county is prepared and has sufficient resources to prevent and combat any possible outbreak of COVID-19.”

Mayor Eric Garcetti of Los Angeles says the city is also taking precautions to monitor spread of the coronavirus, “The city of Los Angeles will continue to be proactive and take precautions to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and I commend our city and county response agencies for their hard work to keep us safe. My office is working closely with federal, state and county agencies to monitor the situation.”

In breaking news the FDA has announced the first drug shortage due to the coronavirus, which underscores the importance of securing a medical supply chain now. “We will do everything possible to mitigate the shortage,” the agency said in a news release.

“The situation seems to have evolved quickly; the agency seemed pretty confident in statements a week ago that there was little near term risk. This may underscore the complexity of the supply chain and the challenge of knowing where all downstream ingredients are sourced,” said Scott Gottlieb, MD on his twitter feed.

Gottlieb has been warning for months about the possibility of this virus spreading to America. Here is a 6 minute video of an interview where he talks about those who may be more vulnerable, the likely unknown spread, and the current lack of American diagnostic capability: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rel6TDmAnbE “We’re just seeing the tip of the iceberg.”

It would have been great if the interview was longer, or if the people at the news station stopped interrupting and let him speak. For those waiting on a vaccine, here is a direct quote from the Interview: “A vaccine might not offer sustained protection. You may get reinfected with it”. You can view a partial list of the vaccines and therapies for COVID-19 that are in development by clicking here.

Other countries appear to have far better diagnostic capabilities than America does, such as over in the United Kingdom where they have implemented random coronavirus testing for those displaying flu symptoms as part of their protective measures to slow the momentum of spread.

Over in Geneva the Swiss Government has announced an immediate ban on all private and public events in the country involving over 1,000 people as part of their protective measures to contain the spread of COVID-19.",Low,,USA,0

According to the announcement the patient was admitted to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento, California on February 19, 2020 from another hospital, but the patient was not diagnosed until 4 days later. The hospital called in the CDC to do the testing because they are not capable of doing so which is what caused the delay.

The hospital released a statement saying that the patient was placed under “strict contact precautions” and believed there “has been minimal potential for exposure here at UC Davis Medical Center.” Additionally some of the hospital staff have been asked to stay home and monitor their condition/temperature as an added measure of precaution.

There are over 60 confirmed American cases of the coronavirus, 43 of whom were passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan. The coronavirus is known to be highly contagious, but it is not fully understood how it passes from person to person. This first incidence of reported American community spread serves to reveal gaps in the testing capability in the United States which could very well hamper efforts to slow the spread of the virus.

As it stands only the CDC and a few local public health agencies have the ability to administer testing. The current administration recently announced that the Vice President will be leading domestic efforts to combat the disease, and the administration has requested $1.25 million in emergency funding for the effort from Congress, along with $1.25 billion in funding to be diverted from other federal programs; additionally the White House budget office will be moving $535 million which was allocated for the prevention and treatment of the Ebola virus towards this.

“We are asking the American public to prepare for the expectation that this might be bad,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said. “It’s not so much of a question of if this will happen in this country anymore but a question of when this will happen.”

For those hoping for a vaccine, keep in mind that even at rocket speed releasing any such vaccine would take at least a year at minimum to pass through development to animal testing, to initial human trials, and then the approval process. Some small initial human trials have begun involving a handful of subjects, and others are set to launch within a month, this will need to be expanded from the small numbers to include hundreds if not thousands of subjects in countries with active disease transmissions which could take another 6-8 months.

Over 27,000 people are listed as recovered from the coronavirus in China, these people may have blood supplies swarming with antibodies against the virus. Shanghai doctors have been collecting blood plasma from survivors to infuse into those who are infected, while this is not guaranteed to work it can sometimes be life saving. Shanghai doctors have also been using several medications (lopinavir, ritonavir, and Descovy) that are approved for HIV to those in severe respiratory distress. Scientists in China are also testing the antimalarial drug chloroquine, although not confirmed some reports are suggesting positive progress in patients receiving 400mg daily for 5 days.

Virus blockers such as the broad spectrum experimental remdesivir is a good prospect as it is active against viruses with genetic material made of RNA, it worked well in animals infected with MERS, but didn’t help much with Ebola. A study will be launched investigated remdesivir at the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha where some Americans are in quarantine.

In the meantime prevention will always be better than any cure, and it might be a good idea to consider giving your immune system a hand. Stay clear of any one who is sick, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face/food until you have washed your hands. Make sure you are getting enough sleep, and it might be a good idea to increase your garlic and vitamin C intake to boost your immune system. Don’t forget the importance of vitamin D in keeping the immune system strong and modulating the innate adaptive immune responses.",Low,,USA,0

Sangeeta Bhatia, author of the 6th report explained in a statement that, “We compared the average monthly number of passengers traveling from [outbreak epicenter] Wuhan to major international destinations with the number of COVID-19 cases that have been detected overseas. Based on these data, we then estimate the number of cases that are undetected globally and find that approximately two thirds of the cases might be undetected at this point. Our findings confirm similar analyses carried out by other groups.”

Previous research has shown that only a small subsection of confirmed cases display serious symptoms such as pneumonia, and globally researchers are working to understand how the virus spreads as well as determine why/if the virus can be transmitted by those who are not displaying any symptoms. Based on the numbers released by China the total fatality rate is fairly low, but this could change especially if the virus mutates, and there is speculation of the figures provided being seriously downplayed.

Globally there are over 78,000 confirmed reported cases, with new cases in Africa, Italy, South Korea, America, Iran, Asia, and China causing the reported number of causes and deaths to spike over the last few days. Financially even the global market is feeling the effects of the coronavirus leading to worries from investors regarding a global economic slowdown. The Chinese economy is suggested to have already taken as much as a $60 billion loss, and if the fallout from the virus can’t be contained it could cost the Chinese economy as much as a staggering $6 trillion. What is worse is that this could spiral outwards, as much of the world has come to rely on China, resulting in a global recession that many markets will not be able to weather.

With the continued widespread of the virus outside of China has some scientists worried, “We are starting to see more cases reported from countries and regions outside mainland China with no known travel history or link to Wuhan City,” noted co-author Natsuko Imai in the statement. Hence why their report “demonstrates the importance of surveillance and case detection if countries are to successfully contain the epidemic.”

Cases vary in severity of symptoms, making some cases harder to detect than others, and some countries have reported detecting significantly fewer cases than would be expected based on the volume of flight passengers arriving from affected cities, especially that of the epicenter Wuhan City, China.

Gina Cuomo-Dannenburg, report author, added: “We compiled data from a variety of publicly available sources, such as national and provincial ministries of health and local news, to determine information about travel history, exposure and symptom onset of individual patients observed outside of mainland China. We would like to thank countries for their continued transparency in presenting information on new cases, and would like to encourage communication of patient outcomes going forward to present a true picture of severity and clinical presentation.”

63% of cases are estimated to be undetected based on comparisons with Singapore only; when comparing with Singapore, Finland, Nepal, Belgium, Sweden, India, Sri Lanka and Canada 73% of cases of COVID-19 are estimated to be undetected.

Professor Christl Donnelly, report author, explained: “We were able to analyse data collected around the world to determine how individual countries compared to those who have reported and confirmed the high numbers of cases compared to their connectedness with Wuhan city (as judged by the average number of international passengers per month). Bringing these numbers together we have estimated that worldwide two thirds of COVID-19 cases exported from mainland China have not been picked up by surveillance programmes.”

Professor Neil Ferguson, report author, added:“Countries around the world have been focused on containing the international spread of COVID-19 by detecting cases in travellers from China. However, surveillance approaches and capabilities have varied between countries. The resulting variation in the numbers of cases detected in each allows us to assess what proportion of cases in travellers may have been detected overall, by comparing case numbers in the countries with the highest detection rates with those in other countries. In agreement with the results from similar studies, we conclude that approximately two-thirds of cases in travellers from China have not yet been detected. It is highly likely that some of these undetected cases will have started chains of transmission within the countries they entered.”

In separate research with findings published in the Lancet suggest that 61.5% of coronavirus patients with severe pneumonia will not survive; patients especially vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection which includes the old, young and those with existing conditions are more likely to die at a higher rate than they did from SARS and MERS.

This study of 52 critically ill adults of 710 at Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital has found that 61.5% of affected patients that required hospitalization and intensive monitoring succumbed to the virus to become “non-survivors.” Based on their findings the researchers concluded that COVD-19/ SARS-CoV-2 is more lethal for vulnerable patients than patients of MERS or SARS were; findings are presented in a series of tables breaking down each patient’s symptoms and path to recovery/death. The 52 patients had a mean age of 59.7 years old, 35 were men of which 40% had been diagnosed with some kind of chronic illness, 98% were found to have a fever, and 61.5% died by 28 days.

“Like SARS-CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus that can be transmitted to humans, and these viruses are all related to high mortality in critically ill patients.12 However, the mortality rate in patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort is higher than that previously seen in critically ill patients with SARS. In a cohort of 38 critically ill patients with SARS from 13 hospitals in Canada, 29 (76%) patients required mechanical ventilation, 13 (43%) patients had died at 28 days, and six (16%) patients remained on mechanical ventilation. 17 (38%) of 45 patients and 14 (26%) of 54 patients who were critically ill with SARS infection were also reported to have died at 28 days in a Singapore cohort13 and a Hong Kong cohort,14 respectively. The mortality rate in our cohort is likely to be higher than that seen in critically ill patients with MERS infection. In a cohort of 12 patients with MERS from two hospitals in Saudi Arabia, seven (58%) patients had died at 90 days.15 Since the follow-up time is shorter in our cohort, we postulate that the mortality rate would be higher after 28 days than that seen in patients with MERS-CoV.”

UPDATE: Switzerland, Austria, Croatia and Spain confirm first coronavirus cases: Two cases have been reported in Austria’s Tyrol state, one case in the Croatian capital of Zagreb, one in mainland Spain’s Catalonia region and one in Switzerland’s Ticino region, likely affecting European stock markets which closed around 2% lower on Tuesday; Italy continues to be the most affected country in Europe.",Low,,USA,0

Mitochondrial disorders are multi-systemic and commonplace, and it belongs to a prevalent category of inherited neurometabolic diseases (prevalence: 1:4300). Such diseases are clinically, genetically and chemically heterogeneous so that recognition and diagnosis are frequently difficult, but thankfully, for most of the patients, recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has led to great improvements in genetic diagnosis. Due to the variability of features and nature of the biochemical or genetic defects, early referral to a specialized center is recommended because improved diagnostics and NGS use have enabled an earlier diagnosis for many, as well as sometimes early instigation of effective therapy and precision medicine.

There is currently no cure available for the majority of such conditions, and clinical care is largely restricted to negating the complications of these diseases or assisting prevention through prenatal testing, mitochondrial donation therapy and preimplantation genetic diagnosis. As such, the limited options and lack of curative treatment options have created more opportunities and investments into individual therapy trials, focused on optimizing oxidative phosphorylation and improving antioxidant capacity. In essence, a combination of vitamins, including coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone), thiamine and riboflavin in addition to other regenerative medicinal approaches in the telomeres, stem cell and senescent cells is recommended. As of February 2020, more than 250 trials are ongoing worldwide investigating potential therapeutic approaches.

Mitochondrion Application Biomedicine Inc. (MAB or MitoBioMed) is one such company conducting such trials and aims to fulfil this mission by forming a strong competitive team with our medical institutions and customers, as a long-term and trusted technology and capacity provider in the global mitochondrial /cell therapy industry. Scientists are working night and day, racing to find a cure for the novel coronavirus. An East-meets-West combination of medicines is now suggested to be the recommended course.

With the advent of an ageing society, many studies in the past ten years have shown that mitochondria are closely related to ageing and degenerative diseases (such as neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease, etc). This is because when mitochondrial function is abnormal, it will trigger a lack of energy supply and oxidative stress, and even induce cells to enter apoptosis or autophagy, which will cause disease.

MAB also establishes a series of training and certification mechanisms for medical personnel (such as doctors) and cooperates with medical institutions and academic institutions around the world. This makes it a prime candidate for impact investing towards sustainability development, in alignment with the United Nations and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

The Company along with other biotech companies in the field have developed many product lines, including mitochondrial activated stem cells (Mitocell), mitochondrial biologics (Mitobio), mitochondrial activated immune cells (MAKcell), mitochondrial function tests (Mitoscan), mitochondrial aesthetic medicine, mitochondrial cell bank(Mitobank), mitochondria activated herbal extracts (Dynamito), mitochondria activated health food (Mitofood), mitochondria activation culture medium(Stemoto), etc., Mitocell, Mitobio, and MAKcell are all ready for the next phase of clinical development. Other products are cooperatively sold in the fields of preventive health care, medical beauty, cell culture, detection and analysis. These products have proven safety and effectiveness in preliminary studies.

Furthermore, Mitochondria for stem cell therapy is another frontier for regenerative medicine. Stem cells are primitive and unspecialized cells, they are a type of cells that are not sufficiently differentiated and have the potential to regenerate various tissues and organs. In medicine, stem cells have long been considered to have potential for medical applications because of their strong potential for treating physical damage caused by disease, aging, genetic factors or trauma. In international research, mitochondria are an important factor affecting the quality of stem cells. By analyzing the function of mitochondria in stem cells as a way to identify the quality of cells, it provides a scientific way to identify cell quality. The company's research is to improve the quality and function of stem cells by screening and increasing mitochondrial function. Stem cells activated by mitochondria have better therapeutic effects. Our company's mitochondrial activated stem cells have also been proven to be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Osteoarthritis, Multiple System Atrophy

Lastly, in addition to the aforementioned products in the market, mitochondrial replacement techniques (MRT) work to prevent transmitting mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) diseases from mother to the next generation. Such diseases vary in presentation and severity. The goal of MRT is to prevent the transmission of such diseases by creating an embryo with nuclear DNA (nDNA) from the intended mother and mtDNA from a woman with non-pathogenic mtDNA through modification of either an oocyte (egg) or zygote (fertilized egg). This will help alleviate common symptoms including developmental delays, seizures, weakness and fatigue, muscle weakness, vision loss, and heart problems, which in combination lead to an increase of morbidity and in some cases premature death. While research continues to be conducted, if effective, MRT could satisfy the desire of women seeking to have a genetically related child without the risk of passing on mtDNA disease.

In the US alone, mitochondrial diseases affect around 1 in 5,000 individuals. It is also estimated that 1,000-4,000 children are born with a mitochondrial disease every year Therefore, there is a direct need to focus on building a world class professional mitochondrial technology and manufacturing leader, with a purpose in creating affordable healthcare and biotech leadership in preventative medicine. It also creates a space for the community of social impact investing to be more deeply involved in health and wellbeing.",Low,,USA,0

Now, a new technology based on a combination of optics and magnetic particles can test 100 samples and reduce the diagnostic time down to about 15 minutes.

Currently there are over 80 reported clinical trials running in China to test possible coronavirus treatments, and the first new case has been reported in Africa, prompting concern over the spread of the virus after arriving in countries that may be vulnerable due to economic status or political instability.

According to Dr. Amos Danielli of the Alexander Kofkin Faculty of Engineering at Bar-IIan University this new technology can carry out saliva test analysis within 15 minutes, and the technology has already been proven to reduce diagnostic time of Zika virus and it is being used in the Israel Ministry of Health’s central virology laboratory.

Danielli’s lab developed a technology for sensitive detection of virus specific RNA sequences by attaching the virus RNA to a fluorescent molecule that emits light when illuminated by a laser beam; at very low concentrations of RNA the signal emitted is so low that existing devices can’t detect it. Magnetic particles that have been added to the solution enable them to adhere to the fluorescent molecules which allows for a greater concentration of fluorescent molecules and more accurate measurement.

""If we think of the saliva of a corona patient filling an entire room, then this laser beam can be compared to the size of a fist and at low concentrations of virus RNA, there might be only 2-3 fluorescent molecules within that fist,"" explains Danielli.

""This development relies on the use of two small electromagnets, which are magnets powered by an electric current. By properly positioning them, we were able to create a strong magnetic field and collect all the thousands of fluorescent molecules from the entire solution and aggregate them inside the laser beam, thereby multiplying the signal strength by several orders of magnitude. But that's not all. Instead of pumping the solution we alternately operate the electromagnets, once on the left and once on the right, moving the molecules from side to side, in and out of the laser beam. As they pass through the laser beam they become illuminated. When they exit the light beam they are no longer illuminated. This flickering allows us, without any additional procedures, to accurately determine whether a person has been exposed to coronavirus,” said Danielli.

High sensitivity and ease of operation of the platform enables facilities to use this technology in point of care applications where resources are limited to provide doctors with an alternative method for accurate and rapid detection. The researchers are also collaborating with European universities to identify antibodies that the immune system may be producing against the coronavirus; and he is looking for investors to help accelerate his R&D of the kit to get it introduced into hospitals.

Dr. Danielli develops systems/kits to help identify various diseases, while companies such as MagBiosense are developing devices about the size of a coffee machine which will be based on Dr. Danielli’s technology.",Low,,USA,0

Although some of the media is trying to downplay the coronavirus pandemic, and some even suggest that it is not real, footage is being leaked, and some establishment scientists are even warning that this outbreak may not be able to be contained.

Dr. Nancy Messonnier works for the CDC and previously was an epidemic intelligence officer with the Deputy director for Infectious Diseases under the CDC, as well as being an anthrax researcher and an African vaccine deployment expert. Messonnier was quoted as saying,“We are preparing as if this were the next pandemic,” and reiterating that it, “would be impossible” to fully contain the virus and prevent the outbreak from spreading.

Her word-for-word quote from Bloomberg reads:

“Total containment isn’t in the cards, said Nancy Messonnier, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “Given the nature of this virus and how it’s spreading, that would be impossible. Our goal is to slow this thing down… We are preparing as if this were the next pandemic.”

According to a CNN report she was also quoted as saying when speaking about quarantines of people traveling from China:

“It’s important to know that this strategy is not meant to catch every single traveler returning from China with novel coronavirus,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a press briefing Monday. “Given the nature of this virus and how it’s spreading, that would be impossible. But working together, we can catch the majority of them.” and the goal is “to slow the entry of this virus into the United States,” she said.

The quotes contradict other statements being given by the CDC, the mainstream media, and W.H.O; these authoritative sources are portraying the outbreak of the coronavirus as being under control and posing no threat to western nations. Yet here we have Messonnier who is a mid level scientist who probably is hard working and believes that she is trying to help humanity and carrying out good science in public interest, who is speaking something different than what we are being told to believe.

Her statement about the coronavirus appears as if she is trying to warn the world about what could happen. Messonnier is an expert in infectious disease, she can do the math and is able to see where this outbreak is heading with its exponential growth rate which is notably a reported 20% daily increase in infections that will double the number of infections around every 3.6 days, according to the rule of 72 estimates, or roughly twice a week.

Reportedly there are 10,000 people infected, this means that there will be another 40,000 infected in a little over a week later. However, most people can’t do the math, and don’t understand why a 20% daily increase will compound to a nearly 400% aggregate in just over 7-8 days. The rule of 72 may help to explain why the math checks out, as compounding interest/exponential growth is a powerful phenomenon.

It can be assumed that in Messonnier’s best judgement she is trying to warn everyone. The coronavirus appears to have broken containment going by rate of spread, she is aware that the best strategy now would be mitigation, and that America could become the latest battleground fighting to reduce the impact of the virus if it spreads from the cities here that are already known to have cases of infection. Going by available information, her background, education, and experience Messonnier seems to be a pretty smart cookie who wants to help save lives with her extensive knowledge, thus it is highly unlikely she would have made those statements without there being merit to warrant it.

Here in America the CDC still has a chance to contain the first wave of infection from the coronavirus, but the window of opportunity is mostly likely shrinking rapidly. Best guesses estimate that those odds are about 50/50 at containing the first wave, no doubt the CDC is working hard to track and isolate those who have been exposed in containment attempts. However, given what is known about the virus being symptomless until it is too late, there being several confirmed cases here already, and the virus continuing to demonstrate its self sustained airborne replication in countries outside of China means that America’s odds of having a perfect containment record, in all honesty, are dwindling quickly.

Interestingly enough Messonnier has been openly invited to write her own article on the coronavirus by a few news organizations outside of the mainstream media, many hope that she is allowed to do so.

Meanwhile video footage has recently been uploaded of disinfection work in the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus. It appears as if China is spraying entire city blocks, that normally would have been packed with people, in attempts to contain further outbreaks; lines of trucks and huge machines can be seen rolling down empty streets blasting plumes of white mist spray, and modified rickshaws sporting sanitizer cannons. Hopefully it doesn’t get this far anywhere else, and the outbreak really has been contained as we are being told.",Low,,USA,0

Viruses have been with us since the dawn of man. An estimated 380 trillion viruses can infect the human body at any one time. (1) Human biology is exquisitely tuned to defeat viruses or to coexist with viruses as part of the human viome. Our relationship with microbes is vibrant and sometimes a fight for one-upmanship. (2) Our existence is a testament to our ability to manage viral loads.

The pharmacopeias of the world, of some 500,000 different drugs, contain long lists of substances which have antiviral, antibiotic and immune boosting substances. This list alone of antiviral drugs (3) is impressive. It is almost certain that within the realm of the worldwide knowledge of substances, that some would exist which would counter the threat of the coronavirus and any other virus that overwhelms us.

Given the threat of global viral pandemics, how can the whole of the world’s medical and scientific communities not be mobilized and galvanized? Is it beyond the world’s governments to open the door of their various warehouses to find an antidote to the coronavirus which is now strongly suspected to have been developed as a bioweapon? If this is the case, it is almost a certainty that there are multiple antiviral agents already at hand to control this plague.

But, for a moment, let’s assume the opposite. That this coronavirus is a previously unseen natural biological agent created by Mother Nature on her worst day. The sum of the world’s scientific and academic brain power should still have the means to undo this clever virus.

A virus is a little thing with very few operating parts and no immune system of its own and no ability to reproduce on its own. The entire animal world including humans cannot have existed thus far without the knowledge and the means to overcome not only the coronavirus, but all virus pathogens whether bioengineered or not, collectively, can and do the governments of the world deliberately keep information from us? Some reporters are noting that the top virologists and microbiologists in the world are mysteriously dying or disappearing, to the toll of over 100 and counting. (4)(5) Why?

These are urgent times. The reality is that we have the ability, mindpower, and manpower. What we don’t have is the approbation of the powers that be. Doctors are not allowed to be doctors. Scientists are handcuffed into belief systems that must have authority approval. The coronavirus pandemic has been projected to kill as many as 65 million people (6). If projections hold true, this is a time that requires great courage to step out and tap into our incredible human resources. Some world leaders have called for a population reduction by at least 15% and some as high as 90%. (7)

Those who have become physicians must step up and act as the healers and leaders that they intended to be. We are now in a situation that demands a higher calling. Step up and do what you know to be right for yourself and humanity, there may not be a next chance if you do not.

Following is a short list of available therapies which can have a positive impact on quelling a pandemic. Some therapies should be used right away to make sure that your immune system is in order. Some should be used at the first sign of illness for speedy recovery. Finally, some will be offered for cytokine storms. The immune system overreacts to the infection, and the resulting inflammation overwhelms the body. Cytokine storms can lead to sepsis (infection carried in the blood stream leading to organ collapse) which is often fatal. However, there have been successful interventions for sepsis and the preceding pneumonia.

There are well documented and proven interventions that have been reported in clinical literature again and again over the past 100 years - you must not ignore the solutions on hand while waiting for officially approved new proprietary drugs while people are dying.

Ionic Solutions and Colloids of Silver and Copper

Before antibiotics, silver was the antibiotic of choice. Silver solutions can be prepared to drink on a regular basis as preventative or used to treat. Silver solutions can be used in neti pots for the nose or simply used as a nasal spray. In extreme cases, silver has been used as an intravenous treatment. (8). Copper solutions can be used to disinfect surfaces.(9)

Ozone

Ozone is a gas which quickly converts into oxygen which can treat any infection. It can be added to water to drink, used to clean produce and surfaces. It can be used in therapy in the ears, vaginally and rectally. It is too irritating to the lungs to inhale unless bubbled through an oil first. Ozonated oils can be used on the skin. The American Association of Ozone Therapy (AOT) website provides information and a physician referral. A trained practitioner is needed for ozone to be used intravenously. (10) Dr. Robert Rowen teaches ozone therapies to train practitioners. He traveled to Sri Lanka to treat Ebola with ozone injected directly. (11) Before being impeded by an authoritative government, he was able to demonstrate recovery from Ebola with ozone. He pioneered doing an intravenous therapy using 10 passes of ozone. This can be used for the most resistant of infections.

Oxygen/Hyperbaric Oxygen/Hydrogen peroxide

Oxygen can be delivered in other forms to deal with infections. At the first sign of respiratory distress in hospitals, patients are given oxygen to breathe. Home units of oxygen concentrators can be used to improve oxygenation. Hyperbaric chambers supply extra oxygen to the whole body at pressure. Tissue oxygenation happens while bypassing the lungs. When hydrogen peroxide bubbles, water and oxygen are released yielding its disinfectant qualities. Hydrogen peroxide can clean surfaces, and it can be used in the ears and gargled diluted in water at the first sign of a cold or flu. Hydrogen peroxide is also used medically intravenously and provides increased oxygen levels for the body.

Hydrochloric Acid, Hydrogen

There is a book documenting the incredible effects of hydrochloric acid (HCl). “Three Years of Hydrochloric Acid Therapy” which can be viewed by clicking here. Hydrochloric acid is used both intramuscularly and intravenously and provides an immune system boost. Molecular hydrogen ions or hydrogen gas can be used therapeutically to quell oxidative stress. The science behind hydrogen is compiled at the Molecular Hydrogen Institute. (12)

Intravenous and Oral Vitamin C

Vitamin C is available to use orally and has been ever since Dr. Linus Pauling demonstrated its antiviral effects. To use orally, instructions are to use vitamin C in frequent dosing to the point of getting diarrhea and then backing down but not stopping and continuing till resolved. Vitamin C can be taken daily for maintenance. Dr. Pauling himself used about 30 gm of vitamin C daily. (13) 60 Minutes aired a segment on the miraculous recovery of a New Zealand man who was given intravenous vitamin C and recovered quickly from a viral infection after doctors had recommended that the family stop all life support, and death would ensue in 1-2 days. Normally, you would think that this would shake the medical communities of the world to action to provide intravenous vitamin C for all critical infections. Intravenous vitamin C is a mainstay in functional medicine but is not to be found in our hospitals. Search out providers ahead of time in case this modality is needed.(14) Dr. Fred Klenner used both intramuscular vitamin C and intravenous vitamin C for numerous viral infections including polio successfully. However, his groundbreaking work was ignored in favor of the promotion of a vaccine program. (15)

Ultraviolet Blood Irradiation or Photo Luminescence

Exposing the blood to the ultraviolet spectrum of light was developed in the 1920’s and also suffered a fate like Dr. Fred Klenner’s treatments for virus infections. This time it was the advent of penicillin that became the favored treatment. In this approach only a small amount of blood is removed and exposed to light in the ultraviolet range, then the blood is returned to the body. Then there is a profound increase in oxygen, and blood immune components are improved dramatically. This treatment can be used to quell the dangerous cytokine storms and rescue patients from sepsis. The equipment and supplies are very inexpensive and treatment time is just minutes. There are practitioners who still use this therapy in their practices.(16) (17)

This article highlights some of the opportunities that can and should be implemented in managing a pandemic. Effective treatments have already been developed and abandoned, sometimes for less effective treatments. Some of these are do it yourself solutions, and most need the intervention of a skilled practitioner. Be prepared by learning where and how these therapies can be readily accessed. There is much more in that warehouse of human ingenuity. Remember the most vulnerable are the young, old, and those with existing conditions. This discussion will be continued.",Low,,USA,0

Health authorities in the Republic of China are focusing more and more on millennia-old traditional medicines to treat the novel coronavirus which has so far reportedly killed more than 630 people and infected over 32,000 worldwide.

It has been reported that eight patients infected with novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) pneumonia have been treated and cured by a combination of TCM and Western medicine in Jinyintan Hospital in Wuhan, which is the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak. The patients were discharged from the hospital on February 4, 2020. They are the first batch of patients cured by such a hybrid treatment in the hospital, one of the designated institutes admitting patients infected with the virus in Wuhan, capital of central China's Hubei Province.

As such, the National Health Commission of China on recently published its latest treatment plan designed to target symptoms of the coronavirus, and is urging medical institutes to include both molecular medicine and traditional Chinese medicine in their formulas. Currently there still is no cure for the virus yet, and with an increasing death toll and infection rate, national authorities are looking for a cocktail mixture of Asian and Western medicines in hopes of preventing further spread and saving more lives.

Their announced treatment plan suggests that there are certain traditional Chinese medicine therapies, using the most advanced DNA codification technology to mitigate patients’ symptoms — including fever, shortness of breath, fatigue, lack of energy and nausea — that could be applied depending on the patient’s “recent state of illness, local climate characteristics and current physical condition.” Boehmeria nivea, Chinese patchouli, sun-dried tangerine peels, betel nuts, as well as the Peaceful Palace Bovine Bezoar Pill — a mixture of cattle gallstone, buffalo horn, and pearl and ruby sulfur, among other ingredients — are all being considered or already prescribed under the plan.

Just as Asian medicine is currently being promoted to fight the coronavirus — as it was in 2003 during the SARS epidemic — supporters of the age-old practice believe the government’s push will give the long-debated industry a chance to prove its worth.

In the case of Boehmeria nivea, as presented by Forall Biotech to the Shanghai CDC authorities, its purported reasons to support mitigation and relief of the associated symptoms stem from its rich content in: Chlorogenic Acid (C16H18O9), Caffeic Acid (C9H8O4), p-Coumaric Acid (C9H8O3), Ferulic Acid (C10H10O4), Gallic Acid (C7H6O5), Benzoic Acid(C7H6O2), Epicatechin (C15H14O6), Rutin (C27H30O16), Isoquercetin (C21H20O12) and Hyperoside (C21H20O12).

As an example, for HCV Particle Entry, Caffeic Acid is associated with Apolipoprotein E, which attaches to the plasma membrane and promotes capsid uncoating and HCV RNA emission. For Tannic Acid, it leads to binding of receptors and induce endocytosis.

More research needs to be undertaken to test whether such an approach could provide a cure for the virus. In the meantime, TCM treatment shall not be directly aimed at combating viruses, but more to regulate and uphold the body’s immune system.

Zhang Boli, director of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine said during a press conference that TCM treatment, “is not aimed at viruses, but more to regulate the body’s immune system. It is not advisable for everyone to take Chinese medicine for disease prevention.”

Zhang Guojun, a professor at Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine says, “Traditional Chinese medicine plays a role in the entire clinical process, no matter if it’s for the diagnosis and treatment of common ailments or for severe problems.”

Jiao Yahui, deputy director of medical administration and supervision at the National Health Commission says TCM has played “a very important role” in alleviating the symptoms of coronavirus patients. She added that it has also helped delay mild cases from developing into severe ones, which “can be verified by clinical data and cases.”",Low,,USA,0
68,https://www.worldhealth.net/news/are-officials-china-downplaying-infection-numbers/,WorldHealth.Net,2020-02-05,[],Are Officials In China Downplaying Infection Numbers?,https://www.worldhealth.net/media/original_images/AdobeStock_55585362.jpeg,"Some agencies are reporting that officials in China are keeping two sets of coronavirus infections numbers: a set they let the public see, and the actual numbers. Recently this infectious disease has been spreading globally, and experts have been warning that China has been significantly understating the true numbers of infections and deaths caused by the coronavirus.

Now apparently evidence has emerged that allegedly supports those sentiments, and this evidence appears to indicate that officials in China are keeping two sets of numbers regarding what they want the public to know about the numbers of infections and deaths and the actual numbers.

“As Taiwan [News] reports in a report first spotted by user @TheHKGroup, over the weekend, Tencent “seems to have inadvertently released what is potentially the actual number of infections and deaths, which were astronomically higher than official figures”, and were far closer to the catastrophic epidemic projections made by Jonathan Read,” reports Zero Hedge.

“Netizens also noticed that each time the screen with the large numbers appears, it shows a comparison with the previous day’s data which demonstrates a ‘reasonable’ incremental increase, much like comparisons of official numbers. This has led some netizens to speculate that Tencent has two sets of data, the real data and ‘processed’ data,” the publication to Taiwan news reports.

Officials in China claim to be updating websites such as QQ.com daily, the official numbers still list the infections to under 25,000 and it appears to be expanding at roughly 20% per 24 hour period which represents a doubling of infection every 3.5 days due to growth being compounded.

Observers have noticed an inadvertent slip in the official numbers being reported by the communist Chinese government to suddenly show far higher numbers of confirmed infection and deaths being at 154,024 infections and 24,589 deaths, before being reverted back to the much lower supposedly official numbers.

Naturally first reactions may think it was a typo being corrected, but there appears to be more to the official story that is not wanted to be known. The higher numbers did not appear by themselves, and they were not out of context. Above each number is an increase factor that calculates how much more the day’s current numbers are compared to the previous day. For the 24,589 deaths in the lower right of the chart the number above it displays as +1546, the Chinese characters beside it explain compared to yesterday. The number above the infection count of 154,023 displays as +20979, the Chinese characters beside that similarly explain day over day increase from the previous day.

This indicates that there is an underlying database that is tracking these daily numbers that is being used to calculate differences. The numbers are being automatically calculated, if human error were to blame for inputting the incorrect numbers it would be highly unlikely that two more incorrect numbers would coincidentally also appear above those numbers to accidentally show day to day increases that are consistent with a second set of numbers being stored in parallel.

Of course it could all just be some form of a typo, but it supports claims of the Chinese government having two sets of numbers relating to the coronavirus, and releasing numbers that are significantly far less than the real numbers to the public.

Taiwan New Reports:

Some are speculating that a coding problem could be causing the real “internal” data to accidentally appear. Others believe that someone behind the scenes is trying to leak the real numbers.

However, the “internal” data held by Beijing may not reflect the true extent of the epidemic. According to multiple sources in Wuhan, many coronavirus patients are unable to receive treatment and die outside of hospitals.

A severe shortage of test kits also leads to a lower number of diagnosed cases of infection and death. In addition, there have been many reports of doctors being ordered to list other forms of death instead of coronavirus to keep the death toll artificially low.

W.H.O is praising China for its “transparency,” but is the praise unjustified? Based on videos, reports, whistleblowers, doctors and independent journalists who are reporting from within China, it seems that officials in China are, not surprisingly, trying to significantly downplay the true number of infections and deaths associated with the outbreak of the coronavirus being shown to the rest of the world. The allegedly leaked numbers are more in line with what experts are suggesting, but it could just be a coincidence as well.

Are officials in China trying to significantly downplay the true numbers regarding the coronavirus???",Low,,USA,0

The new antiviral shows promise for treatment of herpes simplex, respiratory syncytial virus, HIV, hepatitis C, and the Zika virus among others; and it has been demonstrated to be successful in treating a range of viruses in lab studies including genital herpes.

Virucidal substances such as bleach are typically able to destroy viruses on contact but they are toxic to humans, meaning they can’t be taken or applied to the body without causing harm; creating virucides from sugar has allowed for the advent of a new type of antiviral drug that can destroy viruses without being toxic to humans.

Antiviral drugs currently work by inhibiting virus growth, however, they are not always reliable as viruses can mutate and become treatment resistant. As published in the journal Science Advances the team successfully used modified sugar molecules to disrupt the outer shell of a virus thereby destroying the infectious particles on contact, this approach was also shown to defend against drug resistance.

Modified molecules were successfully engineered using natural glucose cyclodextrin derivatives that attract viruses before breaking them down on contact to destroy the virus and fight the infection.

""We have successfully engineered a new molecule, which is a modified sugar that shows broad-spectrum antiviral properties. The antiviral mechanism is virucidal meaning that viruses struggle to develop resistance. As this is a new type of antiviral and one of the first to ever show broad-spectrum efficacy, it has potential to be a game changer in treating viral infections."" said Dr Samuel Jones, from The University of Manchester and a member of the Henry Royce Institute for Advanced Materials, who jointly led the pioneering research with Dr Valeria Cagno from the University of Geneva.

""We developed a powerful molecule able to work against very different viruses, therefore, we think this could be game changing also for emerging infections,” said Professor Caroline Tapparel from the University of Geneva and Prof Francesco Stellacci from EPFL, who were both also senior authors of the study.

This new antiviral molecule has been patented, and a company is currently being set up to continue moving this new development through all of the required processes to get it to real world use. This treatment may make its way to pills, injections, nasal sprays, ointments, and creams for viral infections in the future as it can work to break down multiple viruses making it a cost effective new option even for resistant viruses.",Low,,USA,0

First the nasty will remain inactive in a non-hostile liquid, wet or moist medium, when that environment dries out the virus can then remain dormant in a dry state for weeks to months depending on the type of virus.

Viruses are expelled out from an infected body into the air after a person sneezes or coughs. Unless covered up a sneeze can eject at over 100 miles per hour and as many as 50,000 individual aerosolized micro droplets of saliva and other moisture can be expelled to travel for a distance between 19-16 feet according to research from MIT.

Uncovered aerosolized blasts of mist expelled from the cough or sneeze will be carrying viruses and bacteria, each of these droplets can hang in the air for minutes or longer depending on the size and weight of the droplet. Anyone who is not infected can walk into these particulates and inhale them to then become infected.

In addition to inhaling the tiny aerosolized mist some of it can land in the moist eye to gain entry to the body and begin infection, all without the uninfected person knowing, and for the majority of people without them even thinking that the eye can be a portal to infection. Should an uninfected person touch a contaminated object/surface such as a door knob, elevator button, countertop, pen, or ATM/debit card station button they may even pick up disastrous microbes that have been left behind by an infected person. The potential to pick up a live virus while out in public is scary and enormous.

""These tiny droplets float through the air and you can get a cold, the flu or another illness when you come into contact with them. Sneeze and cough germs spread far and fast,"" explained Dr. Stephanie Kelleher, a Geisinger family physician.

Recently, a physician in Wuhan China says that he is positive that he became infected with the coronavirus via his eyes when he was working with infected patients. It is rather easy to do as explained above. Simple walk through an area where someone has coughed or sneezed, or even touching a contaminated area and then rubbing your eyes/mouth/nose will immediately re-activate the virus in the moisture.

Even the Ebola virus has been confirmed to be living in human eyes. Potentially any wet, moist non-hostile surface/medium/environment outside of the human body can become a host to any virus or bacteria. When that dries up they will still remain there in a dry state in wait to be picked up by someone who then will touch their mouth, nose, or eyes which will put the virus back into a wet and warm environment where it will readily begin to quickly replicate and infect its new host almost immediately.

How long a virus or bacteria can survive outside in a dry state without a host varies, in the case of TB bacteria that can be for decades. It has not yet been determined how long the coronavirus can live outside a host, but conservative projections are at least 5-7 days. Keep in mind it could be longer as in the case of HIV it has been shown to live in a dry state for far longer than that.

To protect yourself, especially when out in areas where infection is known, you should wear an N95 rated face mask with a moisture barrier, and you should consider wearing eye protection as well. Wearing gloves, washing your hands frequently and keeping them away from your face and food until you do is most important. Be aware of where you are and the potential places where transmission of disease can occur such as those touched and shared by literally thousands of people which includes retail store card terminals, pens, school/work/library desks, elevator buttons, store door handles, public restrooms, public transportation poles/handles, shopping carts, crosswalk buttons, playground equipment, handrails, steering wheels, touch screens, computers/laptops, and more, they are all just crawling and teaming with a legion of microbes.

The numbers on the image correspond with the numbers in the article body.

1. This epidemic virus spread may be cancelled with a simple and very inexpensive decontamination kit that you can purchase most of the parts for at your local discount dollar shop. The materials mentioned in this article can help to stop infections from spreading by mouth, nose, eyes, ears, and hands by providing a personal protective barrier.

The Low Cost Viral Defense Kit

2. A clear plastic whole face mask can provide protection for your eyes, nose, ears and mouth. These are typically manufactured from plastic materials similar to common plastic bottles. They have a small opening at the mouth hole that allows for easy breathing, and this opening has protection with a respirator like filter to prevent virus inhalation or an antiviral imbedded filter respirator mask material for your safety.

3. Hoody jackets or parkas with hoods that pull tightly around the mask with elastics on the waist and wrist form a seal. These are manufactured with materials that are threaded with both copper and silver threads that kill viruses on contact.

4. Antiviral/anti-infectious gloves contain antiviral solutions bound right into the material. These gloves also have elasticated wrists for protection of hands and reduce the possibility of picking up unwanted germs.

5. Having a simple decontamination kit ready when you arrive at your destination will give you the ability to spray down the gloves, hoody and mask. Once sprayed with the antiviral, which should be packed waiting in a large bucket, store all materials in the container while not in use with a tightly sealed lid.

Infections can’t occur unless they are given an opportunity to penetrate the mucous membrane of the eyes, mouth, and nose. This simple low cost kit will help to reduce the spread of the coronavirus as well as other pathogens to keep the wearer safe.

Five minute PCR diagnostic testing

Airport surveillance for infectious disease is little more than TSA theater.

The coronavirus is reported to have an incubation period of eight days or more which means that an individual would not display symptoms early in the infection, and could transmit the virus to many others around him.

6. A more effective and intelligent means of identifying those at risk to themselves and others would be a rapid PCR test that only requires a swab against the cheek or tongue for a quick analysis within five minutes with an accuracy near 100%. This test and could be easily done prior to boarding and would ensure that no one on board would be transmitting viral particles to other passengers with the costs for such testing being very minimal.

Airlines as incubators

It’s been said that flying for hours with 300 strangers in the cabin is like spending an evening in a sewer pipe.

7. A readily available solution to this situation is to open all air vents to purge the cabin in-flight with fresh air, as currently almost all air in the cabin is recirculated including viral particles in the air making most flights the equivalent of biological gas chambers. There are commercially available viral filtration, ozonation and ionization devices that will fit into existing airline air conditioning systems to improve the quality of air, and reduce the risk of infection. Airlines have been reluctant to implement such public health measures due to increases in costs per flight.

Once on the ground airline cabins can be effectively disinfected by flushing the cabin air with a highly concentrated blast of ozone and ions which will seek out and bond to all biological compounds. Currently there are ion generators available at low costs.

Innovative Therapeutics

8. An exciting new technology is Photo Modulation Intravenous Blood Irradiation which can be easily accomplished thanks to recently developed technology that allows for intravenous delivery of photosensitizing agents to the blood that can have specific antibacterial and antiviral actions as well. Ultraviolet/ozone/ or red laser light irradiation of the venous blood itself can be achieved through a simple IV line. This technology has been proven to be remarkably effective in laboratory tests against multiple different viral and bacterial infectious pathogens.

Proven safe and natural therapies

9. There are dozens of well-known safe and natural TCM herbal nutritional botanical or pharmaceutical agents that have demonstrated strong antiviral actions and/or immune stimulating actions that can be recruited in the treatment of coronavirus.

ozone, liquid iodine, garlic, turmeric, ginger, oregano, zinc, star anise, basil,

rosemary, peppermint, echinacea, apple cider vinegar, green tea, colloidal silver,

astragalus, selenium, vitamins C/D/E, elderberry, liquorice, St John’s wort, and tea tree oil.

Hand Hygiene

Hands are the number one source for spread of bacteria, viruses and other pathogens that are looking to infect you by gaining access to the body via your mucus membranes. So wash your hands often, again and again. Make sure to wash your hands frequently when in public, especially after using the restroom, before handling/consuming food, touching your face, or after touching highly used things such as door handles, crosswalk signal buttons, and elevator buttons, and then again when you return home.

Wet your hands with clean running water and apply soap. Lather your hands with the soap making sure you wash the back of your hands, between your fingers, palms, wrists, and under your nails to remove all dirt, organic matter, and most of the transient organisms that may have been acquired through contact with another person and the environment. Do not give these nasties the chance to penetrate your mucus membranes from your hands.",Low,,USA,0

While there is no cure for the flu, there are ways both pharmaceutically and gentler more natural approaches to help soothe flu symptoms that may help to shorten how long you are sick.

It is very important to drink plenty of water and other fluids, especially when you are not well to help your body loosen and get rid of built up mucus and phlegm to clear away. It is also very easy to get dehydrated when you are not feeling well and are not drinking or eating normally. In addition, fever, diarrhea, and vomiting can cause water loss.

To help your body stay hydrated other than drinking water you can also drink coconut water, herbal teas, fresh juice, soups, broths, and consume fresh fruits and vegetables. You will be able to tell if you are drinking enough liquids if you have to urinate frequently, and the colour of your urine is pale yellow or clear. If your urine is deep yellow to amber you may be dehydrated.

If you are a smoker it may be best to refrain from the habit while you are ill as much as possible because it can further irritate your nose, throat, and lungs.

It is also important to get more sleep when you are sick because sleeping helps to boost the immune system which will help your body fight off the virus. If you have plans it is best to cancel those to avoid spreading the virus and to make sleep a priority to help your body get back on your feet.

Warm chicken or beef bone broth is also good to consume to help stay hydrated, it will help to loosen and break up nose/sinus congestion. Bone broth is an excellent source of natural minerals such as potassium and sodium as well as replenishing other nutrients and protein that are important to rebuilding immune cells while you are sick.

Zinc is important for the immune system, it helps the body make germ fighting white blood cells, and research suggests that it may help to ease cold and flu symptoms as well as help the body fight the virus while slowing down how fast it multiplies. Zinc can be supplemented or obtained through diet in sources such as red meat, shellfish, lentils, beans, eggs, dairy, lentils, chickpeas, nuts and seeds.

A salt water gargle can help to soothe a sore throat and clear mucus. Boil water and let cool until at room temperature, add ½ teaspoon of salt to 8 ounces of warm water and gargle at the back of your throat for at least 10-30 seconds to rinse your mouth and throat. Spit out into sink and repeat 2-4 times. Please don’t swallow the salt water, and don’t use on children, they can safely gargle with plain water.

Many herbs carry natural antiviral and antibacterial properties that can help while you are sick. Star anise is the star shaped spice that oseltamivir (Tamiflu) was extracted from traditionally. This has antiviral properties that can be effective against some strains of the flu virus. Other herbs that may help can be brewed into hot herbal green/black teas to help soothe symptoms to mix with star anise include turmeric, ginger, garlic, and cloves. If you would like some sweetness try using honey rather than sugar, for best results try royal jelly which has been shown to have natural antibacterial and antiviral properties. Some natural health stores may even have bagged teas with all of these ingredients already combined together.

Essential oils may help to protect you against certain bacteria and viruses. Tea tree oil has been shown to help combat flu viruses by slowing or stopping the rate at which the virus multiplies; research suggests it works best when used within 2 hours of infection. Adding a few drops of this essential oil to hand soap or lotions can help to stop spread at a common source, and some mouthwashes also include tea tree oil as an ingredient.

Other essential oils and plants that also have natural antivirals and antibiotics include cinnamon oil, peppermint oil, eucalyptus oil, geranium oil, lemon oil, thyme oil, and oregano oil. Be sure to use these oils only as directed, and do not ingest essential oil as many are toxic. Most can be used on the skin after being diluted with a carrier oil such as coconut, olive, or almond oil. Fresh dried herbs and spices can also be added to the mixtures for added benefits.

Essential oils diffused into the air may also help against some strains of viruses and bacteria. However, it is not advised to use this kind of aromatherapy on children, pets, while breastfeeding or during pregnancy.

Flu viruses prefer dry indoor air in which they can survive longer, and spread more easily. Colder outdoor temperatures typically lower humidity, as such using a humidifier in your home and workplace may help to reduce flu viruses in the air.

Steam inhalation therapy uses hot water vapor to help loosen mucus congestion which may help to relieve swelling in the nose/lungs, as well as soothe a dry cough, irritated nose, and chest tightness. It is best to avoid steam from water while it is boiling, and test the temperature before breathing it in to avoid scalding or burning yourself. You can even add a few drops of essential oils or medicated vapor rub to the hot water for added antioxidant, antibacterial, and antiviral benefits.

Having a flu that is affecting your stomach is difficult as it can cause nausea, cramps, diarrhea, and vomiting. During this time only eat small hand sized portions of food at a time, and stick to bland foods that are easier to digest such as bananas, rice, toast, applesauce, crackers, soup, broth, and boiled potatoes. Try to avoid any food that may irritate your stomach and digestion such as caffeine, milk, cheese, spicy food, fatty food, fried foods, and alcohol.

Most flu viruses will typically cause respiratory symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, body aches, runny/stuffy nose, sore throat, dry cough, tiredness, fatigue. Stomach flu viruses cause digestive symptoms such as chills, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and cramps.

Sometimes flu viruses can lead to other health complications by triggering other viral or bacterial infections in the ears, lungs, throat and other areas to promote sinusitis, ear infections, encephalitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. Those who are at an increased risk for such complications include those with other health conditions, adults over the age of 65, and children who are under the age of 5.

If you are sick with a flu virus it might be best to speak with a doctor if you have a chronic condition such as asthma, diabetes, kidney disease, liver disease, epilepsy, sickle cell anemia, heart disease, stroke, or a lung condition.

If you have a fever over 100.4°F/38°C you should see a doctor, and you should seek medical attention if your symptoms are not improving after two weeks. Be sure to see a doctor if you are having trouble breathing, chest pains, chills or sweating, mucus that is an odd colour, blood in mucous, severe cough, or high fever.

Viruses can cause both cold and flu, both infections will give you a fever, and both have similar symptoms the main difference is how bad the symptoms are and how long they last. Flu symptoms are typically sudden and severe, lasting 1-2 weeks. Cold symptoms are generally milder lasting for one week or longer.

Most cases of the flu will not require medical attention, if you are sick, please stay home and rest so that you don’t spread it to other people at work/school. Home remedies can help to reduce symptoms to make you more comfortable and rest more while you are ill, and the rest will have an enormous influence on how quickly you get better.

Quick tip from Dr. Klatz with the scare of this novel coronavirus spreading to boost your immune system make sure that you are getting enough vitamins C and D, as well as selenium, garlic, and liquid iodine to help fight off any cold or flu viruses looking to set up camp in your body.

Influenza (flu) is defined as an acute, commonly epidemic disease, occurring in several forms, caused by numerous rapidly mutating viral strains and characterized by respiratory symptoms and general prostration. (1) The flu has a major impact on the lungs. Colds start in the nose and upper respiratory tract. Vomiting and diarrhea are assigned to yet another viral family.

Corona Virus

We are currently in the grip of a media frenzy and potential public health disaster. A new type of corona virus has emerged from a large city in China, Wuhan, and the world is bracing for an impact of a major epidemic. We have been here before, however, we have already experienced MERS (Middle East respiratory syndrome) and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) along with the same specter of massive numbers of deaths. Corona viruses are thought to be generally mild and not very virulent. This type of virus is found very commonly in animals. Some now believe that the virus for MERS, SARS and now the Wuhan Virus has somehow unnaturally been transmitted to humans, and humans have now become another vector for this infection.

Western Medicine, Louis Pasteur and Antoine Béchamp

We have developed Western medicine primarily by following the teaching of French chemist Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) and the Germ Theory of Disease. Pasteur believed that diseases were caused by outside pathogens invading the body. Antoine Béchamp a Pasteur contemporary, disagreed. He believed that it was that the condition of the body, the terrain, was the source of illness. A healthy body is dependent upon its acid/base balance; its charge; the amount of toxicity and its nutritional status. Only tissue that is already diseased can harbor organisms that become pathogenic. We are starting to appreciate our complicated relationships with the microbial world as we have begun to explore the wonderful world of our microbiomes. This disease theories of Pasteur have led us to the doctrines of virology and immunology. This evolution began before we learned anything about vitamins, trace minerals and other nutrients. (2)

Vaccinate!

Western medicine is now leaving the world of antibiotics. Antibiotics are failing and have served to create more pathogens that are resistant to antibiotic treatments. Western medicine is now embracing vaccination. And why not? There are untold numbers of microbes and 7.8 billion people on earth to experiment upon. Pharmaceutical companies have more and more vaccines in their pipelines. All they must do is to convince us and our governments that their vaccines are the only thing that saves us from vast epidemics, severe illness and probably death. And not a surprise the Corona virus has already been patented. Even at best, this season’s flu vaccines have already proven to be 70% ineffective. The promise of herd immunity does not hold up with vaccinated populations. (3)

Nine Months to a Corona Vaccine

On January 23, 2020 the company Moderna, Inc announced that it is partnering with the US National Institutes of Health (4) to develop a vaccine to prevent infection by the corona virus within the next 9 months. They promise new technology to address this life-threatening epidemic. Sound good? It might be if vaccinations worked. It might be if organisms didn’t rapidly mutate to new forms as they pass through their vectors. It might be if vaccines didn’t also depend on heavy metals to aggravate the immune system. It might be if animal and human DNA from the viral growth medium weren’t injected into the body without any clue for the long-term consequences. Vaccines do not work.

How is the Flu Deadly?

Most of us have experienced the respiratory illness that is characterized as the flu at some point in our lives. Temperatures rise as it is part of the body’s natural defense mechanism, but not always. There are aches and pains and general malaise and coughing. Most of us take to our beds until we feel better. However, some days after the viral assault, pneumonia (inflammation of the lungs), caused by bacteria can set in. This infection can become life threatening as it spreads, and organ systems become compromised. If someone is already struggling with organ system problems, let’s say with cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or renal issues, this can become the tipping point. The infection can lead to sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response, shutting down organ systems leading to death. Even in young healthy people, this response, also called a cytokine storm, can overwhelm the body.

Back to Antoine Béchamp

This is the other option. We can choose to help our body’s terrain remain in its healthy state, and if we get sick we can choose to return our body to that healthy state rather than embrace warfare on our microbial world and be left with the consequences of the “friendly fire”. The rest of this article will focus on staying well and getting well despite a flu epidemic. Admittedly, it is getting to be more and more difficult. Our water, our air and our food have become compromised like never before in human history.

Basic and Free (or almost)

Wash your hands. We can’t live our lives and avoid contact with other people. However, we can minimize the challenges to our immune system by frequently washing your hands. After the SARS outbreak in 2003, a Toronto epidemiologist related that the installation of numerous handwashing stations and maintaining sanitary protocols stopped the spread of SARS in its tracks. (5)

Plain soap and water will do. You can find alcohol and chemical wipes everywhere, but this is not the best choice as these chemicals strip your skin of their natural oils which also protect you. It’s better to use wipes that have been infused with essential oils. Essential oils have power antiviral activities and can be inhaled and infused. Using a diffuser in public spaces such as schools could cut down viral transmission. This reference holds a long list of the most effective essential oils and herbal remedies. (6)

The So-Called Flu Season.

“...it has been my observation that those patients receiving a Vitamin D injection in the fall have never had a substantial cold or flu during the winter. Interestingly, the dose of a single injection is 400,000 IU (International Units). While that seems a substantial dose, after administering many thousands of injections, I have never seen an example of the Vitamin D levels climbing too high. As a matter of fact, some individuals are so depleted at the intracellular level that they might need 2 or 3 injections over the winter months to preserve optimal levels of vitamin D.” Dr. Dale Guyer, Indianapolis posting in Facebook.

Vitamin D is a primary tool for preventing infection of all kinds. The flu season coincides with the greatest lack of sunshine and the opportunity to create vitamin D in the skin. It is easily supplemented. Optimal levels should be 70-80 ng/ml. Supplementing vitamin D can be preventative. High doses can be used to treat an acute incidence of the flu. (7)

Linus Pauling and Vitamin C

Linus Pauling’s claim to fame was to make vitamin C a household word. He extolled the virtues of vitamin for prevention and treatment for colds and the flu. Vitamin C can be used in smaller doses as prevention and ramped up to bowel tolerance for treatment. In severe cases, a physician may offer even higher doses in an IV treatment to speed recovery from the flu. Using vitamin C in a phospholipid delivery system can also provide higher and effective doses. (8)

Hydrocortisone

Dr. William Jefferies spent his entire career studying hydrocortisone or cortisol. In his 80’s, he made an interesting discovery. After deliberately infecting some volunteer students, he discovered that the virus inhibited the pituitary hormone ACTH which is responsible for the adrenal production of hydrocortisone. That feeling of malaise and the aches and pains and headaches that come with the flu are quickly eradicated by using supplemental hydrocortisone. Practitioners can provide the drug Cortef to be used orally. However, hydrocortisone 1 % cream can be found in drug stores and applied to the skin. To prevent the flu, establish that there are no underlying hydrocortisone deficiencies. Practitioners rely on an Adrenal Stress Index saliva test or morning cortisol in the serum to identify problems. Dr. Jefferies used maintenance doses such as 5 mg of hydrocortisone every 6 hours. In the case of an acute flu, larger doses should be used immediately, and relief is rapid. (9)

Ozone

Antibiotics are starting to fail as mentioned above. But we really don’t have to worry much despite the dire prognostications. Ozone, a gas, which is a very reactive form of oxygen can treat any infection. Ozone treated water can be used in hand washing and cleaning surfaces. Ozonated oils such as olive oil can be gargled if there is a sore throat. You can use ozone in your ears, vaginally, or rectally for a full body treatment. You can also ozonate your bath water. A practitioner can help you with intravenous options if a serious infection has persisted. The American Association of Ozone Therapy is a great resource to learn about ozone. (10)

To Be Continued

We are just scratching the surface so far on all the methods we may use to deter getting an infection and what steps we can take to treat an infection. Humanity has survived on the earth for millions of years. There are multiple modalities, both conventional and traditional that can strengthen the immune system and help prevent infections. We can open the door to rediscover and identify our rich histories of healing modalities. We have choices. We don’t have to rely only on hastily devised, unproven and untested therapies alone.

Travel bans have been put in place and extended from central China to effectively put tens of millions of people in local lockdown. The virus was first detected in Wuhan where workers are racing to build a thousand bed hospital to treat patients affected by the disease.

All around China, including in the capital Beijing authorities are cancelling all temple fairs and festivals that would accompany the Spring Festival to avoid having large public gathering which would create the perfect scenario for the airborne virus to spread further.

More than 830 cases of coronavirus infection have been confirmed, at least 26 people have died, and another 8,420 people are reported by be under quarantine and observation for possible infection after a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from people who attended a seafood market in Wuhan on Dec.31.2019, ten days later the full genomic sequence of virus was made public.

A young healthy man from Wuhan has died raising concerns regarding the deadliness of the virus as up until then the vast majority of victims have been over the age of 60 with preexisting conditions.

A lockdown is being enforced across large parts of the province of Hubei affecting over 35 million estimated people. The chinese medical system is struggling to cope with the outbreak as seen in the reports of overcrowded hospitals, stressed medical workers, and dwindling supplies.

Two cases have now been confirmed in France by the French health minister, one being in the city of Bordeaux and the other in Paris, both patients were recently in China and authorities suspect that more cases will likely emerge.

There are concerns that people may be contagious with the virus even before exhibiting symptoms, and panic has spread along with the disease with most reactions being based on partial or misinformation making the matter worse. Without clear updates coming from official sources, rumors and misinformation commonly spread rapidly via sources such as social media.

“We have to get serious about the threat of coronavirus coming from China. I don’t trust Communist China to coordinate in a transparent and efficient manner,” Senator Rick Scott said in a statement. “I’m calling on the administration to declare a national public health emergency to stop the coronavirus from spreading within the United States.”

Taiwan has also confirmed its first case of the coronavirus this week, and convened a high level meeting to discuss the outbreak and called upon W.H.O not to exclude their country. “Taiwan has been on the front line of fighting previous disease outbreak in the region from SARS to swine flu,” Longman Chung, a representative of TECRO wrote in the email.

A case was recently detected in a Chinese national living in Kanagawa Prefecture in Japan; the man returned from Wuhan, was hospitalized, has recovered and been discharged. The man said that he did not visit the seafood market in Wuhan that also sells live animals and other meats, according to the CDC he may have come in contact with an infected person while there which raises the possibility of human to human transmission.

In Washington senators attended a special briefing with health officials to hear the latest developments of the outbreak. Public health authorities acted quickly in Illinois after a case emerged Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said “They identified, isolated and did contact tracing on the people with whom that person came into contact,” he said. “That’s how you get your handle on an outbreak.” But he said that he “wouldn’t be surprised if there are additional cases.”

“We are monitoring the outbreak of a novel coronavirus closely and are in close communication with United States government agencies on actions and precautions needed to prevent further spread of this virus,” the senators said. “The Chinese government has taken steps to share information with international health experts, and we encourage their cooperation and transparency as this situation unfolds,” they said. “We will continue to work closely with administration officials to ensure the United States is prepared to respond.”

American officials are assessing the extent and duration of screening travelers in the USA who have come from Wuhan at San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, Atlanta, and Chicago airports. The lockdown in China means that fewer travelers will be arriving from there to America. A labor intensive airport screening is being conducted by the CDC, but sick patients with no symptoms may not be detected.

Martin Cetron, director of global migration and quarantine at the CDC says to help control the spread of the coronavirus resources need to be focused on state and local levels, where frontline health officials are trying to identify cases.

According to W.H.O officials are developing contingency plans for the outbreak that could very well last for months and infect thousands of people as there are still many unknowns about the novel virus, its trajectories, transmission and symptoms. What is clear is that the number of cases will rise.

The CDC has deployed a team to Chicago to help official after a woman was diagnosed with the virus. Officials expect to see more cases: “Although the outbreak is a very serious public health threat, the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low at this time,” said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.

In both confirmed American cases in Seattle and Chicago the patients were not displaying any symptoms until they returned on their flights from the Wuhan area; both began to feel unwell and contacted healthcare providers right away. There may also be a case of infection in Texas.

“The Brazos County Health District said Thursday the patient traveled to Texas from Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus originated, but that they didn’t yet know their path home and if that path took them through the heavily trafficked Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport or Bush Intercontinental in Houston,” reports an NBC affiliate in Dallas, Texas.

“Based on the patient’s travel history and symptoms, healthcare professionals suspected this new coronavirus. A clinical specimen was collected and sent to CDC overnight, where laboratory testing yesterday confirmed the diagnosis,” the CDC said in an earlier statement.

Washington health officials said in a statement that the man had returned from visiting a region near Wuhan, China, he landed at Seattle’s international airport last Wednesday. Feeling ill soon after, he reached out to his healthcare provider on Sunday. In a statement, Washington state health officials said, “Human to human spread has been confirmed. How easily or sustainably this virus is spreading remains unknown.”

Early studies of the viral genome suggest a molecular similarity to SARS, the viral outbreak in 2002 that sickened over 8,000 people and killed 774. This new virus stems from a family of pathogens long thought to be relatively benign and typically causing a common cold. During the SARS outbreak it took 20 months from the time of getting the genome of the first virus to a clinical trial, it now takes around 3.5 months for other viral diseases.

According to the CDC there are currently no vaccines against the coronavirus, you may be able to reduce the risk of infection by frequently washing your hands while in public and immediately when you return home; avoid touching your person and food with unwashed hands; and avoid close contact with those that are sick.

Additionally there are no specific treatments, most will recover on their own, you may be able to relieve symptoms by using a room humidifier, drinking plenty of liquids, and staying at home to rest. It is recommended to contact a certified medical professional if you are concerned about your symptoms, especially if you have been in contact with a person infected with this novel virus.",Low,,USA,0
