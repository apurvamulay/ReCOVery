Under the terms agreed to by Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the Jewish state would not seek any additional funds beyond the annual $3.8 billion. Indeed, when Congress voted on an earlier version of Rubio’s bill in 2018, that figure was set as a cap. The 2018 bill was eventually rolled into another Middle East security bill the following year, which was left to die in the Democrat-controlled House.

spending cap has been removed. In the version passed by the Foreign Relations Committee on Thursday, the US will send “not less than” $3.3 billion in direct military aid and $500 million in funding for missile defense programs every year for the next decade.

Rubio boasted on Thursday that the bill “strengthens our nation’s strategic security alliance with Israel, a vibrant democracy that faces growing and unprecedented threats to its security and stability.” Yet the bill was passed with no fanfare, and in a state of near-secrecy.

The Foreign Relations Committee voted on it alongside a package of 15 other bills, with committee head Jim Risch (R-Idaho) foregoing the usual live-streaming of proceedings. Some of Risch and Rubio’s Democratic colleagues voiced concerns about the hush-hush nature of the session, but none objected to passing the bill, which amounts to the largest such aid package in American history.

The vote was not covered by American media, and was noted by only a few anti-Israel activists. Should the full Senate vote attract more coverage, it will likely draw some criticism. Even before the coronavirus hammered the US economy, support for Israel among the American public was falling. According to a Gallup poll taken late last year, 59 percent of Americans sympathized with Israel in the Middle East conflict, down from 64 percent a year earlier.

France is planning on auctioning 5G frequencies to telecoms companies at the end of the summer. However, Martin Bouygues, head of the eponymous communications firm, now thinks that bidding should be pushed back to the end of the year at the earliest.

Also on rt.com DHS & FBI fear more attacks on 5G infrastructure fueled by Covid-19 conspiracies

“We need to push back the auction date simply because the economic world today is not the same as it was early March, when the terms of the auction were set,” he told Le Figaro on Saturday, adding that holding a bidding war while France recovers “with difficulty from a terrible human health and economic health nightmare” is “not the priority of the country.”

Bouygues is not an opponent of the technology. Indeed, his firm has already secured a 50 megahertz block, as have rivals Orange, Free, and SFR.

His opposition to the auction likely stems from the fact that France is currently facing an economic recession, with growth expected to drop by eight percent this year after an extended and nationwide lockdown. As such, the return on his investment simply wouldn’t be as large as it would have been pre-pandemic.

However, Bouygues also noted that the rollout of 5G technology has come in spite of growing public mistrust.

Aside from claims that Chinese firms like Huawei could use 5G hardware to relay secrets to the government in Beijing – pushed by the Donald Trump administration in Washington and denied by Huawei and China – 5G has become a target for conspiracy theorists the world over. Fueled by some lingering uncertainties over the potential health consequences of 5G’s short wavelength transmissions, skeptics have claimed that 5G masts can trigger anything from cancer to Covid-19.

Some of the more radical among these conspiracy theorists directly blame these broadcasting masts for causing the coronavirus in the first place, despite the lack of evidence to support their claims. 5G towers erected in the Netherlands and UK have been set on fire by activists, with British protesters going as far as spitting on and attacking the telecoms engineers installing the masts.

The situation is the same outside Europe too. Arson attacks on 5G infrastructure have been reported in Australia and New Zealand, while the US Department of Homeland Security warned last week that online “misinformation campaigns” have “already prompted arson and physical attacks against cell towers in several US states.”

The only thing to fear is fear itself… and coronavirus. Our response to this disease stems from a very Western form of privilege.

As someone who has been writing about social media movements for many years, I can tell you that they always follow the same formula. They start out with good intentions, then quickly devolve into a method of feeling superior by demonizing others. The Covid-19 pandemic has been no different.

Back in early March, it was useful to have people explain why carrying on with the St. Patrick’s Day parade in NYC – where I live – was very much a bad idea. The lockdown was necessary. We swallowed that bitter pill and all of the major repercussions that came with it. We certainly burdened but didn’t overwhelm the healthcare system. We limited the spread and flattened the curve.

Also on rt.com The 5 tribes of coronavirus: Society has divided up in surprising, and not so surprising ways

But, now, many of those same people want more. They speak of second waves and how leaving your apartment will inevitably result in the death of their grandmother. They label anyone who is trying to make the best of the quarantine as “selfish” because we’re supposed to “all be in it together” in misery. They “pandemic shame”— a term used to describe those “Good Samaritans” who write vitriolic comments on photos of people reading in Central Park, or flat-out hurl a face mask at a friend of mine who was speaking on the phone outside of her building while yelling “Think of someone other than yourself!”

These people see themselves as self-righteous and heroic in a selfish world. But I personally believe that much of their behavior stems from anxiety, and that it shows a lack of self-awareness and selfishness to project that onto others and feel entitled to controlling their behavior.

“Like a lot of things that are fear-based, people don’t have any actual information, so these pandemic shamers are trying to regain a sense of control,” licensed psychologist Dr. Julie Davelman says. “So they tell themselves that if only everyone stays inside, we’ll be OK. Humans like to know what’s going to happen, and when we don’t have that, we make it up.”

To phrase it in the simple terms that Katherine, a Russian nurse living in Brooklyn, puts it, “People keep acting like we’d all live forever if it weren’t for the coronavirus. There are a lot of things that can kill you. The only thing that’s special about Covid-19, outside of the fact that it’s new, is that we’ve fixated on it.”

When I see people raging on social media about how no one should go out in case they touch a plant that someone who has Covid-19 might have touched, I feel the same way I imagine people must have felt when I used to tell them that it was extremely important that I check the oven several times before leaving the house, because, if I didn’t, the entire building might burn down, and I would have to live with the guilt of knowing that I not only killed my dog but hundreds of innocent people inside of it. Yes, all of this is true, just like it’s true that catching/passing on Covid-19 has a minor chance of being fatal.

But it’s also true that anything terrible can happen at any time, and, you’re not doing yourself any favors by living in fear of one specific thing that you’ve focused on. When you go to therapy for anxiety, one of the interesting things about it is that you aren’t taught to rationalize yourself into believing that you turned the oven off. You are encouraged to tell yourself that perhaps you left it on, and perhaps the worst will happen. It’s a free-fall, and it’s oddly liberating when you embrace it.

“Worrying isn’t actually an effective way of controlling problems, but we feel like it is, so we do it.” Davelmna says. “If worrying was an effective way of preventing something from happening, then nothing bad would happen, because at any given time, there’s at least one person worrying about every single thing. Because of that, people act as if worrying or protesting against someone else not worrying is a way of regaining control, which feels important because right now people feel very powerless.”

The thing that’s insidious about anxiety is that you worry so much about one specific thing that it ends up destroying other elements of your life. I worry about the oven, and end up being late to everything, which has consequences. The same could be said of how certain groups believe we should handle Covid-19. It’s reductive to make the argument that it’s about conservative versus liberal or that it’s about money versus saving lives. As Edelman put it, forcing people into a position in which they don’t know how they’re going to feed their children is not saving lives.

But I also find a lot of this pandemic-shaming to come from a very American type of privilege. As the NYT columnist Jennifer Weiner puts it, much of it seems to stem from “Coronavirus Karens.” For those not up on their internet lingo, a “Karen” is a term used to describe someone who is usually white, privileged, and middle-aged, and gets a power-high from telling a barista that they would like to “speak to the manager” because the foam on their latte wasn’t low-fat.

I see a lot of pandemic shaming coming from them toward ethnic groups like Russians who are still taking their kids on walks through parks, or Jews who are still gathering for Shabbat or minorities who grew up in neighborhoods with high crime rates.

I always think that they fail to recognize that this is the first time in a long time in American history when we’ve all had to collectively sit down and consider the fact that we’re all going to die someday. People who have had death hovering around them since they were young, on the other hand, would naturally feel like this is just another day in their life.

For what it’s worth, my experience is that confronting death comes in more or less three stages:

Stage One: Fear and panic. That's the natural and appropriate initial response.

Stage Two: An exploration of “what it all means” in light of this terrifying prospect. I think that's the stage most of us are in now.

Stage Three: You accept the fact that, no matter what you do, you really can't control how and when you die, but you have a lot of control over how you live, and as such, choose to try to live life to the fullest regardless of your personal circumstances. This is a very good stage and it lasts.

I’m not suggesting that we don’t take precautions. We absolutely should. It’s a good idea to wear a face mask when we go outside, just as it’s a good idea to make sure nothing is on fire before we leave the apartment. But I do think that anything past that is built on fear, and fear-based decisions are never good ones.

Speaking to talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Friday, the Florida Republican slammed Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and its economic policies. Asked whether relations between the two superpowers had entered a “Cold War 2” phase, Scott replied “absolutely.”

“There’s no question about it,” he said. “They’re in for world domination. They take our jobs, they take our technology, they put people in prison for their religion.”

“Understand you have an enemy,” he continued. “They’re an adversary. It’s called Communist China. They’re not here to help us, all right?”

Scott called Beijing’s decision not to alert the World Health Organization about the Covid-19 outbreak in Wuhan until January “intentional,” and suggested a boycott of Chinese-made products until the east Asian superpower is held “accountable.”

The Floridian lawmaker, who sits on the Senate’s Armed Services and Homeland Security committees, then called for the US to sanction China “for violating Hong Kong’s independence."" China, on the other hand, has accused the US of deliberately stoking protest in the semi-autonomous city-state.

Scott’s anti-China broadsides are not the musings of a single Republican war-hawk. Instead, they represent a growing consensus in the US, with bills threatening Beijing with sanctions being introduced and a number of Republican saying they will sue the Chinese administration for its alleged role in the coronavirus pandemic. That’s as President Donald Trump has been raging at China throughout the pandemic, suggesting that Covid-19 was cooked up in a Chinese laboratory, and threatening to “cut off the whole relationship” with Beijing.

Trump’s outburst was likely hyperbolic, but the official line coming from the White House is equally uncompromising. In a policy document outlining its strategic approach to China, the White House this week revealed a “fundamental re-evaluation of how the United States understands and responds to the leaders of the world’s most populous country.”

Accusing China of “predatory economic practices” and “malign behaviors” that undermine national security, the document stated that the US is now engaged in “long-term strategic competition” with Beijing, and will orient its military toward this competition, and toward supporting its “regional allies and partners” in the Pacific. And all of this on top of the Pentagon prioritizing China as an adversary in 2018.

Beijing’s responses, meanwhile, have been subtler. In Hong Kong, it has sought to portray the US as meddling in its affairs, and the conflict between protesters and mainland authorities as an internal matter. Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, China has threatened to respond with “painful” countermeasures if Congress applies sanctions or files lawsuits. Globally, as the US continues to deal with more than a million active cases of Covid-19, China has gone on a charm offensive, shipping test kits and protective equipment to the worst-hit countries in Europe.

Militarily though, Beijing continues to pump money into hypersonic weapons and artificial intelligence research – two areas in which it has the edge on America. Its navy has also not been deterred by American patrols in the South China Sea, and continues to assert sovereignty over this hotly disputed tract of water.

Police had to intervene after a small group of about 120 counter-protesters, many of them clad in black hoodies, repeatedly ignored police requests to stay clear of the ‘Vigil for the Basic Law’ rally against the lockdown measures on Saturday.

The counter-demonstrators, who showed up unannounced, lacking any permission from the authorities, argued that the anti-lockdown rally attracted many right-wing extremists. “Against conspiracy fantasies, anti-semites and the right-wing agenda,” one of the posters read.

Although both rallies ended without a major incident, scuffles broke out between police and counter-protesters. A bottle was hurled at the officers from the crowd, police said. One person was arrested but was released later.

The anti-lockdown gathering was greenlit to go ahead after organizers agreed to cap the number of its participants at 750 instead of some 3,500-4,000, as originally requested. The Hamburg Administrative Court ruled to limit the number of those who could join the rally so police would be able to enforce the social distancing guidelines, imposed to stem the coronavirus pandemic.

Less than 20 minutes after the meeting officially kicked off, at about 3:17 p.m. local time, the maximum allowed number of participants had already arrived, police said, noting that it had to block more people from coming.

The demonstrators stood several feet apart from each other, chanting slogans and holding anti-lockdown banners, some of which read: “The right to distance instead of a ban on contacts,” “Free accessible tests for everybody instead of the quarantine for everybody” as well as “Stop the corona madness! Basic law now!”

The participants of the rally denounced the government’s response to the outbreak, which has seen some 177,850 testing positive for Covid-19, including 8,216 who have died as a result of the disease.

One of the speakers at the rally argued that more people have died due to planned surgeries being postponed than from the virus itself. There have also been calls to make future vaccinations voluntary, although the authorities have never said that the coronavirus shot would be mandatory.

Several dozen rallies for and against the lockdown measures were also held in Berlin, including outside the Reichstag building, home to the German parliament.

That gathering also prompted a counter-action, with demonstrators branding those opposing the coronavirus restrictions “tin foil hats” and “Nazis.” Some 1000 police were deployed to ensure social distancing. In the wake of the protests, some 180 people faced administrative and criminal charges for violating the restrictions, including The Infectious Diseases Protection Act, police said.

The illness has so far claimed three lives across the Palestinian territories.

The victim, who had been suffering from a prior illness, recently entered Gaza from Egypt and was quarantined on arrival. The Palestinian Health Ministry announced her death on Saturday.

The woman is the first coronavirus patient to die in the 41km-long patch of territory, whose 1.8 million residents are walled off from Israel to the north and east, and from Egypt to the south. Three deaths have now been recorded by the authorities in Gaza and the West Bank, and another two in Jerusalem, which is claimed by the Palestinians as their capital.

Also on rt.com How on earth is Palestine supposed to cope with Covid-19 – and where is the international outcry?

The Palestinian territories have fared relatively well throughout the coronavirus pandemic. A total of 423 cases have been recorded by the health ministry – just 83 per million people. By contrast, neighboring Israel has seen nearly 280 deaths and 17,000 cases, or 1,900 per million.

However, the low number of infections likely reflects the limited testing capacity in the territories. Ventilators are a scarce commodity, and, even before the pandemic, the Israeli blockade of Gaza was highlighted by the World Health Organization as hindering Palestinians’ access to quality healthcare. Across the Palestinian territories as a whole, fewer than 80 intensive-care unit (ICU) beds are available to treat the sickest patients.

Still, with case numbers low and no patients needing these ICU beds at present, the Palestinian authorities eased the lockdown measures in the West Bank on Monday, reopening stores and permitting local travel. Nonetheless, a wholesale ban on movement between cities and towns was not lifted in time for Saturday’s feast of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.

The BBC is also under fire after its political editor jumped to defend the move.

News of Dominic Cummings’ egregious lockdown breach emerged on Friday night in reports by the Mirror and Guardian news outlets. In March, the prime minister’s closest adviser allegedly traveled from his London home to his parents’ farm in Durham, in northern England, when a strict lockdown was already in place and after he displayed symptoms of coronavirus.

In a bewildering move, the BBC’s political editor Laura Kuenssberg leaped to the defense of the government adviser on Twitter. She replied directly to a post by Daily Mirror political editor, Pippa Crerar, to say that a “source” had informed her that Cummings’ trip was “within guidelines,” as he had made the 400km journey to stay with his parents so they “could help with childcare while he and his wife were ill.”

Source says his trip was within guidelines as Cummings went to stay with his parents so they could help with childcare while he and his wife were ill - they insist no breach of lockdown — Laura Kuenssberg (@bbclaurak) May 22, 2020

The BBC chief political reporter’s decision to cite unnamed sources in a bid to spin a story that made the government look bad raised the hackles of many, with countless people asking why Kuenssberg was acting as a spokesperson for the government. It was repeatedly noted that there is no childcare provision in the lockdown measures, something of which Kuenssberg surely should have been aware.

“Does the BBC have no consideration for millions of grandparents who, respecting the rules, have made the sacrifice of not seeing their grandkids over the past two months? Like his boss, Cummings acts with impunity while the press fail to hold him to account. #NameTheSource,” musician Billy Bragg wrote.

Piers Morgan’s succinct reply simply dismissed Kuenssberg’s reporting as “absolute nonsense.”

The BBC’s Laura Kuenssberg is now commenting on other journalist’s posts in an attempt to defend Cummings.In what world is that ok?!More than 300 health and care workers have died for heaven’s sake. https://t.co/XGbFrsI25n — NHS Million 💙 (@NHSMillion) May 22, 2020 Just the BBC Political Editor replying with Tory spin to another journalists story about Cummings breaking the lockdown advice.

The continent was the epicenter of the pandemic until cases skyrocketed in the United States.

Europe passed the two million mark on Saturday, meaning the continent now accounts for nearly two-fifths of the world’s confirmed cases.



New infections and deaths have fallen in the worst-stricken European countries. As summer approaches, lockdown measures have been relaxed, and Spain – the world’s fourth-worst affected country – will reopen for international tourism from July onwards, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced on Saturday. Greece, Portugal and Italy will all welcome visitors again next month, while France will open its borders with neighboring Switzerland and Germany.

Though a relaxation may be coming soon, visitors to these countries will still need to abide by social distancing rules, and in some cases, may have to quarantine themselves upon arrival.

While the disease originated in the Chinese city of Wuhan, an explosion of cases in Italy, Spain, and France made Europe the coronavirus hotspot of the world from March onwards.

However, the United States then saw a skyrocketing rate of infection, and now accounts for more than 1.6 million cases. Brazil and Russia have also reported drastic rises in infections, with both countries now reporting more than 330,000 cases each.

The Russian Foreign Ministry has issued a rebuke to the US Department of State over its newly-published grant notice on Friday. The grant “opportunity” will see a hefty sum of money – some $250,000 – awarded to “an organization with experience in counter Russian disinformation, analysis and programming,” which will have to “produce a report on Russian and Soviet health-related disinformation campaigns” under the watchful eye of “subject matter experts” from the State Department’ Russia Directorate. The prospective contractors will have till June 20 to apply for the grant.

The ministry said that such a move at a time when all countries should be pooling efforts to combat the Covid-19 outbreak has revealed the true colors of those in charge of the US State Department’s day-to-day operations.

Also on rt.com Civil war among ‘Russia disinformation’ crowd: How RT watchers fell out over not hating RT enough

The ministry argued that the State Department staffers seem to be “working their own program,” paying little attention to the signals coming from US President Donald Trump, who has recently greenlighted a shipment of 200 ventilators to Russia, the first 50 of which arrived in Moscow on Thursday. The life-saving equipment is part of a $5.6 million “humanitarian donation” the US has earmarked to Russia. Moscow has said it’s “grateful” for the help, having itself sent a planeload of medical supplies and equipment, including face masks and ventilators to coronavirus-hit New York in early April.

Hailing the mutual assistance, the State Department also struck a reconciliatory tone, with a spokesperson telling CNBC on Tuesday that the US “seeks a better relationship with Russia on many fronts,” adding that both countries “will no doubt” provide humanitarian assistance to each other again if such a need arises.

The mixed signals coming from the US show that “powerful Russophobes” still wield much clout both in Washington and within the American government, “never ceasing to engage in the destructive activity,” the foreign ministry said.

Wouldn't it be more useful to allocate this $250,000 to the countries in need of assistance, to save someone’s life?

The likely targets of the future “counter-disinformation” campaign will be the Russian media, such as RT and Sputnik, the ministry predicted. While the Russian outlets have been repeatedly accused of spreading fake news over the pandemic by mainstream media in the West, the allegations have so far rung hollow, with a recent report by a UK watchdog pointing out that such claims against RT are based on bad methodology.

He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in genetics

Sweden has found that just 7.3 percent of Stockholmers have antibodies for coronavirus, despite the country’s laissez-faire handling of the outbreak. The mainstream media think this proves them right. It doesn’t.

Just last week, I criticized a piece of reportage in the Guardian, that grand old publication, for its remedial understanding of coronavirus. They are at it again, this time holding up an antibody study as evidence that Sweden, a land of dangerous wrong-think, is killing people with its coronavirus policy.

First, let us deal with the study itself. It reported that, based on antibody tests – which are supposed to detect people who have had and cleared the coronavirus – far fewer Stockholmers had had the virus than thought, which would mean that Sweden has a long way to go to reach herd immunity. But the thing about antibody tests is that they are utterly unreliable.

Also on rt.com Shameful treatment of the elderly is further proof Sweden got its Covid-19 strategy all wrong

There is no way to know what proportion of infected people generate antibodies. And even if they all do, we don’t know how accurate the tests are in detecting them. Therefore, as Professor Sunetra Gupta of the University Oxford confirmed on Thursday, the figure that comes out of an antibody test is a lower bound of the proportion of people who have been infected. A more honest reporting of the data would have read “At least 7.3 percent of Stockholm had Covid-19 antibodies by the end of April.”

Sweden turns heel

In order to turn on their usual social democratic idols Sweden, the Guardian has had to spin harder than a hamster on a wheel. They have decided to find a metric on which Sweden can be made to look bad, and they have chosen to compare its deaths per million to the other Nordic countries. Deaths per million is a laughably crude metric that takes no confounding factors into account – least of all the wildly different reporting countries use for Covid deaths. At the bottom of the Guardian’s graph is a disclaimer reading: “Note: counting methods vary by country.”

Sweden does score higher than Denmark, Norway and Finland on that particular metric, due in large part to their failure to keep the virus out of nursing homes. But in order to ascribe this difference to Sweden’s decision not to shut down their economy, the Guardian must establish that France, the UK, and above all Belgium – well above Sweden in deaths per million – have been even more laissez-faire than Sweden regarding the virus. But of course this is impossible.

Also on rt.com ‘Swedish model’ of no-lockdown response to Covid-19 ‘WORKED REGARDLESS OF EXCESSIVE DEATHS,’ its architect says

They appear to have found a Swedish Guardian reader, one Bjorn Olsen of Uppsala University. Olsen, taking the 7.3 percent antibody result at face value, and being a man of some education, has calculated that this is rather far away from the 50 or 60 percent required for herd immunity. “I think herd immunity is a long way off,” tooted the professor of infectious medicine.

But Sweden is not aiming for herd immunity, as their state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell keeps telling people. They are simply ensuring that hospitals do not become overwhelmed, rather than being scared of the second wave. You know, as was the point all along. When, by the way, did that go out the window? Wasn’t all of this done on the pretext of not inundating hospitals with too many patients at once?

Less rationalism, please

I’ll give them this: the Guardian has a knack of unearthing quirky opinions. Another of their popular Sweden articles, which almost has to be read to be believed, is by Tae Hoon Kim, a South Korean based in Stockholm. Kim moans that he is “worried” and “not reassured” by the Swedish government’s virus-wrangling.

Kim also thinks that Sweden’s “tendency to regard coronavirus just as a serious public health problem… something that requires the careful observance of rules set out by health experts” has got them into trouble. Instead, he prefers to think of the loop of RNA as “an ‘invisible enemy’… an existential problem that calls for the state to suspend civil liberties.”

Also on rt.com Why is the MSM working overtime to try to show that Covid-19 is dangerous to CHILDREN - when so few of them have died?

Perhaps Kim would feel more comfortable in, er, I don’t know, South Korea? There, the government would know his exact whereabouts at all times via a compulsory app on his phone, and he would have to tell them the nature of his business everywhere he went. But what do I know? Maybe Kim is right, and we do need more woo-woo philosophizing and op-ed psychobabble. Perhaps a few more celebrity renditions of Kumbaya? As long as we’re spitballing…

Swedes 1, Turnips 0

It is remarkable that even in a year with no Eurovision, Sweden has managed to make such a splash in the Western media. It is fascinating to watch them tie themselves in knots as they try to reconcile their image of Sweden as a progressive paradise with their new notion of a Scandinavian banana republic running a callous Darwinian experiment in which the old are sacrificed for the empty pleasures of the young.

Oh, how the MSM would have loved it if the one country to deviate from conventional wisdom had been Hungary, or the Philippines, or best of all, Russia. How much easier the smear job would have been had it been some poor, backward Latin American or Asian country, or anywhere run by a “literally Hitler” strongman-type politician. But they had no such luck; sensible, freethinking Sweden had to go and deviate from the party line.

No matter how much the MSM bury their heads in the sand, Sweden is running the safest, most responsible reaction to the outbreak in a world gone mad. The real experimenters are the lockdown evangelists. They are the ones playing with people’s lives, and it is high time they accepted that responsibility.

Her website is here and you can follow her on Twitter @caitoz

Anti-Beijing sentiment is being deliberately whipped up by an imperialist America, its supine allies and supportive media oligarchs. But it’s just self-serving propaganda that needs to be called out.

China is in the news every day now. Today here in Australia, we’re pretending to be offended because a Chinese tabloid published the accusation that our nation is a “giant kangaroo that serves as a dog of the US,” even though we all know that’s completely true and we should be flattered that at least they said “giant.”

Before that, we were getting indignant over a hefty barley tariff in response to our facilitation of America’s global anti-China spin campaign, which it turns out Washington screwed us on.

Also on rt.com ‘GIANT KANGAROO’ acting as ‘dog of the US’: Chinese newspaper mocks Australia amid trade row

Anti-China sentiment has been thriving in Australia, aided by our Murdoch-dominated news media, State Department-funded think tanks explicitly geared toward manipulating the China narrative, and of course our own deep-seated racism and xenophobia.

Because of its geographical location, the US military/intelligence asset conventionally known as Australia has been a major focal point for the US-centralized empire’s propaganda campaign against the most powerful unabsorbed nation in the world.

China is in the news constantly now, and it’s not because of any virus. It’s not because of Hong Kong, it’s not because of Uighurs, it’s not because of intellectual property violations or any of the other scattershot, unrelated hodgepodge of excuses you’re being fed as to why the Chinese government must be regarded as the latest Actual Hitler all of a sudden.

China is in the news all the time because of imperialism.

To understand what’s going on with China and why the “news” media keep punching you in the face with stories about how awful it is, you really only need to grasp two basic points:

Point 1: We are in the middle of a slow-motion third world war between the US-centralized power alliance and the nations which have resisted being absorbed into it.

A loose alliance of nationless oligarchs who use governments as weapons have secured control over a large empire-like cluster of nations with economic and military might loosely centralized around the United States. In order to gain more power and ensure its ongoing hegemony, this oligarchic empire must keep expanding by absorbing more nations and brutalizing them if they resist. China is by far the most powerful of the unabsorbed nations, followed by Russia at a distant second and Iran at a distant third.

Nuclear weapons make another hot world war undesirable, so this one takes the form of resource control, economic warfare, staging coups, arming oppositional militias to use as proxy armies, expanding military presence in key geostrategic regions under the pretense of fighting terrorism, and “humanitarian interventionism,” with old-school full-scale ground invasions used only as a last resort, and only after manufacturing sufficient international approval to ensure the continued cohesion of the empire-like power alliance.

But the end goal is the same as that of a conventional world war: to beat the other side into submission and compliance. And, in this case, absorption into the imperial blob. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the prevailing orthodoxy in US power structures became that the US must maintain unipolar hegemony at all cost to maintain a “liberal world order” (even if it means abandoning “liberal” values whenever it’s convenient). From that point on, the agenda has been global domination and the slow, suffocating subversion of anyone who gets in the way.

Point 2: Propaganda is used to move this world war along.

In a conventional war, each side has clear military objectives that everyone understands, and the weapons are naturally moved around in accordance with these objectives. In this weird slow-motion world war, nobody understands what’s going on besides the major power players and those who are paying very close attention.

The various agendas against the governments of Iran, Venezuela, Russia, Syria, China, etc. appear different and unrelated when looked at individually, and indeed you will see different political factions supporting some of these agendas but not others. The only thing unifying this slow-motion movement toward the destruction and absorption of all unabsorbed nations is carefully constructed propaganda narratives.

The way these unifying propaganda narratives operate is simple. It would never occur to rank-and-file citizens that a nation on the other side of the planet that’s pretty much just doing its own thing needs to be sanctioned, subverted and brought to heel, so the imperialist oligarchs who own the political/media class make sure everyone is fed custom-made narratives according to their own ideological echo chamber to prevent any domestic inertia from being thrown on these agendas.

Also on rt.com Is the US abandoning its war on Iran to focus directly on the so-called China threat?

Once there’s sufficient agreement that Saddam/Gaddafi/Morales/Assad/Maduro/whomever must go, the campaign to subvert, sabotage and absorb that government can safely be escalated.

If you can understand points one and two, you can understand everything that’s happening with China, and everything that will continue to happen. Propaganda narratives will be rolled out with increasing aggression which have the long-term goal of alienating China from its allies, hurting its economic interests, and preventing its rise to true superpower status and creating a multipolar world.

And the funny thing is, none of this is necessary. Westerners have been deliberately propagandized into believing that China wants to take over the world and will do so unless kept in line by the United States, which has surrounded China with military bases in an act of extreme aggression that the US itself would never tolerate from any unabsorbed government. But if you really grill people on how they know that China wants to take over the world, you’ll find they don’t have any substantial evidence for it.

They’ll tell you that China has an authoritarian government which persecutes ethnic and religious minorities, wrongly claiming that this means they want to take over the world and inflict the same on everyone else. They’ll tell you China has sought to expand control over some directly adjacent territories, wrongly claiming that this means they want to dominate the planet militarily like the US currently does.

They’ll cite evidence which shows China is seeking to become a superpower and create a multipolar world (something China openly admits) and wrongly claim that this is proof that they are seeking to dominate the world with unipolar hegemony.

They won’t be able to produce any actual, hard evidence that China is trying to take over the world and censor your internet and take away your rights, because no such evidence exists. It’s a completely empty belief arising from aggressive narrative manipulation.

“One myth I think really that needs to be dispelled is that somehow China is aiming to replace America and going to run the world, and it’s not,” said Chinese venture capitalist and social scientist Eric Li on the John Pilger documentary The Coming War on China. “First of all, the Chinese are not that stupid. The West, with its Christian roots, are about converting other people into their beliefs. The Chinese are not about that. It’s just that — again, I’m not degrading the Western culture, I’m just pointing out the inherent nature, the DNA of two different cultures — the Chinese two thousand years ago built the Great Wall to keep the barbarians out, not to invade them.”

I’d say this is a reasonable summary. After European nations tried to conquer the planet just a few generations ago in the name of spreading Christianity and “civilization,” we’re projecting our sick vestigial colonialist values on a nation whose culture never drove it to such madness.

Also on rt.com 3 heavyweights in the ring: As US-China hostility escalates, what role will be played by the world’s other great power, Russia?

Violently dominating the entire planet for all eternity on the vague suspicion that another country wants to do the same to you is not sane, and is not an option. Unabsorbed nations should be allowed to remain unabsorbed, absorbed nations should have their sovereignty restored (or in Australia’s case, granted to it for the first time since its existence as a nation), and America should begin acting like a normal country.

The notion of “pre-crime” is the purview of dystopian horror fiction when applied to individual people, and there’s no reason we should find the prospect of attacking and destroying for hypothetical future offenses any less insane on an international scale.

There was never any reason for the coronavirus to be made into an issue of international conflict when it could just as easily be an issue of international collaboration, and indeed collaborating is what we should all be doing, with this virus and with everything else. Let’s end this weird slow-motion world war and move toward sanity.

is an Irish journalist, commentator, and writer at RT. Previously based in Amsterdam, he wrote for DutchNews and a scatter of local and national newspapers.

Supermarket shelves are empty and slaughterhouses are cesspits of disease. With the coronavirus breaking supply chains, the New York Times has proclaimed the ‘End of Meat’. Why do these people only deal in absolutes?

“Meat comes with uniquely wonderful smells and tastes,” author Jonathan Safran Foer wrote in the New York Times on Thursday, “with satisfactions that can almost feel like home itself.”

Yet, he continued, these satisfactions won’t be with us much longer. Raising livestock is bad for the environment, slaughterhouse workers are getting sick in record numbers, factory farming is cruel and inhumane, and vegetarianism is healthier and cheaper. And, because this is the New York Times, a meat-based diet is also racist, given the fact that the workers who prepare America’s steaks and sausages are overwhelmingly black and brown.

Also on rt.com Big Ag break-up? Senators target America’s meat monopolies, as virus threatens shortages

He’s right on some counts. The evils of factory farming are well-documented, and ought to horrify anyone with a shred of humanity. Chickens shouldn’t be so genetically modified that their brief existence is spent in agonizing pain. Pigs, who have emotions every bit as complex as dogs, shouldn’t be confined to iron prisons

Furthermore, the consolidation of America’s meatpacking industry is bad for animals and farmers alike. Four companies now handle 85 percent of all beef production in the US, and three of these firms control 63 percent of the country’s pork production.

The companies – Tyson Foods, Cargill, the Brazilian-owned JBS S.A., and the Chinese-owned Smithfield – have been criticized before for underpaying farmers and workers, and for horrific abuse at their plants.

Elite nonsense

Yet the notion that a vegetarian or vegan diet would usher in a bright new future is elite nonsense. Saying this is not ""industry propaganda,"" despite what he argues.

Factory meat is bad. Mass production of meat is bad. We need more humane agricultural. Being vegan isn't a solution. https://t.co/SRbw4fu1GD — Black Midwife 🇳🇬 (@SassyE) May 21, 2020

Not going to read ""The End of Meat is Here,"" because it's not. I live in an agricultural farming valley. We have access to locally sourced beef and poultry, direct from the farmers who raise them. Totally cool w/ factory farming going the way of the dinosaur, but meat isn't over. — Vert DuFerk 🔥🌹❤️🇺🇸 (@VertDuFerk) May 21, 2020

Safran Foer claims that adopting such a diet would be cheap. Citing a 2015 study, he claims that “a vegetarian diet is $750 a year cheaper than a meat-based diet.” What he didn’t explain is that the vegetarian diet studied by researchers was dreamed up by one of the researchers themselves in the 1990s as a weight-loss program that substituted olive oil for meat.

Meat may be murder, but an oil-based slimming diet is torture, and all but the most masochistic would gladly pay a premium to get their protein from animals.

Also on rt.com Abolish family, eat bugs, inject female hormones: Covid-19 is Christmas for liberal control-freaks

Environmentally, the vegan future isn’t as green as its proponents like to make out. Demand for avocados, soy and palm oil has accelerated deforestation around the world. A 2016 study found that if humanity switched over to a vegan diet, we wouldn’t be able to sustain as many people, while another group of researchers caused a stir in 2018 when they found that removing livestock from fields would have “devastating” consequences on biodiversity and nutrition.

Even the Guardian, the torchbearer of all things liberal, ran a column in 2018 arguing that, “Rather than being seduced by exhortations to eat more products made from industrially grown soya, maize and grains, we should be encouraging sustainable forms of meat and dairy production based on traditional rotational systems.”

Eating meat is ‘racist’

But you should just shut up and drink the oil, you Nazi, because eating meat is racist. By continuing to demand meat, consumers are putting the “overwhelmingly brown and black” slaughterhouse workers of America at risk of catching the coronavirus, not to mention the occupational hazards that go along with working in the meat industry, Safran Foer argues.

As well as hiring America’s black underclass, the meatpacking industry depends on the labor of illegal immigrants. Nearly a third of all slaughterhouse workers are illegal immigrants who work for a third less than their American counterparts, but you won’t find the New York Times advocating for tougher border controls. That would be racist, by its own rules.

Man did not fight his way to the top of the food chain... to eat vegetables.So everybody spouting ""The End of Meat Is Here"" to tug on heartstrings while they do mental gymnastics to somehow virtue signal about “justice,” can have several seats.Now gimme some chicken! 🍗🍗🍗 — Errol Webber For Congress (CA-37) (@ErrolWebber) May 21, 2020

New York Times is promoting an article called ""The End of Meat Is Here"".The end of meat is not here. We can eat what we want. It’s a free country. — Dean Browning (R) PA-7 (@DeanBrowningPA) May 21, 2020

Instead, the paper went with its tried and true approach of shaming its white liberal readership, appealing to their overdeveloped guilt complexes. Likewise, arguing in favor of raising wages and improving welfare – incremental change – won’t grab headlines like ‘The End of Meat is Here’ does.

The dichotomy is false. Instead of choosing between industrial murder-factories and vegetarian utopia, there are several ways that America’s meat supply-line can be overhauled. First of all, the meat processing monopolies could be broken up. These firms can effectively dictate prices to farmers, ensuring that only the biggest, industrial farming operations can survive. Just last month, a pair of US senators urged the Federal Trade Commission to do just this.

Additionally, US Department of Agriculture regulations could be relaxed to allow farmers to sell their animals to small-scale local producers. At present, slaughterhouses need to have a USDA inspector on site, and only the largest facilities can afford to do this.

Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie wrote a bill aimed at undoing these regulations several years ago, and in light of the recent spate of slaughterhouse sicknesses, has again tried to push it through Congress.

Also on rt.com With economic crisis looming EU overlords legalize food made from worms & baby crickets. Are they going to serve that in Brussels?

Paying more for meat

Smaller-scale and more humane meat production would increase prices, as would new welfare legislation. However, it’s far more likely that consumers would pay more for their meat than wipe it off their plates entirely. Tough new animal welfare laws would be infinitely more palatable than a grains, beans ‘n’ oil diet.

A better world is a matter of will. While vegans will argue that all animal consumption is ethically wrong, the vast majority of the public like hamburgers, steaks and a Sunday roast.

These same people aren’t racist or classist, and likely care on some level about the welfare of animals. It shouldn’t be difficult to strike a balance.

In the meantime, a columnist telling the public “you have to stop eating animals” isn’t going to achieve anything, bar earning the Times a few more clicks.

According to Invitro, 47% of those tested were from Moscow or the Moscow Region, and 14.6% were in the Northwestern Federal District, where Saint Petersburg is located. In the future, Invitro plans to launch a ‘Covid Index’ on its website, which would display data by city, gender, and age.

In their press release, Invitro explained that antibody testing can provide a more reliable indication of the extent of the pandemic.

On May 15, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin announced that the capital city would be rolling out a vast random screening program. According to the mayor, mass testing will enable the government to make more informed decisions about anti-coronavirus measures.

On Wednesday, Russia recorded its first day of more Covid-19 recoveries than new cases, and the prime minister now believes Russia has hit its peak.

According to official statistics published by the Russian government, 9,262 Covid-19 patients beat the virus in the last 24 hours, and 8,764 people were diagnosed. The latest daily number of recoveries is the highest on record, and the tally of newly confirmed cases represents the lowest increase since May 1.

The latest numbers are a positive trend, and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin believes that Russia is reaching the peak of the burden placed on its healthcare system by the virus.

“The situation is gradually stabilizing, especially in Moscow, which was the first to face a new infection,” he said.

According to the prime minister, it is now possible for some parts of the country to start removing restrictive measures. Thus far, 14 of Russia’s 85 regions have already begun to ease restrictions.

“All relevant services and authorities in the regions must constantly keep the situation under control and prevent its deterioration, so that if necessary, they can respond immediately,” he explained.

Despite figures moving in the right direction, the situation might not be all rosy. On Wednesday, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin declared that he expects the death rate in May to be higher than in April.

“There are seriously ill people in hospitals, including in intensive care, for two to three weeks. On the one hand, this accumulating volume creates a great burden on the health system, and on the other hand [it] generates a high mortality rate, which will be significantly higher in May than in April,” he said.

In total, 308,705 cases of Covid-19 have been detected in Russia, with 85,392 patients recovering and 2,972 passing away. 1,726 (58%) of those deaths were in Moscow.

The collapse of oil prices at the start of March after Russia withdrew from the OPEC+ deal was a disaster for Moscow, which remains heavily reliant on oil exports to fund the budget.

But then an odd thing happened: the price of oil lost 56 percent of its value in the year to date, as of May 7, but the ruble is down by only 19 percent over the same period. Like some Tibetan monetary monk, the ruble’s value has managed to levitate and stay up, even as the oil-price ground fell away from underneath it.

Also on rt.com Once he recovers from Covid-19, PM Mishustin faces new ordeal – reviving economy & Kremlin’s popularity with thinning oil kitty

The ruble’s value has long been tied to the price of oil and the two used to move in lockstep. That changed when the Russian Ministry of Finance introduced the so-called budget rule (aka the financial rule), which automatically siphons off any excess oil-export revenue to the National Welfare Fund (NWF) for all revenues earned from oil prices over US$42.

That rule led to the buildup of the reserve fund, which held 12 trillion rubles, or 11 percent of GDP as of April 1, and helped bring down inflation to post-Soviet lows, but, most importantly, largely broke the tie between the ruble’s value and the price of oil.

That has changed now. Since oil prices have fallen below the key US$42 for a cost of a barrel of oil threshold, the budget rule doesn’t make any difference anymore, so oil prices and the value of the ruble should re-engage.

The average value of the ruble in 2018 was 62.7 rubles to the dollar, while the average price of oil was US$70.8. In 2019, the price of oil fell 11.4 percent to US$62.7, while the value of the ruble fell by less, down only 3.2 percent to 64.7, mainly thanks to the steadying effect of the budget rule.

Also on rt.com Covid-19 quarantine could cost Russia $242 BILLION as oil price fall starts to hit budget income

But the changes in the first four months of 2020 have been a lot more dramatic. The average price of oil has shrunk by a third (31.2 percent) to US$43.1 over the first four months – including January and February, when oil prices were US$63.7 and US$55.7 respectively— whereas the average value of the ruble over this period was 68.7 to the dollar, down by only 6 percent.

Even in March and April, the peak of the crisis, the average cost of oil dropped to US$32 and then US$21.2, respectively, or by another quarter (25.8 percent), followed by another collapse by a third (33.6 percent) the following month, but the value of the ruble in those two months was 73.7 and 75.2, down by 7.3 percent in March and a mere 1.9 percent in April.

That’s not to say the ruble has not been battered by the current crisis, which is considered the worst since 1998’s total meltdown of Russia’s financial system, as the chart of the weekly exchange rates of ruble vs dollar shows. But how can the value of the ruble in Russia’s petro-dependent economy defy gravity so easily?

CBR to the rescue

One of the reasons why Russia is expected to weather this crisis a lot better than many of its emerging-markets peers is that Central Bank of Russia (CBR) governor Elvira Nabiullina allowed the ruble to float freely as part of her response to the 2014 oil shock, when oil prices collapsed the last time.

As bne IntelliNews has argued elsewhere, the Kremlin is fixated on preserving Russia’s foreign exchange reserves, which totaled US$569.7 billion as of April 1, because it regards them as a strategic asset. The size of Russia’s reserves means it is impervious to sanctions as it can simply buy its way out of trouble if the US imposes harsh sanctions, without the need to borrow on the international capital markets that would make it vulnerable to sanction pressure.

The CBR has shown it’s prepared to allow the exchange rate to take the brunt of the oil shock to preserve those reserves, and has not been defending its currency, unlike many countries, Turkey notable among them, that have also seen their currencies collapse. Moreover, the money in the NWF also won’t be used to defend the ruble as that money is solely tasked with supporting the budget and covering the 3–4 trillion-ruble federal budget deficit expected this year.

During the 2014 oil-price shock, the ruble also tanked, and by a lot more. Before that crisis, it had been trading at about 35 rubles to the dollar for several years, but it suddenly dropped to a nadir of circa 80 to the dollar.

Investors freaked out and called Nabiullina reckless and incompetent, but then, as now, she refused to burn through Russia’s reserves to defend an indefensible exchange rate.

That crisis started in October and peaked in December, when the CBR finally imposed a 17 percent emergence rate hike on December 16, 2014 to put a floor under the collapse of the currency. The ruble has lost a lot less value than it did in those few months in 2014, which has meant both the investors and the population have greeted this crisis with greater calm than in 2014. And it also means the economic damage done by this crisis – as far as currency effects are concerned – is mild by comparison.

Amazingly, unlike 2014, when the CBR made the biggest one-off rate hike in Russian history, the CBR actually cut rates by an aggressive 50bp at its last policy meeting in April to 5.5 percent, in an effort to give the economy a growth-boosting shot in the arm. April’s cut in rates demonstrates an entirely different mindset.

Usually, during a crisis, emerging-market central banks are forced to hike rates to protect their currency, as Russia did in 2014, whereas developed-market economies cut them to boost growth. And, indeed, the first thing the US Federal Reserve did in April was cut US interest rates to zero.

Nabiullina had a difficult choice in April, as she could have gone both ways: cut rates to boost growth, or hike rates to head off inflation caused by the devaluation of the ruble. But it is a testimony to the effective management of Russia’s central bank since she took over in 2013 that she had a choice, and ended up choosing the developed market’s response to a nasty external shock.

Defending the ruble

The CBR abandoned the “ruble exchange rate corridor” at the end of 2014 – a mechanism that had been in place for almost two decades and obliged it to manage the value of the ruble’s value and stop rapid devaluations.

Russia’s reserves fell this year from a peak of just over US$580 billion to just under US$570 billion as of the start of April, but most of that fall is due to foreign-exchange revaluation effects of the assets the CBR uses to hold Russia’s reserves. The CBR has spent a mere circa US$2 billion of actual cash in the past month in money-market interventions to smooth out the fall in the ruble’s value, which is very little.

Indeed, astonishingly, Russia’s reserves have actually increased this year, by just over US$7 billion from US$562.3 billion, as of January 1. The reserves fell slightly from US$570.3 billion in February to US$563.4 billion in March, but, amazingly, then grew again in April to the current US$569.7 billion.

The CBR will not touch Russia’s foreign-exchange reserves to defend the value of the ruble, and it can’t use the money in the NWF either, which technically belong to the Ministry of Finance. However, the government has come up with a dodge to make more dollars available to the CBR to defend the ruble, which explains its gravity-defying performance over the past two months.

On April 11, the CBR rushed through a deal to sell its 50 percent+1 stake in the state-owned retail banking giant Sberbank to the Ministry of Finance for 2.14 trillion rubles (US$29.1 billion). The change of ownership solves several problems in one go. First, the central bank was in the uncomfortable position of both being the banking-sector regulator and the owner of by far the largest bank in the sector. Now that bank is owned by the Ministry of Finance, which is how it should be.

Second, the deal will put more money into the budget. Sberbank is the most profitable bank in the sector, and recently promised to increase its dividend payments to 50 percent of its income, because the government increasingly uses dividends to tap the profits of its best companies, rather than taxes. However, the CBR regularly held back part of those payments to keep on its own balance sheet.

Now, all of Sberbank’s dividends will be paid directly into the budget. Third, the deal, in effect, provides a back-door route for the CBR to tap the NWF, giving it cash to spend in the money markets to defend the ruble. The Ministry of Finance paid for the deal using NWF money, which has now dropped to about 9 trillion rubles.

This last point is key, as the CBR’s alternative to holding up the ruble’s value was to hike rates again, which would have killed off whatever growth the Russian economy is due to put in during its recovery from April’s crash.

Just how the CBR will use this money remains unclear, but the US$29 billion it now has is thought to be enough to defend the ruble until September, by which time the government hopes the situation will have stabilized and oil prices will have recovered enough to take the pressure off the government’s finances, especially after the OPEC++ production-cut deal that will reduce production of oil by 9.7mbpd and was signed on April 13.

“The CBR will be gradually selling [the US$29bn] until the end of September, [as long] as the price of Urals stays below US$25 a barrel,” Ivan Tkachev, the economics editor of RBC, said in a recent article.

“Since the onset of these interventions, the [Russian benchmark blend] Urals price has never exceeded the threshold, and the CBR sold more than US$2 billion in April. The more Russian oil deviates from US$25, the higher the amount of currency sold by the CBR. Thus, the central bank is effectively compensating for the shortfall of export earnings, supplying the domestic market with that amount of currency as if the Urals price was US$25.”

The CBR’s currency sales will automatically protect the ruble from depreciating too much while oil prices stay low, and buys the government five months of time for the worst effects of the crisis to fade. At US$25 per barrel, the estimated fair value of the ruble is 75–76 rubles to the dollar, estimates Tkachev.

The price of Brent was US$30.97 as of May 9 and the value of the ruble was 73.4 rubles – slightly better than Tkachev’s lower band estimate of oil and exchange-rate forecasts. And the Sberbank money is not the only resources that the government has brought to the ruble’s defense. In addition to the CBR’s own operations, the Ministry of Finance also sells currency on the money markets. The CBR’s statistics aggregate data on both mechanisms, since it’s the CBR, which is the currency sales agent in both cases, says Tkachev.

“Unlike the CBR’s variable sales, the Finance Ministry’s operations are fixed one month in advance. In April, its daily foreign-currency sales amount to the equivalent of 3.5 billion rubles (circa US$46 million). But from March 10, when the CBR launched currency interventions on behalf of the Ministry of Finance, until April 22, more than US$5 billion was sold using both channels,” says Tkachev.

The sale of dollars under the fiscal rule is not happening, as oil prices are under the key US$42 per barrel level. However, on May 8, the CBR formalized an informal ‘auxiliary fiscal rule.’ The CBR announced that it will intervene in the foreign-exchange markets when Russia’s Urals blend of oil (which usually costs about US$2 less than Brent) drops below US$25.

That means the CBR will sell an additional US$0.5– 1.5 billion on the open market for every US$5/bbl decline in the Urals oil price below the lower threshold, analysts at VTB Capital estimate.

“That’s the main reason the ruble has not followed oil prices down in their dramatic plunge,” says Tkachev.

One of the greatest cons perpetrated by some elements in the Western press and the think-tank racket is that they genuinely care about the average Russian person. But in the time of coronavirus, the mask has truly slipped.

As the worldwide pandemic rages, you'd expect that the usual suspects would lay off vilification of “the Russians.” Unfortunately, it seems precisely the opposite is happening, with a particular cohort finding great amusement in suicide attempts by Russian doctors. Seemingly, the plight of medical staff and their ever-worsening mental health is cause for jesting and joking – all because of their nationality.

Last week, Russian media reported that a third medical worker in less than a fortnight had fallen to the ground from the window of a building. At the time of writing, two are confirmed dead, and the other is in intensive care, but now conscious and breathing on his own.

As news of the incident emerged, media from around the world began drumming up conspiracy theories, with Vox asking, “Is the Russian government surreptitiously killing people who speak out about the failures of the country’s coronavirus response?”

Vox's cast of conspiracy-peddling characters includes Alina Polyakova of the Center for European Policy Analysis, a lobby group funded by weapons manufacturers, the US-government, and NATO. “I would not be surprised if the security services were involved, sending a message to keep quiet on the crisis,” she said.

The reality is, in fact, much more tragic.

On April 24, Natalya Lebedeva, head of the emergency medical department in Star City, outside Moscow, fell to her death from a hospital window, where she had been hospitalized herself with suspected Covid-19. Star City is a small and closed community, home to Russia’s military research and space training facility.

According to the newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets, Lebedeva’s colleagues suspect she committed suicide due to accusations from her superiors that she had not taken sufficient measures to ensure the safety of her employees, and had subsequently allowed several medical workers to become infected. Officials claim it was an accident and say it is being investigated.

One day later, on April 25, Elena Nepomnyashchaya, the acting head physician of the Krasnoyarsk Regional Hospital for War Veterans, fell from her office window. Krasnoyarsk is a city in East Siberia, over 3,000km away from Moscow.

According to local news outlet TVK Krasnoyarsk, Nepomnyashchaya’s fall occurred after a conference call with the head of the regional Ministry of Health, Boris Nemik, in which they were discussing how the hospital could be re-profiled to accept coronavirus patients. Nepomnyashchaya allegedly opposed the intake of those infected with Covid-19, believing it did not have enough personal protective equipment (PPE). Nemik denies this call ever happened. On May 1, Nepomnyashchaya died in intensive care.

The third incident followed a week later. On May 2, ambulance doctor Alexander Shulepov fell from the window of the Novousmansky District Hospital in the Voronezh Region, 470km south of Moscow. Unlike the other two medics, Shulepov is still alive.

Shulepov’s story is by far the most complicated of the three. Prior to his fall, the doctor had published a video, complaining that he was being forced to work after a Covid-19 diagnosis, and exposing a shortage of PPE.

As of now, nobody knows precisely what happened to Shulepov, but there are indications his fall was either an attempted suicide or an accident. As he fell from a window on the first floor of a building, it’s highly unlikely this was a murder attempt – after all, it’s probable that someone would survive a fall from such a low height. According to local news outlet RIA Voronezh, the most likely cause was that he slipped while smoking a cigarette on the windowsill.

The international reaction to the third fall featured lots of mocking and jeering. Apparently, the death of Russian medical staff is a cause of great hilarity. Nate Schenkkan, the Director for Special Research at US government-funded pressure group Freedom House, thought it funny to sum up the suicide of heavily strained Russian doctors as a “pandemic of defenestration.”

A pandemic of defenestration https://t.co/9NmrWkd9me — Nate Schenkkan (@nateschenkkan) May 4, 2020

The former President of Estonia, Toomas Hendrik Ilves, also deemed what seems to be a mental health crisis to be high-quality comedic material. Later his tweet mocking the suicides was deleted.

The hilarity wasn't just limited to the likes of think-tanks and politicians, of course. The New York Times' former Moscow bureau chief, Neil MacFarquhar, also believed it suitable to make light of the situation.

A doctor not yet fallen out a window — Neil MacFarquhar (@NeilMacFarquhar) May 5, 2020

Unfortunately, Russia's situation seems to be reflective of a grim international trend, in which medical workers from around the world are under constant strain, as the battle to defeat Covid-19 seems never-ending.

In late April, two over-worked American medics committed suicide, both in New York City. Emergency medical technician John Mondello and physician Lorna Breen both suffered under the intense strain of treating patients of Covid-19. In France, Bernard Gonzalez, a medic working with football team Stade Reims, took his own life after contracting coronavirus. Thankfully, these deaths were not mocked.

Many other countries have issues with the mental health of medical professionals, and nobody has believed it suitable to make jokes. That is a treatment reserved exclusively for Russians.

Indeed, it seems like everyone has a free pass when it comes to Russia. In the modern world, where racism, xenophobia, and bigotry are rightly considered disgusting, there's still one final group it's okay to despise. Even amid a global pandemic, there's one thing we're all allowed to do: mock the Russians.

President of the UFC he may be, but White isn’t averse to being the butt of a joke now and then.

He proved that on Saturday when he tweeted a hilarious video at ‘The Notorious’ McGregor, which featured the fiery Dubliner initially as a crocodile menacing the waters before he emerges as a bull raging through the streets, running after spectators and tossing them over walls with big punches - before finally landing a huge right-hook on 50-year-old Dana himself.

It also features a slightly tubby schoolkid sobbing in terror as the Notorious pops up at his car window and screams at him with his famous pre-fight war cry.

All told, it’s been an interesting weekend so far for McGregor, who earlier in the day tweeted out his rankings for the greatest MMA fighter of all time - but didn’t put himself as number one - well, not yet anyway.

Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has given his blessing for the return of football from the week starting June 8 after it had been suspended since mid-March, but football authorities have been assessing the situation in a bid to conclude the campaign should the public health situation allow for it.

La Liga officials have been pushing for a June 12 restart date, and Sanchez's announcement now gives the league a concrete return date to target.

""Spain has done what it should and now new horizons are opening for everyone,"" Sanchez announced on Saturday.

""The time has come to resume many daily activities. From June 8, La Liga will return to football.""

La Liga president Javier Tebas indicated earlier this week that he was confident that the league could return to action shortly, so long as the necessary clearance was given from public health officials - and Sanchez's dictum clears a path for this to become possible.

""But it is very important to follow the sanitary norms and that the evolution of the pandemic respects us, we cannot lower our guard.""

Despite only boasting what could be describing as an average record in the Ultimate Fighting Championship, the 26-year-old VanZant has become one of the faces of the female fight game.

Her profile has grown considerably in recent years owing to being featured on the US version of 'Dancing With The Stars', as well as stripping off for the annual Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition.

However, VanZant has apparently being increasingly of the opinion that her UFC pay-packet doesn't quite match her profile outside of the Octagon and appears keen to demonstrate her value to the organization ahead of an upcoming showdown with the 9-1 Brazilian Amanda Ribas.

It was reported by ESPN that VanZant will take on the surging Ribas on July 11. A location hasn't been officially confirmed, though a post on VanZant's Instagram stated that she will be ""coming to an island near you,"" in an apparent reference to Dana White's novel 'Fight Island' concept.

The UFC president has remained steadfastly tight-lipped as to the specifics of 'Fight Island', but it is thought that the idea will become a reality this summer and is designed as a method to have fighters based within the United States compete against athletes from outside the country as a means to bypass travel restrictions into the country amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.

Injury has kept VanZant out of the cage since a January 2019 win against Rachael Ostovich. She was scheduled to fight Ribas in March before being forced to withdraw with an arm injury, with the Brazilian fighting and defeating Rando Markos in VanZant's place.

The fight will represent that final bout on VanZant's UFC contract, after which she has suggested she will test the free agency market where it is likely she will receive interest from other MMA leagues. However, VanZant's growing reputation - coupled with an impressive performance against Ribas - could force the UFC's hand in handing her an improved deal.

""I want to prove my worth,"" VanZant said last month. ""You truly can’t find what your value is until you’re a free agent. When you’re locked into a contract, the only people that can set your value are the people that you’re signed with.""

""Change is very hard, but I’m looking for the best opportunity for my future and I don’t know what that is,"" she explained.

""I think it’s going to take negotiation with the UFC and negotiations with other organizations to know who’s going to offer me the brighter future. It might come down to other factors outside just a dollar figure. It’s really about who’s going to propel me to the best of their ability.""

VanZant garnered significant attention online in recent months by posting a series of semi-nude photographs alongside her husband, Bellator welterweight prospect Austin Vanderford - and has admitted that the money she receives from Instagram endorsements outstrips that of her UFC deal.

As if the world of sport hadn’t got surreal enough in these unusual times what with spectators being replaced by cardboard cut-outs and sex dolls, fans of one team in Denmark are now able to grab free tickets for their games - and cheer them on inside the ground via online chat platform Zoom.

AGF Aarhus of the Danish Superliga have announced they are erecting giant screens inside 22 sections of their Ceres Park stadium, on which the players will be able to see the faces of watching fans cheering them on from the comfort of their own homes.

The fans will also be able to pick sections when choosing tickets for the upcoming game against their local rivals Randers FC on May 28 that will allow them to ‘sit’ alongside their friends in the Superliga’s first game back since lockdown due to the coronavirus. So while they may not be able to actually go to the stadium, they will be able to ‘gather’ as the match begins.

The screens and technology involved will take 23 people to operate and the sections will be monitored to ensure home, away and neutral fans aren’t located on the same virtual screen. Although you would imagine the prospect of any fights breaking out must be fairly low.

AGF’s CEO Jacob Nielsen certainly seems excited about the project, saying: “It will be the first tournament match in a long time. We are celebrating that with a historic digital initiative, and we are proud to be the first club in the world to use it.

The UFC lightweight champion’s father was feeling ill in Dagestan but faced a long wait before receiving medical attention because of a lack of understanding about the deadly virus in his homeland, Russian MMA promotion Fight Nights Global boss Kamil Gadzhiev has claimed.

Promoter Gadzhiev has said he was in touch with Nurmagomedov before the revered trainer was admitted to the Moscow hospital where he is now on a life support machine, and believes he could have caught COVID-19 as a result of one of the mass events that continued in the country while the outbreak spread.

“We talked when he was ill in Dagestan,” Gadzhiev told Sport Express.

“Abdulmanap did not really receive assistance for ten days. Why didn’t they help? Maybe they didn’t understand that it was COVID. Maybe there were no necessary preparations.

“When we corresponded, the risks of the coronavirus were not yet known – even less so in Dagestan. They were not ready to withstand the coronavirus. Why did he get infected? Probably because of mass events, be it a wedding or a funeral.

“Abdulmanap is one of those people who are very much talked about today in the context of the Dagestan coronavirus as a whole. There are people who have not been given proper medical care. There are almost no people left in Dagestan who have not been affected by the coronavirus.

“This is not the fault of doctors. In general, I won’t specifically blame anyone. I’ll just say that people in our republic treated the virus quite negligently. What happened to Abdulmanap is a certain result of [this], unfortunately.”

is a UK journalist, ex-Fleet Street editor, financial industry consultant and political communications special advisor in the UK and EU.

Feminists on the frontline of gender politics have seized on a poll they helped publish to push their agenda to the fore in a crisis that has wrecked everyone’s economies and lives. Disproportionate male deaths got a side note.

A new poll by IPSOS Mori declares that UK women are bearing the emotional brunt of the coronavirus pandemic. Fair point, but is it sexist to mention that it’s men who actually die more?

In fact, men are almost twice as likely as women to die from the coronavirus, but women, as the study has found, are about 15 to 20 percent more worried about various other aspects of the pandemic.

I get it. The poll was published in conjunction with the Fawcett Society, named for the iconic suffragette Millicent Fawcett, so with a touch of cynicism you’ll see the goal here.

Also on rt.com Covid-19 is a disaster for everyone… except straight white men?

Even though the study mentions up front the fact men are in more danger from disease itself, that mention is nowhere to be found in the headlines on the Fawcett Society (why would it be?), or IPSOS, or the Guardian, which declares: ‘UK women bear emotional brunt of Covid-19 turmoil – poll’ and mentions problems of risk and unemployment they face. Their stories do mention that men are dying disproportionately but hey, women are affected in other ways that aren’t death.

And isn’t that more important? My guess is I’m seen as a man just propagating a culture of male domination, though biased feminist polling is a-okay.

Polls are commissioned to prove a point that needs apparently objective validation. Very rarely does a political outfit pay a polling company without having a fair idea of what the results will be. What they seek is the credibility earned by using an independent polling business that gives the results kudos.

So we have 61 percent of women struggling day to day to stay positive while 47 percent of men admit to feeling the same.

In gender politics the old adage that a woman’s work is never done holds true, particularly when that woman is fighting on the feminist frontline and there’s suddenly an unexpected opportunity to strike a blow against the patriarchal hegemony.

What is conveniently overlooked is that data collection on an issue such as this is skewed by its very nature.

You’re not asking what sort of soap powder an interviewee prefers here, you’re asking men and women how they feel.

And there lies the problem. While women are far more upfront about peaks and troughs in their emotions, a man asked to explain his feelings will do nothing of the sort. Hardwired to put on a front, most blokes will shrug and mumble, “I’m not too worried” even when pushed whether he’s concerned at the death of thousands of his countrymen at the hands of an invisible virus.

It’s not that it isn’t something to bother about or that men are mostly unfeeling, uncaring boneheaded neanderthals, it’s just that the average Joe would rather not discuss his emotions with you and a relatively neutral answer is far more likely to end a line of questioning sooner than if he opened up and blubbed out his darkest nightmares.

So while six out of 10 women admit they are struggling and less than half of men questioned admitted to feeling likewise, it has to be concluded, “Well they would say that!”

It’s people who suffer, not men or women

And it’s not just the elastic treatment of poll results that irritate here, it’s the gender politics at play when it’s really not appropriate.

It’s ‘people’ who are suffering, whose loved ones are dead, jobs lost, schools shut and dreams in tatters.

It’s not a man and woman thing, its humanity as a whole and it is wrong and insensitive to prioritise one group over another, whether they be different sexes, ages, races or religions. But Sam Smethers, the Fawcett Society CEO, has found a man-shaped windmill to tilt at pushing a feminist agenda that somehow men are using the pandemic to assert masculine dominance.

She recently drummed up support from the various members of The Sisterhood to sign a joint statement explaining how bad things are for women in the UK since the pandemic struck.

Also on rt.com The gender sleep gap? Wake me up when the nightmare of modern feminism is over

The statement spoke of women being “largely invisible from the debate and excluded from decision-making,” and many were “trapped in their homes, self-isolating with an abusive partner” as if this was the norm. I found that claim insulting.

It goes on about “specific challenges women are facing,” having “voices heard” and “needs met.” Certainly, interesting ideas to discuss, and there may even be some valid demands in there.

There is no mention anywhere among these concerns about who the majority of victims of the Covid-19 crisis might be.

It’s strange, because they are the grandfathers, fathers, husbands and sons of the gender-obsessed feminist brigade who insist on propagating nonsense like this week’s poll results.

Unlike the superstar basketball player, ESPN’s ‘The Last Dance’ is anything but great. It claims to reveal the man behind the legend – but is actually just a fawning, cultish piece of propaganda.

Michael Jordan is arguably the greatest basketball player of all time, and the much-hyped ESPN 10-part documentary on his career and final championship season with the Chicago Bulls, 'The Last Dance,' which comes to a close this Sunday night, claims to reveal the man behind the legend.

I’ll save you the suspense – spoiler alert – and let you know how the movie ends… the Bulls win a sixth championship and Jordan is never challenged… not on the basketball court. Nor, sadly, in this documentary.

Read more

'The Last Dance' isn’t so much a documentary as a piece of '90s nostalgia porn that serves as an exercise in sports media genuflection in the form of an epic, 10-hour infomercial for the Jordan brand.

The film’s alleged claim to fame is that it reveals never-before-seen footage of Jordan during the Bulls’ 1998 championship run. The problem is that Jordan himself controls the rights to this painfully banal and contrived footage, and in order to use it, producers Michael Tollin and Jon Weinbach, as well as ESPN and Netflix, had to make Jordan’s production company, Jump 23, a co-producer on the project. It all means that His Airness got the last word on what does, and does not, make the final cut of 'The Last Dance.' The result of which is more shameless hagiography than documentary.

As a business decision, ESPN and Netflix undoubtedly made the right one, as the film is being devoured by sports-starved fans in the age of coronavirus, and is a runaway success with sky-high ratings.

As a journalistic decision, though, 'The Last Dance' traded away any semblance of journalistic integrity for the golden goose of access. Whether it is embedded journalists with troops in a warzone, or the press making deals in the halls of power, access to power is always acquiescence to power.

Evidence of which is that the 'The Last Dance' doesn’t try to “Be Like Mike” with his trademark tenacity, instead it goes remarkably soft on its subject, and delicately dances around his pronounced shortcomings.

'The Last Dance' feels like one of those interviews with a politician where they are asked: “What are your greatest weaknesses?” And the politician answers, to much eye-rolling, that they “work too hard and care too much.”

Also on rt.com Michael Jordan reveals he wanted to sign with ADIDAS, not Nike, but said the sportswear giants WEREN'T INTERESTED enough

The docu-series reduces Jordan’s compulsive gambling and toxic personal behavior and bullying of teammates into simply being the result of his maniacal competitiveness. You see, according to 'The Last Dance,' even Jordan’s personal failures are because he is so great.

The film lays it on particularly thick when teammate B.J. Armstrong claims the notoriously bullying Jordan wasn’t exactly a good guy. Jordan self-pityingly responds, in essence, that his being considered “not a nice guy” is the heavy price he had to pay for his greatness. Jordan then breaks down crying and dramatically declares the interview over. Of course, the hapless director, Jason Hehir, doesn’t dare resist his boss.

There is another telling sequence in the film dealing with Scottie Pippen’s “quitting” on his team in the final 1.8 seconds of a playoff game in 1994, when coach Phil Jackson calls on Toni Kukoc for the final shot instead of Pippen. Jordan comments in the doc that the “quitting” incident ""is always going to come back to haunt [Pippen]…”

What is so striking about that sequence is that Jordan wasn’t playing on that Bulls team, he had “retired” at the end of the ‘93 season, supposedly because he was exhausted dealing with the difficulties of superstardom and the omnipresent media.

What did Jordan do in 1994 to escape dealing with fans and the press? Did he go into seclusion? Go fishing? No. He went, with great fanfare, and played minor league baseball, and then 18 months later returned to basketball after the Bulls failed to win a title without him.

Read more

According to Jordan and the decidedly deferential 'The Last Dance,' Pippen quitting on his team for 1.8 seconds means he is forever tarred by it, while Jordan, who quit on his team for a full 18 months, is beyond reproach.

The docu-series doesn’t have the journalistic courage to challenge the myth of Jordan at all. If it attempted to be even mildly adversarial, it might highlight that, unlike Jordan, fellow NBA greats like Magic Johnson (five titles) and Bill Russell (11 titles) weren’t jerks to their teammates, but inspirations.

Or that, unlike say Johnson or Larry Bird, who won titles early in their careers, Jordan had to wait until all the great teams of his time, such as the Celtics, Lakers and Pistons, had aged out of their prime before he could go on his championship run in an NBA greatly watered-down due to expansion in the 90s.

It also fails to notice that Jordan’s greatest moments during his reign came against lowly positional rivals like John Starks, Craig Ehlo and Bryon Russell… not exactly Hall of Famers.

Or that since his retirement, his main claim to fame has been a TV advert for Gatorade entitled Be Like Mike, set to the song from 'The Jungle Book.'

The bottom line is this: Jordan is undeniably one of the most aesthetically and athletically dynamic icons in sports history, but 'The Last Dance' isn’t an investigation or even contemplation of the man and his legacy, but rather a cultish coronation that unquestioningly embraces previously manufactured mythmaking. That’s not sports journalism, it’s self-serving sycophancy, and NBA fans deserve much better.

The young man, who has not been named, was transferred from an Ann Arbor hospital to Detroit’s Westwood Nursing Center last week after contracting the coronavirus, his father told local media. He later appeared in disturbing footage repeatedly punching an elderly man in the face. While the suspect has since been arrested for the assault, it remains unclear how or why he ended up at the nursing home in the first place, given that seniors are among the most vulnerable to the lethal illness.

“He never should have been housed – quarantined – with the victim that he eventually assaulted. That should have never happened,” the man’s father said, adding: “Someone dropped the ball.”

He has [mental] issues and for them to put him in a facility like that, nothing good was going to happen.

Prior to the attack that was captured on video – apparently filmed by the assailant himself – the suspect already faced charges in nearby Washtenaw County, where he is accused of assaulting a staff member at another facility. While acknowledging his son’s severe behavioral and mental problems, the father said he “never would have consented” to sending him to a nursing home had he been informed of it. It is still unknown who made the decision to transfer him there.

Some mystery also surrounds the 75-year-old victim of the nursing home assault. Relatives told local press that they began to worry when they were unable to reach him by phone, explaining that, for reasons that are still unclear, he was taken from his Detroit apartment and brought to the Westwood center. The man is now recovering from his injuries at a nearby hospital.

The incident has sparked widespread outrage, even drawing the attention of US President Donald Trump. The backlash has only been intensified with the latest revelation, prompting a flood of criticism and questions from critics online.

While achingly ‘woke’, it won’t solve the inequality problem.

The ten-campus public university system voted on Thursday to axe the SAT and ACT standardized tests from its admission requirements for the next two years and plans to drop it entirely for in-state students after that.

The move strikes what could very well be a crippling blow to the testing empire that has dominated the highly competitive college admissions landscape for decades, and it’s being hailed by some as a win for diversity and equal opportunity. But not only will it not help disadvantaged students – the only immediate beneficiaries will be the university administrators themselves.

Also on rt.com Fights & arrests as 1000+ antifa-like protesters swarm Ann Coulter event at UC Berkeley (VIDEOS)

The UC Board of Regents’ unanimous decision to drop the tests appears to have been based less in careful evaluation of the potential consequences than in classic “never let a good crisis go to waste” liberal opportunism crossed with a good bit of arse-covering. The Covid-19 pandemic interrupted the 2020 testing schedule, leading UC to cross off test scores as a requirement for 2021 application; the proposal to ditch the scores entirely cited the “likely ongoing impacts” of the pandemic on students and schools. Students can still submit test results, but after 2022, they will no longer even be considered as part of in-state applications. And after that, the state hopes to roll out its own admissions test.

Why now? The UC system was sued in 2019 over the use of standardized test scores in admissions by advocacy groups accusing it of discrimination-by-proxy – using test scores as a stand-in for income, race, and parental education. Citing the words of Governor Gavin Newsom himself, the plaintiffs charged the system with violations of the state equal protection clause and various discrimination codes.

Earlier this week, Alameda County Superior Court Judge Brad Seligman ruled that the case against the UC system could go forward. The timing, it seems, is not a coincidence.

Critics have long decried standardized tests as racist, classist, ableist, and every other PC pejorative in the book. But a study conducted this year by the UC system itself found that minority, low-income and first-generation students were actually admitted at a higher rate than more privileged students with the same test scores.

Perhaps surprisingly, given the prevailing wisdom, those same disadvantaged students’ SAT and ACT scores were better predictors of college success than high-school grades – though students with both high test scores and good grades obviously fared the best. Admissions staff, the study found, were already factoring in outside circumstances in considering applications, and weighting non-test components (extracurriculars, GPA, essays) accordingly.

Essentially, the UC study found that standardized testing does not keep disadvantaged students out of college – and the Board decided to ditch it anyway, because the opportunity presented by the coronavirus was too good to pass up. Scupper looming legislation and appear virtuous?! For all the shiny woke patina of the board’s decision, it’s less about giving poor and minority students a leg up than it is about keeping money in its pockets – and its reputation intact.

Unlike smaller private schools who’ve dropped standardized tests, like Sarah Lawrence and Smith College, UC’s self-serving decision is likely to have a powerful ripple effect. The sheer size of its network – 172,000 students applied for a place in the freshman class in 2019 – translates to unparalleled power in setting educational trends.

The UC system is credited with (or blamed for) bringing the SAT and ACT to national prominence in the first place, and the state’s schools are the largest source of revenue for the College Board, which owns the tests and runs a very lucrative test prep industry. Jettisoning them – and developing its own proprietary test – will save the system a lot of money.

Certainly, standardized testing has taken on far too much significance in the American public school system. Even elementary school kids now spend a sizable chunk of their school year filling in small bubbles on answer sheets, while parents who can afford it splurge on tutors and test prep classes in the hope of giving their child the advantage they need to get into a “good school.” But acing the tests doesn’t require outside preparation – in a functional schooling system, at least, students learn how to read, reason, and do mathematics in class. California, unfortunately, does not have a functional school system.

The College Board – which is admittedly biased – pointed out that inequality begins long before students sit down to take the SATs, countering that their tests weren’t the cause of the problem, but merely shone a light on it. “We must also address the disparities in coursework and classrooms that the evidence shows most drive inequity in California,” the group said in a statement.

With 11 of the 26 worst-performing school districts in the US, the state was actually sued in 2017 for failing to correct a “literacy crisis” that teachers and students in three especially low-performing schools accused of “dragging down the nation.” At its nadir, 96 percent of one Los Angeles school’s students were proficient in neither English nor math.

But doing away with standardized testing is not going to fix that problem. It merely kicks the can down the road, forcing colleges to pick up the slack and teach young adults to read and do basic math. Indeed, ditching the tests opens the door to runaway grade inflation, with nothing to stop poor-performing schools from merely grading their students on a curve and sending their “high achievers” into the UC system whether or not they can read or write.

Prizing a superficially-diverse student body over a competent one ends up disadvantaging everyone in the class: the high achievers lose patience and tune out, the low achievers struggle to keep up (and tune out), and the teacher starts daydreaming about alternate career paths, handing out As and Bs because it’s easier than trying to fix a lifetime of substandard schooling. Graduates – assuming they do graduate – emerge utterly unprepared for the real world. Perhaps the UC system will hire them?

He has a background in the life sciences, and graduated from the University of Glasgow with a degree in genetics

The UK government was one of many that reacted to the coronavirus outbreak based on worst-case scenario predictions. But the author of an alternative model has restated her position, saying the virus is already “on its way out.”

Sunetra Gupta is a professor of theoretical epidemiology at the University of Oxford. Back in March, before the UK’s lockdown, she and her team published a study suggesting that the coronavirus may have infected 50% of the British population back in early March, before the lockdown measures were put in place. The model concluded that continuing on a path toward herd immunity would be the most sensible course of action.

Also on rt.com ‘Humans are not herds’: WHO thrashes ‘brutal arithmetic’ of herd immunity to beat Covid-19 pandemic

Boris Johnson’s government originally chose to aim for a model like Prof. Gupta’s, just as those notorious irrational hotheads the Swedes were. It soon, however, gave in to public (read: Twitter) pressure. Boris called in that professional harbinger of doom, Imperial College’s Neil Ferguson, instead.

A tale of two models

Prof. Ferguson’s model was nothing short of apocalyptic, featuring as it did half a million dead, and bodies piled up in car parks outside hospitals – everything but a yawning crevice in the ground and satyrs raining hell from the sky. So stark was the warning that he seemed to take it to heart, deciding to treasure a few moments with his married mistress while he could. For this small indulgence, he was eventually forced to resign from his post. But his thinking informs the government’s coronavirus policy to this day.

Prof. Gupta’s model, on the other hand, predicted that just 1 in 1,000 of those infected with Covid-19 would need to go to hospital, and possibly an order of magnitude less. This would have placed the true mortality rate at 0.1% or lower, something much more like the flu and much less like a Hollywood disaster movie. Today, almost two months on, the problem with all of this is pretty much the same as it was then: we just don’t have enough information.

One body of evidence that has built up since, however, is a number of studies involving ‘antibody tests’ that have been conducted around the world. The basic idea is that, if you have recovered from Covid-19, your immune system’s battle with the virus will have left a trace of antibodies in your blood.

Assuming that the antibody studies are more or less accurate, it would appear that Ferguson, and not Gupta, was closest to the truth. They show that even in badly hit countries, something like only 5-10% of people have antibodies. So has Professor Gupta repented, pledging allegiance to the new church of Ferguson-ology, whose teachings now determine our lives?

Sticking to her guns

Anything but. In her first interview since the original study was published, Prof. Gupta doubles down on her opinion that the coronavirus is not as bad as all that. Firstly, she reminds us how “a lot of these antibody tests are extremely unreliable.” Like everything with coronavirus, there are caveats attached: we just don’t know how accurately these tests detect antibodies in people who have been infected.

Prof. Gupta also points to the total absence of a pattern across countries with wildly different lockdown strategies as being highly suggestive of “hidden” herd immunity. “In almost every context we’ve seen the epidemic grow, turn around and die away – almost like clockwork. Different countries have had different lockdown policies, and yet what we’ve observed is almost a uniform pattern of behaviour.”

In other words, it doesn’t matter what governments do or not in reaction to the virus, as it had already been spreading freely through their countries for at least a month longer than they had assumed.

Also on rt.com The man behind the UK’s Covid-19 lockdown has screwed his mistress, screwed us all, & now – thankfully – screwed his career

She continues: “To me, that suggests that much of the driving force here was due to the build-up of immunity … I think that the epidemic has largely come and is on its way out in this country.” Prof. Gupta is magnanimous, and while noting that “the jury is still out,” she says Prof. Ferguson’s model, while definitely being a “worst case scenario,” was possible, even if it was not plausible.

As if to put the tin hat on her dismantling of the government’s actions to this point, Prof. Gupta warns that the socially distant lockdowns are in fact precisely the conditions that put more people at risk of dying. “Remaining in a state of lockdown is extremely dangerous from the point of view of the vulnerability of the entire population to new pathogens. Effectively we used to live in a state approximating lockdown 100 years ago, and that was what created the conditions for the Spanish Flu to come in and kill 50 million people.”

The full interview is well worth listening to, especially as Prof. Ferguson is no longer gracing the airwaves with his opinions. His model was done at Imperial College London – a very great university, no doubt. But the modellers at the University of Oxford report are hardly dunces either. Make up your own mind as to who was closer to the truth. Hopefully, history will bear it out; after all, it is usually written by the victors.

Downing Street confirmed on Saturday that Cummings had undertaken the seemingly flagrant lockdown-breaching journey from London to Durham in March, after news of it broke on Friday night.

In a tortured statement, Number 10 contended that, because Cummings’ wife was displaying coronavirus symptoms, the adviser had not broken the guidelines he’d helped to create because it was essential that his young son was looked after by his (Cummings’) elderly parents.

The claim has been met with confusion and anger in the UK as millions of mothers and fathers ask why they were told to keep their children away from their grandparents for more than two months.

Also on rt.com BBC blasted after political editor jumps to defend PM adviser Cummings following cross-country lockdown breach

The government’s claim appears to hold little water for Durham’s police chief as he slammed Cummings’ actions as ""most unwise"" and “concerning.”

“Given the whole ethos of the guidance and regulations issued from the Government was to reduce the spread, regardless of reason, by travelling to County Durham when known to be infected was most unwise,” acting Durham police commissioner Steve White said in a statement on Saturday.

To beat this crisis, we need to be selfless as millions have been. The response by the people of County Durham and Darlington have been exemplary, which makes this most frustrating and concerning.

The BBC has also come under fire for its reporting of the fiasco, with political editor Laura Kuenssberg accused of acting as a spokesperson for the government.

Children in foster care may be vaccinated without a court order, against parental wishes, because vaccination is not considered a “serious medical treatment” that would justify High Court intervention, a three-judge appeals court panel ruled on Friday. Absent any “significant” or “unusual” reason a shot might not be in the child’s “best interests,” the London Borough of Tower Hamlets had full authority to arrange for a nine-month-old child in foster care to be vaccinated, the judges said in their decision.

Also on rt.com Italy in shock as mayor, medics & others caught brainwashing kids to sell them into foster care

The child was taken from his parents in September and placed into care after the government – which had previously removed children from the home due to the “parents’ chaotic lifestyle,” violence, and neglect – deemed his living conditions unsafe. While the parents had refused to have the child vaccinated, declaring the state should have no role in the raising of their son, they lost their initial case in February.

After an appeals hearing last month, the parents had already acquiesced to the state’s wishes, apparently seeing the writing on the wall and opting to allow their son to be vaccinated. However, the ruling is likely to have repercussions far beyond that case as the UK fast-tracks several Covid-19 vaccines to market.

Infant vaccinations are not mandatory in the UK, but the judges pointed out in their ruling that there was no precedent for a vaccination dispute being decided against inoculating the child and scientific opinion was largely settled in favor of the risks of not vaccinating outweighing any potential vaccine risks. Indeed, a 1989 law specifically categorizes the jabs as “preventative healthcare” rather than “medical treatment” and permits the state to arrange inoculations for children in care without consulting their parents. While parental wishes on immunization “must always be taken into account,” they can be put aside “unless the view has a real bearing on the child’s welfare,” the judges concluded.

The decision will likely have some parents up in arms, especially as the UK rushes various Covid-19 vaccines through trials despite a lackluster showing in clinical trials so far. Oxford University’s vaccine failed to prevent viral infection in any of the six rhesus monkeys that had been inoculated in its initial trial earlier this week, but the government dumped another £65.5 million ($80 million) into that project and human trials of the formulation will apparently continue despite the flop. On Thursday, drugmaker AstraZeneca said it had secured orders for 400 million doses of the unproven Oxford jab, with plans to start delivering it as early as September.

Also on rt.com The more you know? Over a third of Americans apprehensive about Covid-19 vaccine, citing rushed development & trust issues

The UK has an especially poor history with vaccines being rushed to market – the government is still paying out reparations for citizens injured by the 2009 Pandemrix vaccine, which hit the market during a swine flu epidemic after just six months of safety testing. The shot left over 1,000 people, mostly children, with permanent brain damage.

No statements have been made yet as to whether the coronavirus vaccine will be mandatory, but a significant minority of respondents to polls in the US and France have balked at both the rushed development timetable – vaccines usually take upwards of 10 years to go through clinical trials and safety testing – and their respective governments’ politicization of the process.

The strict regulation has been a key feature of coronavirus-mitigating restrictions imposed by countries around the globe, including the UK. In what was perhaps an attempt to communicate the physical distancing rule in a more relatable way, the PM’s office tweeted on Friday: “Keep 2 metres apart when you go outside. That’s 1 bed; 2 benches; 3 fridges; 4 chairs.”

Keep 2 metres apart when you go outside. That’s:🔴 1 bed🔴 2 benches🔴 3 fridges🔴 4 chairs#StayAlert — UK Prime Minister (@10DowningStreet) May 22, 2020

It’s safe to say the majority of the British public on social media were left either perplexed or incredibly amused – in some cases, both – by the peculiar comparisons. Many leapt on the suggestion to keep “3 fridges” apart, with one commenter asking: “Who owns 3 fridges that they can carry around with them?”

Others referenced PM Boris Johnson, who was accused of hiding in a giant fridge to avoid questions from the media while out on his 2019 general election campaign, with one commenter jokingly asking: “Are those fridges the small under-the-counter ones or the ones big enough for a man to hide in?”

There were even some rather morbid suggestions for alternative objects to use as measuring devices, such as “1 coffin.” Conversely, humorous pictures were also posted, seemingly to help people visualize Downing Street’s household items.

UK lockdown measures – including social distancing rules – have been in place since March 23, with rolling three-week reviews. Johnon’s administration is coming under increased pressure on the issue of primary schools reopening on June 1 – with teaching unions and local councils voicing their opposition to such a move.

In an interview with BBC Radio 4 on Friday, Nurse claimed that he believed that the UK government has not responded effectively to the outbreak of Covid-19.

Nurse - who won a Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 2001 – even asked who's really in charge of handling the pandemic, before adding he's uncertain that the British leaders themselves know the answer to that question.

“Who is developing the strategy and the operation and implementation of that strategy?” he asked. “I don't know, but more importantly, do they know?”

The scientist was particularly critical of Boris Johnson's administration for abandoning mass testing at an early stage of the outbreak, which meant that hospitals became “potentially unsafe spaces” as many asymptomatic staff and patients would have been infectious without knowing it. He did, however, praise frontline workers, comparing their bravery to that of “lions”.

Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis responded to Nurse's criticism in the same radio show, arguing that the government has been “very transparent” with people and insisting that they've been following “the best scientific advice out there” about tackling coronavirus.

PM Johnson has been heavily criticized by scientists and the opposition since the start of the pandemic for drastic PPE shortages across the NHS, as well as a lack of mass testing during the early stages, although the government maintains that it acted assuming a probable worst case scenario.

A report published by the 'Independent Sage' committee, chaired by Sir David King, says that “well-functioning local test, trace, and isolate protocols” – key conditions for the UK government to relax lockdown restrictions – will not be in place by the start of June.

Until [the protocols] are, it is not safe to open schools on June 1.

New modelling shows that the risk to pupils would be halved if UK ministers delayed their proposed school opening date by two weeks, allowing more time for an effective “test, trace and isolate” program to be established, according to the science committee.

The UK government is due to publish scientific evidence on Friday from its own official SAGE (Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies) committee, which is underpinning its plan to allow primary schools to reopen in a safe manner.

PM Boris Johnson told MPs in the House of Commons on Wednesday that 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new coronavirus cases a day, would be in place by June 1. However, the much-heralded NHS contact-tracing phone app will not be ready to be rolled out on the same date as planned.

In recent weeks, teaching unions have advised schools not to engage with the UK government about reopening until official guidance is updated to satisfy safety concerns.

Furthermore, a revolt of 68 – mainly Labour-led councils in England – has pushed Downing Street to admit it will not penalize some 1,500 primary schools who are adamant that they will disobey government calls to reopen on June 1, due to the Covid-19 outbreak.

The report suggests that if the delay lasted until September it would be even less risky, reducing the coronavirus threat to children below the possibility of death through a road traffic accident.

It comes as Public Health England's (PHE) Medical Director Yvonne Doyle told MPs on Friday morning that “ultimately, it will be for schools to decide” whether they are ready to reopen.

The latest data published by the Department for Health and Social Care on Thursday showed that the UK’s Covid-19 death toll has surpassed 36,000.

China’s National Health Commission said it confirmed zero new cases of the virus on Saturday – a first since the country began tallying infections in January – and reported only two suspected cases, one of them imported from abroad.

The lethal illness first emerged late last year in the Chinese city of Wuhan, spreading across the country to infect some 84,000 people, killing in excess of 4,600. But with aggressive containment measures that put tens of millions of citizens under strict lockdown, Beijing appears to have largely brought the contagion under control, reporting a only slow trickle of new cases as the virus took hold elsewhere in the world.

While the United States remains the top epicenter with more than 1.6 million infections, South America has quickly overtaken other regions for the number-two spot, with the World Health Organization (WHO) warning of a dramatic spike in cases there.

“In a sense, South America has become a new epicenter for the disease,” Dr Mike Ryan, the WHO's top emergencies expert, told a press conference on Friday, noting that Brazil is “clearly the most affected.”

Over the last week in Brazil, health officials have reported tens of thousands of new infections each day, bringing its current disease toll to more than 330,000, rapidly eclipsing Russia as the second-worst-affected nation. Brazil has also counted more than 21,000 fatal cases, nearly seven times more than Peru, the region’s next hardest-hit country.

Though no vaccine, or even a reliable treatment, currently exists for the coronavirus, Brazilian authorities have approved widespread use of the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine as a therapy, after receiving shipments of raw materials for the chemical from India last month. The drug has shown early promise as a treatment, but its effectiveness has yet to be proven in a clinical setting. A new study in the Lancet journal, meanwhile, suggests the medicine could cause heart complications and even death, showing little or no benefit to Covid-19 patients.

Since the pandemic broke out last December, more than 5.2 million people have been sickened and some 338,000 killed worldwide, making it one of the deadliest viral outbreaks since the 1918 Spanish Flu.

Stories Post-virus future: 4 trends that will shape the global economy

As the coronavirus pandemic has swept across the world, the media have been rife with predictions of an imminent economic crisis of historic proportions. The scenarios range from apocalyptic to slightly less so, which is understandable, since a cure for COVID-19 has yet to be found, and a vaccine isn't expected any time soon. The more optimistic prognosis envisages this as a chance to remake society and build a better future.

""The Great Lockdown""

The IMF predicts that the world will 'very likely' experience the worst recession since the 1930s, and expects the global economy to contract by 3% in 2020, which is a sharp downturn after years of continuous growth. Strict social distancing orders and lockdowns implemented by authorities around the world brought much global economic activity to a halt. The FTSE, Dow Jones and the Nikkei indices have all seen massive falls since the outbreak began. Global trade could, by various estimates, plummet by 13% to 32%, depending on the depth and extent of the crisis.

According to Goldman Sachs, the United States GDP is projected to nosedive by 24% in the second quarter of the year. And when GDP plummets, people lose jobs.

In April the US unemployment rate soared to 14.7%, which is worse than at any time since the Great Depression (and just two months ago it was at 3.5%).

In China, some 80 million people may already be out of work, with more to join them. The pandemic is disrupting global supply chains and international trade and is putting a significant strain on national healthcare systems. Travel restrictions implemented by nearly 100 countries have left tourism, leisure and hospitality sectors, and transportation services in a shambles.

The IMF has dubbed the current crisis ""the Great Lockdown"".

With the global health emergency adding an unprecedented level of uncertainty into the equation, the leading economists and global thinkers map out a new life after the virus. Here are the four principle trends likely to shape the global economy in the post-COVID era.

New isolationism (aka ""islandisation"")

The virus spreads with movement. Since the start of the pandemic, governments have tightened travel regulations between and within countries, which are likely to stay in place with varying degrees of severity at least through the end of the year.

While most epidemiologists agree the current virus outbreak will last between 18 and 24 months, coming back in waves of different intensity, borders can't possibly stay locked for that long.

Many countries are currently preparing to reopen – whether based on improved health data or due to the inability to sustain losses caused by the lockdown/Lei Jiang via Unsplash

To facilitate limited cross-border movement, group-based isolation models are already coming into play. Australia and New Zealand have committed to introducing a trans-Tasmanian ""COVID-safe travel zone"", the Baltic states are creating a ""travel bubble"" for their citizens. In contrast, the European Commission has released guidelines for lifting travel restrictions ""between areas or member states with sufficiently similar epidemiological situations"". Greece, on the other hand, is planning to mandate so-called ""health passports"" for tourists entering the country – such travellers will be waived an otherwise mandatory quarantine. Similar steps will be, likely, taken by other countries in an attempt to renew international travel, yet prevent new virus outbreaks.

These isolation models may result in stratification of society into two groups: those who'd developed immunity and those who haven't.

Speculation about the introduction of the so-called ""immunity passports"" for US citizens have been circulating for quite some time now. Still, civil right activists, including the American Civil Liberties Union – the country's largest civil rights group, – are sceptical about the idea. The thinking behind it is to identify those that could safely return to work and resume travel. This would disproportionately hurt the non-immune population and jeopardise civil rights and liberties – perhaps even tempting some to get sick just to develop anti-bodies and continue with their lives.

Isolationist tendencies in manufacturing are kicking in as well. Up until now, significant companies organised production using global value chains – that is, relocating production to low wage countries to cut costs. After the economic crisis of 2008/09, global value chain expansion may have come to a halt. However, recent developments revealed many countries, including the US, have been heavily relying on Chinese imports. It became painfully apparent with regards to medical protective equipment.

The Peterson Institute for International Economics suggests in 2018 ""China provided 43 per cent of world imports of face shields, protective garments, mouth-nose-protection equipment, gloves, and goggles"".

The same holds true for electronic components, automotive parts, pharmaceuticals, metals and other supply components imported from China and, to a lesser extent, Taiwan, Mexico and Vietnam.

In the wake of the coronavirus supply chains have been thrown into disarray: logistics became virtually impossible to control, and the prices on specific articles sky-rocketed as components and raw materials became scarce. With the IMF's World Uncertainty Index (WUI) ""three times the size of the uncertainty during the 2002–03 <…> (SARS) epidemic and about 20 times the size during the Ebola outbreak"" many corporations started to consider regionalisation of manufacturing. The US-China trade war has been another factor influencing this decision.

Disruptions introduced by the virus will likely remain a problem even after countries ease lockdowns and restart economic activity, so producing vital goods within national borders will become a priority. This may signal a retreat by global companies in favour of local players. As for export-oriented Asian economies, they may want to turn ""inwards"" catering more to local markets.

Reducing nonessential economic activities and offering added value

The current crisis isn't your ordinary economic crisis. The prescription for solving a regular financial crisis is relatively simple: the government spends and doles out stimulus funding until people start consuming and working again. In the case of the coronavirus crisis, it's health safety first. Therefore, we can't aim at fast economic recovery, as the whole point of quarantine and social distancing is to stop people from going to work and spreading the disease.

The economist James Meadway writes that the correct response to the COVID-19 crisis would not be a massive upscaling of production, but rather a massive scaling back of production.

Being able to reduce output without threatening livelihoods is vital for economies trying to be more resilient to pandemic crises.

This holds true for both the manufacturing and service sectors. Of course, different industries are being affected differently: aviation, tourism, and hospitality are hit the hardest unable to diversify and cope with the lost demand.

Major manufacturing companies, on the other hand – American household goods giant Kimberly-Clark and Coca-Cola with dozens of brand names under the belt, – are limiting the number of products they make, focusing on the ones in highest demand. Scalability, as well as the potential for diversification, will be a bonus: the UK Royal Mint, for instance, started producing medical visors for hospital use, while Dyson and many other manufacturers are producing ventilators or PPE. Being able to provide added value is also important: in the US national fast-food chains like McDonald's and Subway started to offer free delivery, others introduced everyday grocery items along with their menu staples.

Fast technological advances

Robotic automation and artificial intelligence (AI) will be crucial for the success of supply chains as they help reduce the need for humans to work face to face. With changing modes of consumption and interaction, more and more businesses will go ""digital first"".

After the coronavirus has been tamed, many former office workers will continue to work from home, as this model has proved successful and less costly.

Technological and mental barriers that made a presence on-site essential have been overcome – this is, in fact, one of the significant effects the pandemic has had on the work scene.

""I imagine the pandemic will speed up the development of the infrastructure needed to support our online work,"" says Susan Schneider, director of the ""AI, Mind and Society Group"" at The University of Connecticut, adding she's worried that ""…in a post-pandemic world, corporations may make less use of human labour, replacing human workers with automation and AI. Computers and robots don't get sick.""

Whether humans will remain the dominant workforce or not, remote work and learning that require connectivity and access to online resources, the increase in the number of online payments and day-to-day operations will make us even more dependent on tech companies.

Unmanned aerial vehicles, 'telehealth' and new space technologies are gaining momentum, moving from the realm of science fiction into the mainstream.

While some sectors of the economy will never be the same again, new ones will gain popularity and attract investments, among them security services, independent communication systems, and self-sustaining housing solutions.

Stronger government involvement in social and economic life

During the COVID-19 crisis, the role of government has undergone a dramatic change. Nations are looking to their respective governments to mobilise medical resources, implement containment measures and offer financial help. Free market solutions aiming at making a profit rather than catering to the public good aren't much help when millions of people lose their livelihood overnight. The American government is offering small business loans and direct payments to a vast number of people. Apart from that, the Senate promised to pay $50 billion in bailouts to airlines and $130 billion in aid to hospitals. Germany will spend some €40 billion to bolster small businesses, and in Denmark, the government is ready to cover 75-90 percent of salaries if companies do not lay off their employees. But unprecedented help comes with unprecedented control.

Both democratic and authoritarian regimes imposed quarantines, closed borders and implemented a variety of stringent measures. In the streets of China, drones search for people without face masks and chastise them over loudspeakers. In Israel, the national security agency is now allowed to access infected individuals' phone records. The UK's recently passed coronavirus bill gives police and immigration officers the right to arrest suspected virus carriers and have them tested. Germany, Austria, Italy, and Belgium use data from major telecommunication companies to track people's movement. The list goes on and on.

Shoshana Zuboff, the author of ""The Age of Surveillance Capitalism"" believes a pandemic is a perfect chance for governments to start monitoring their citizens more closely.

Measures that were once viewed as emergency ones may become a permanent rollback of civil rights.

Liberally-minded folks who fear this scenario are particularly concerned that, given the currently prescribed social distancing, activism has been reduced to ""clicktivism"". That means sitting at home on social media feeds and venting online, instead of rallying and being engaged in other forms of political protest.

When it comes to the economy, a certain degree of government intervention may not be such a terrible idea, as argued by free-market zealots. The Spanish flu of 1918 was, after all, a catalyst in the development of public health systems across quite a few countries, as many governments embraced the concept of socialised medicine.

For the last 25-30 years the most developed countries have been cutting down on public health programmes, and the current pandemic will perhaps encourage some to rethink their approach.

Speaking about scenarios global economies might be pressured to follow after the pandemic, analyst Simon Meir uses terms ""State capitalism"" and ""State socialism"". The first model being predominantly concerned with pursuing exchange value, and the second – with protecting life itself rather than protecting markets. The extreme version of the latter would involve nationalisation of healthcare, food and energy production and, perhaps, providing free housing. State capitalism, on the other hand, doesn't allow for extensive state intervention into the economy, apart from short-term loans for saving businesses. The author, however, points out that these models are likely ""to bleed into one another"". And this is what we're currently witnessing, with the pro-market Trump administration openly talking about taking stakes in airlines, oil and defence companies in exchange for grants.

Stories When living in a crisis is a job: lockdown survival tips from seasoned pros. Part 3: Polar Explorer

As the 'coronacrisis' poses one challenge after another, people are struggling to adapt to a new reality. RTD explores how people who endured hardship in their line of work handle isolation, uncertainty, and health risks – conditions many of us are experiencing during the coronavirus pandemic. In a series of short interviews, a cosmonaut, a submariner, and a polar explorer explain how to stay focused and even benefit from the current misfortunes.

The third hero is Viktor Boyarsky, an Honoured Polar Explorer of Russia, member of the Russian Geographical Society and the National Geographic Society of the United States, Chairman of the Polar Commission. He explains how a polar expedition can bring out the worst in people, what is the best way to fight loneliness, and what happens if you run out of food in the middle of an icy waste.

Polar explorers spend a lot of time away from their families. Today, a lot of people separated from their families by the lockdown, have to go through the same ordeal. From your experience, what is the best way to cope with this?

For a polar explorer, living away from your family for a year or more is one of the most challenging things. But then again, we know about this in advance, it doesn't take us by surprise. Do you remember the book, The Count of Monte Cristo? This man has just got married, and suddenly, he's thrown to jail for 18 years – that was so unexpected, so horrible, so hard to come to terms with. But with modern means of communication, even Antarctica has internet access, not to mention other ways to stay in touch.

How does it feel to be cut off from civilisation all the time? What is the most annoying or frustrating thing about it? How did you deal with this feeling?

Actually, everyone would like to find themselves away from the civilisation once. As the famous Russian bard Vladimir Vysotsky put it, 'North is freedom, hope, land without borders.' You get out of the tent, you look around, and you see snow, purity, ice. You can just let everything go; there's nothing around you that might upset you. I've been married for 46 years, and a total of 16 years I spent away from my family.

Polar explorers have to stay in a confined space with colleagues for months on end. Under lockdown, many people are limited to their small apartments, with their families. How did you manage that?

Polar explorers have nothing to worry about; they're like pilots, cosmonauts, submariners, they all put themselves in the lockdown voluntarily. With professions like these, you just take it for granted. What matters is that you have a job that needs to be done.

I went on some extreme expeditions. Usually, polar explorers live at research stations. You can get some privacy there; spend some time on your own. And when you're on an expedition, you have to stay in a tent for a long time. But even then, here's what we did: there were six of us (two men per tent), and we switched every six weeks, so it didn't get too boring.

What things could lead to conflict? How did you resolve disputes?

It all depends on a person's life experience, to what extent they are ready to cooperate with others in an extraordinary situation, to avoid any escalation. Sometimes, you have to look for common ground, agreeing to things that you would deem unthinkable in any other situation. Being able to compromise under duress is a sign of strength, not weakness. When someone insists on doing things their way, it could result in a conflict. So, you should take one step back, give way, even if it's against your principles – in this situation, it'd be justified.

Did you pick people that you knew would be able to cooperate well?

You don't pick your team beforehand; it happens on its own. Usually, when the station is established, people are hired according to their professional skills. And then, during the winter camp, people gradually get used to each other. Later, it becomes apparent, who will work together next time, and who will never work with each other. A stationmaster writes character references, they determine the future of these people. Who's not recommended for working at the winter camp, who's too difficult, uncooperative or unsociable. That's how people are filtered out.

What is the absolute no-go when you're in a confined space with peers/relatives? Joking, gossiping?

It's not just about staying in a confined space; it's about being able to live with a small select group of people. That's when the true character is revealed, the traits that remained hidden before. In such situations, you should try to avoid hurting other people's feelings. You should put aside your ambitions for the time being, and observe everything that is going on around you carefully.

The loneliness. What would you recommend those people who spend the lockdown on their own? How can they avoid sinking into despair?

When you get the blues, you should try to look at the situation from 'it could've been worse' perspective. You should always compare what you could've had and what you've got – it helps to see things from a universal human standpoint. Then you'll stop worrying about 'oh, someone took my bowl or my glass,' such things start to seem a mere trifle, it's sobering.

The fear. People have a lot of worries too – to get sick, to leave their dependents to their own devices, the fear of the unknown. What fears did you face in expeditions, how did you overcome them? Can your methods help our readers?

Through the ice drifts and towards the North Pole, 2003/Viktor Boyarsky's personal archive

During our major expedition, when we walked to Antarctica, the prevailing fear was to contract some serious illness. In our situation, we couldn't expect help from anywhere. We would've just remained there. Despite this, there is no flu or colds in the Arctic and Antarctica; there are no viruses. All the infection is brought from the mainland when the teams are swapped. After that, the entire station comes down with something. But generally, all the polar explorers undergo medical examination before being dispatched to an expedition. Some severe conditions might show up there. The heart might fail, for example. We had such examples.

As for resources, in an expedition, they are calculated according to how much supplies one person needs per day. Sometimes, you run out of food. But today, you can always request help from the station. They either bring you supplies or take you from there.

If someone hurts himself, the rest share his work among them. But if a person feels really sick, you can call for a rescue plane. Later, when this person gets better, they make up for lost time – do a day's worth of work in half a day, and so on.",32.5,Very low,Right-center,Russia
