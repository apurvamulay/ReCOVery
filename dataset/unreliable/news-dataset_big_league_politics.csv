It was reported that police have been warning of the danger to children from predators online especially now during the coronavirus lockdown which keeps people indoors. Between late March and late April, Scotland Yard claimed that almost 100 children were targeted in London alone.

Some have pointed out that curiously, no information other than age appears to have been given out concerning the arrested men. Given the UK’s abysmal history with foreign rape gangs, overwhelmingly composed of Muslim men from Middle Eastern and Asian countries, this may mean this is just another instance in a depressingly steady pattern.

Bradford, described as “multicultural” by Breitbart, was the location of yet another case of child grooming gangs, according to a report from 2018. Of the suspects, 63% were of Pakistani background, and many others from other Asian and African countries, with only a minority being “white British.”

Police also reportedly seized over 60 devices which were used both to exploit children online and store indecent pictures.

According to a detective chief inspector, “Targeted operations like these demonstrate that we take the online sexual exploitation of children in Bradford District seriously and that we will take action against offenders and safeguard those children they have attempted to exploit.”

Unfortunately, the UK’s record on the competency and will of its police in dealing with foreign rape gangs does not inspire confidence. Indeed, tragically, there have been multiple cases of cops themselves participating in the abuse of minors.

Despite the nature of the offences and the stated urgency of the issue, as well as the statements of police praising their own actions, for reasons not clear all of the men were released under investigation or bailed shortly after having been taken into custody, and are presumably roaming free once again as inquiries continue.

This, along with the lack of transparency surrounding the case, certainly does not inspire confidence that British children are being protected as they should be. Unfortunately, even the current Conservative government has proven itself feckless and unwilling to truly tackle or even honestly address this issue which is of such dire and tragic consequence to the most vulnerable of its own citizens.",12.5,Low,Extreme right,USA,0

Nessel claims that if any worker gets sick at the Ford plant, she could make the determination that it happened because of Trump’s visit and shut the plant down. Even though there is no way this could be proven, these are actions Nessel is willing to consider.

“In Michigan, that is the law,” Nessel said while making an appearance on CNN.

“I think we are going to have to have a very serious conversation with Ford in the event that they permitted the president to be in publicly enclosed places in violation of the order,” Nessel said. “They knew exactly what the order was.”

President Trump hit Nessel back in a Twitter post for her insane threats:

The Wacky Do Nothing Attorney General of Michigan, Dana Nessel, is viciously threatening Ford Motor Company for the fact that I inspected a Ventilator plant without a mask. Not their fault, & I did put on a mask. No wonder many auto companies left Michigan, until I came along! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 22, 2020

President Trump has generally avoided wearing a mask to set an example for Americans not to submit to fear while the fake news media pumps non-stop coronavirus hysteria to Americans who are essentially being held hostage by the shutdown.

Big League Politics reported on how the president thumbed his nose at Nessel and all of the thugs within Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration before his visit to the Ford plant:

Ford will not threaten Trump with an ultimatum to wear the mask. Trump has avoided wearing a mask during public appearances, showing that he will not succumb to the mass hysteria. The president is setting an example for ordinary Americans to overcome the media-induced panic. “As we have said previously, we shared our safety policies and recommendations with the White House in advance of this visit. The White House has its own safety and testing policies in place and will make its own determination,” Ford said in a statement. Trump has refused the advice of the deep state bureaucracy, which wants to scare people into wearing masks. The mask has emerged as a sign of cowardice and obsequiousness throughout the pandemic. “The CDC is advising the use of non-medical cloth face covering as an additional voluntary public health measure. So it’s voluntary. You don’t have to do it. But they suggest it for a period of time. I don’t think I’m going to be doing it,” Trump said.

Because Nessel cannot do anything against Trump other than whine, she may attempt to punish the Ford plant and put more people on the unemployment line due to her tantrum.",12.5,Low,Extreme right,USA,0

In addition to having a history of mental illness, the assailant has an assault case that is pending in Washtenaw County. This highly dangerous individual was put around vulnerable people who he could brutalize as well as possibly infect with COVID-19.

The assailant’s father said that his son had been taken to a group home for supervision, but had a mental health relapse as he was hearing voices in his head. When he was taken to the University of Michigan Hospital for supervision as a result, he was diagnosed with COVID-19. That is when he was taken to the Westwood Nursing Center where he would commit his savage assault.

It is unknown whether or not the nursing home called the police to alert them about the assault that had taken place in their facilities. The assailant is currently in police custody, and it is yet to be determined if he will be charged for what he did.

The sickening video of the assault can be seen here:

“He never should have been housed.. quarantined with the victim that he eventually assaulted. That should have never happened,” the father said. “Someone dropped the ball.”

The person who dropped the ball may have been Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who issued a directive that forced COVID-19 patients to be housed in nursing homes.

Big League Politics reported on how state Democrats are turning on Whitmer for essentially issuing death sentences to the elderly with her incomprehensible and arguably genocidal policy prescriptions:

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer’s heavy-handed authoritarian governance has made her a pariah throughout the state, and Democrats are starting to become frustrated with her leadership as a result. State representative Leslie Love (D-Detroit) is flabbergasted over Whitmer’s order to send coronavirus patients into nursing homes, which has resulted in an untold number of unnecessary deaths by putting the most vulnerable population at needless risk. “To return seniors into an environment, seniors with the virus still recovering from the virus, into an environment with, well, seniors, just didn’t seem — it’s not a good idea,” Love said. Whitmer made an executive order in April that mandated seniors diagnosed with COVID-19 to be placed into nursing homes, called “regional hubs,” to be around other healthy seniors. State officials claim that the policy is effective because of distance requirements that are required between the healthy and unhealthy seniors. “It’s a good move, a good step to make these regional hubs, and I think as we move forward, we have to look at making sure we’re really implementing best practices, looking to other best practices across the state,” Chief Medical Executive Joneigh S. Khaldun said. Initially, the state wanted to put the sick seniors at the TCF Center in Detroit but that became untenable after the site was shut down. This meant seniors with coronavirus were put into nursing homes among the vulnerable instead. Love is worried about individuals in nursing homes throughout the state, including her 86-year-old mother, catching the highly-infectious disease. “That would break my heart because I’ve been on the front lines of this, trying to make sure our seniors — my mother, your mother, anybody else’s mother — does not get sick and die from this, particularly if they’re in a nursing home,” Love said.

Complicit government officials like Whitmer want to keep the panic going so they cannot be held accountable for their crimes against humanity in how they have responded to the pandemic.",12.5,Low,Extreme right,USA,0

The abuse of the H1B visa system to replace American workers with cheaper and more compliant foreign visa workers is both extensive and well documented within the technology industry. The visa structure keeps its recipients dependent on their employer for legal status within the country, creating a form of de facto indentured servitude in which employers have near-complete control over the workers they sponsor for the visas.

The visa system also enables major employers to depress wages within the American workforce, allowing companies to import workers from countries with vastly lower labor and living standards. President Donald Trump’s administration is considering suspending the program on an indefinite basis in the midst of the coronavirus recession to place American workers first again, lining up the nation’s professionals to reap the gains of economic recovery. Leading immigration patriot senators are pushing for the President to place the program on ice.

The notion of doubling down on the hiring of new American workers- even as millions of Americans are driven into unemployment through the coronavirus recession- appears simply inconsiderable for the country’s wealthiest and most affluent technology companies.

Pew tweeted, “Hispanics are the most supportive of the federal government providing medical and economic support to undocumented immigrants affected by the coronavirus outbreak.”

Approximately two-thirds of U.S. adults (68 percent) believe the federal government has an obligation to provide medical care to illegal aliens who caught the Wuhan virus. Additionally, 37 percent stated that the government should supply economic aid to illegal aliens who have lost their job due to the outbreak, according to a Pew Research Center survey that was conducted from April 29 to May 5.

Hispanics were the group most in favor of the federal government allocating medical and economic resources to illegal immigrants affected by the Wuhan virus outbreak. The vast majority of Hispanics (86 percent) say the government has an obligation to provide medical care, and 62 percent had similar thoughts about economic help. Hispanic immigrants are more likely than American-born Hispanics (68 percent vs. 55 percent) to support federal economic help for illegal aliens affected by the outbreak. However, the views between the two groups were more similar regarding medical care (88 percent vs. 83 percent).

Trump has made axing the administrative state, meaning the massive federal bureaucracy that strangles economic growth, a constant priority throughout his tenure in the White House.

Big League Politics has reported on how Trump’s deregulation push has driven liberals up the wall:

President Donald Trump has rolled out his new coal deregulation plan, and it is causing frantic liberals to claim it is the end of the world. Vanity Fair released a hyperbolic article about Trump’s common sense plan to let the states decide their own carbon emissions policies. The article claims that this federalist plan to abide by the Constitution would cause thousands of deaths as well as an increase in diseases. “We’re on the right side of history,” Environmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler said to the New York Times, infuriating liberals even further. What has liberals really spooked is the inevitable court challenges to Trump’s Affordable Clean Energy rule. They are worried that the Supreme Court, bolstered by two conservative justices appointed by Trump, could set a precedent making it very difficult for future presidents to ever address their much-ballyhooed climate crisis. While liberals complain about these new policies from their ivory towers, the Senators from West Virginia are happy about the changes made by President Trump that will help the blue collar workers in their state. “Our emissions are on a downward slope and have been without a Clean Power Plan, and we’re going to keep moving towards that way regardless of what regulation we have in order because we know it’s better for the environment and the health of people,” Sen. Shelley Moore Capito (R-WV) said. Even her Democratic counterpart has to admit that Trump’s policy is a step forward from the policies of his predecessor. “I never supported the CPP because it required coal plants to install emission controls that were not “commercially proven” at the time. It is unreasonable to ask power plants to utilize technologies that do not yet exist, and penalize them if they don’t. For this reason and others, the regulation became a subject of intense litigation causing further uncertainty for our power sector. While we are still reviewing the final rule and its implications, the rule does offer fossil plants greater compliance flexibility, which I support,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV) said.

While liberals use the coronavirus pandemic as an excuse to shred the Constitution and let dangerous criminals out of jail, Trump makes power moves that actually help the American people.",12.5,Low,Extreme right,USA,0

Contrast that with coverage of Cuomo, who issued a direct order forcing nursing homes to take in COVID patients, resulting in thousands of lives lost.

CNN had Cuomo and his brother engaging in prop comedy, never once mentioning the nursing home scandal.

Fox News personality Greg Gutfeld lauded DeSantis’ response, calling it “full Trump.”

“Maybe Trump is contagious, because man, that guy went full Trump and he deserved every moment to say what he had to say because the media held him accountable for things he didn’t do, and meanwhile didn’t hold other people accountable for things they did,” Gutfeld said.

“They didn’t hold China accountable and they didn’t hold those responsible for the rest home scandals accountable,” he continued. “They turned Andrew Cuomo into a saint while totally vilifying this guy.”

The mainstream media in this country is as corrupt an institute as there is. Good on DeSantis for calling them out.
