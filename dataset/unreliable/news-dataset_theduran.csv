“Six big lies you have been told about Russiagate” authored by Nebojsa Malic, via RT…

‘Russian meddling’ in the 2016 US presidential election has become an article of faith, not just among Democrats but many Republicans as well, thanks to the endless repetition of vague talking points, none of which hold water.

It all began with the Democratic National Committee (DNC) claiming in June 2016 that Russia hacked their computers, after documents were published revealing the party’s rigging of the primaries. This was followed by Hillary Clinton accusing her rival for the presidency, Donald Trump, of “colluding” with Russia by asking Moscow for her emails – the ones she deleted from a private server she used to conduct State Department business, that is.

With a little help from the mainstream media, which overwhelmingly endorsed Clinton and predicted her victory, her efforts to cover up her email scandal turned into Russia “hacking our democracy,” eventually spawning the ‘Russiagate’ investigation led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and a series of failed attempts to derail Trump’s election and oust him from the White House.

Lie #1: Russia hacked the DNC

The infamous US intelligence community assessment (ICA) of January 2017, and the Senate Intelligence Committee report based on it – as well as ‘analysis’ by actual election meddlers, among others – all claimed that the Russian government and President Vladimir Putin personally were behind the “hack” and publication of DNC documents. These have always been assertions, and no evidence was ever provided.

Last week’s declassification of 50+ interviews in the probe conducted by the House Intelligence Committee revealed that the cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike, brought in by the DNC lawyers to fix the “hack,” did not have evidence either.

CrowdStrike’s president, ex-FBI official Shawn Henry, testified that they “saw activity that we believed was consistent with activity we’d seen previously and had associated with the Russian Government.” [emphasis added]

In the same testimony, Henry also testified that CrowdStrike never had any evidence the data was actually “exfiltrated,” i.e. stolen from the DNC servers.

CrowdStrike’s feelings about the hack remain the only “evidence” so far, since the FBI never asked them or the DNC for the actual server, as Henry also confirmed. Meanwhile, former NSA official and whistleblower William Binney argued back in November 2017 that actual evidence showed a leak from the inside, not a hack.

Lie #2: Russia hacked Podesta’s emails and published them in collusion with WikiLeaks

There is likewise zero proof that the Russian government had anything to do with the private email account of John Podesta, Clinton’s campaign chair, which a staffer admitted had been compromised when someone fell for a phishing scam.

Instead, the key argument that WikiLeaks was somehow ‘colluding’ with Russia over the publication of the emails rests on a conspiracy theory promoted by the Clinton campaign staff, after RT reported on a fresh batch of emails before WikiLeaks got around to tweeting about them – but after they were published on the website and available to anyone willing to do actual journalism.

In fact, the existence of RT has been a major “argument” of Russiagaters; a third of the ICA intended to show ‘Russian meddling’ consisted of a four-year-old appendix about RT that was in no way relevant to the 2016 situation but lamented its coverage of fracking and ‘Occupy Wall Street’ protests, for example.

Lie #3: The Steele ‘pee tape’ dossier was irrelevant

As it later emerged, Clinton’s claims about ‘Russian collusion’ were based on a dodgy dossier her campaign commissioned through the DNC and a firm called Fusion GPS from a British spy named Christopher Steele. It said that the Kremlin was blackmailing Trump with a tape of depraved sex acts in a Moscow hotel, with prostitutes supposedly paid to urinate on a bed President Barack Obama had slept on.

It was clearly ridiculous and entirely evidence-free. Democrats claimed it played no role in Russia investigations. Yet the FBI paid Steele for information from the dossier, and used it to justify a FISA warrant for the surveillance of Trump campaign aide Carter Page – and with him the campaign itself – starting right before the election, and renewed three times.

By January 2020, the DOJ had formally disavowed the dossier and all four FISA warrants, along with any information obtained from them, saying “there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause.”

Lie #4: General Michael Flynn treasonously colluded with Russia and lied about it to the FBI

Trump’s first national security adviser was hounded out of the White House after less than two weeks on the job, after media leaks insinuated he had improperly discussed sanctions with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, violating the Logan Act, and then lied to the FBI about it.

After FBI Director James Comey was fired by Trump in May 2017, he told the media the president had urged him to drop the investigation of Flynn, which was quickly construed as “obstruction” and used as one of the pretexts to appoint Robert Mueller as special counsel into Russiagate.

When actual evidence was finally coaxed out of prosecutors, however, it showed that the FBI sought to frame Flynn in a perjury trap, and that the people involved were Comey himself, his deputy Andrew McCabe, disgraced lovers Peter Strzok and Lisa Page, and others. All charges against Flynn were dropped.

Flynn didn’t even lie to Strzok and the other agent interviewing him – and the memo of that conversation had been first heavily edited, then destroyed. Basically, everything about the Flynn case has been as false as ABC’s December 2017 bombshell report about his “collusion” with Russia that got Brian Ross fired.

Lie #5: Mueller found collusion, or at least Russian meddling

When Mueller’s final report came out, in the spring of 2019, it found zero evidence of “collusion” but insisted there had been Russian “meddling” in the election. The only trouble was that he had no proof of meddling, basing it entirely on the above-mentioned intelligence “assessments” and his own indictments.

A Russian company named in one of the indictments actually contested it in a US court and won. First, a federal judge slapped down Mueller’s prosecutors for violating rules by presenting allegations as “established” and “confirmed” facts and ruling that no link was actually established behind a catering company accused of “sowing discord” on social media – a far cry from hacking the DNC! – and the Russian government.

The DOJ quietly dropped that particular case in March, just as coronavirus shutdowns were starting across the US, using “recent events” and a change in classification of some of its evidence as a face-saving excuse.

Lie #6: Paul Manafort was Trump’s conduit to Russia

Paul Manafort, who ran Trump’s campaign between March and August 2016, was convicted of multiple counts of conspiracy against the US and sentenced to a lengthy prison term. However, despite repeated attempts by the media to present him as some kind of liaison between Trump and Russia, the entirety of things that got him in trouble with the law had to do with tax evasion on money he made lobbying for and in… Ukraine.

During the two trials against Manafort, it emerged that he and his business partner Rick Gates had worked with Podesta’s brother Tony to fleece Ukrainian oligarchs for years, and stash the profits in tax havens.

The Ukrainian officials who leaked the so-called “black ledger” implicating Manafort to the US media were even convicted of election meddling by a court in Kiev, and the whole thing may have been solicited by a Ukrainian-American DNC contractor… The US media have been curiously uninterested in that particular “collusion,” needless to say.

Peel back all these layers of misinformation, like an onion, and what’s left is an empty talking point, endlessly repeated by Democrats like Adam Schiff (D-California), that “Russia hacked our democracy.”

The charge is vague enough that it can mean anything, and deliberately so. No evidence is ever offered, because there isn’t any – as the years of investigations and boxes full of documents have clearly shown.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson plans to reduce the role of Huawei in the U.K.’s 5G network in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, according to reports in the Guardian and the Telegraph.

Johnson has instructed officials to draft plans that would reduce Huawei’s involvement in building the U.K.’s 5G phone network to zero by 2023, the Telegraph reported.

The move marks a departure from the U.K. government’s previous position. In January, Johnson said he would allow the Chinese tech giant to build up to 35 percent of its 5G phone network but block access to “sensitive core” parts of the network.

The push for new plans comes amid growing backlash among Conservative MPs against Chinese investment and a lack of transparency around Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the Telegraph.

The paper also reported Johnson hopes to ramp up trade talks with the United States, which has been one of the most vocal critics of the U.K.’s decision to allow Huawei into its market, citing security concerns.

The reports “simply don’t make sense,” Huawei Vice President Victor Zhang said in a statement. “As a private company, 100% owned by employees, which has operated in the UK for 20 years, our priority has been to help mobile and broadband companies keep Britain connected, which in this current health crisis has been more vital than ever. This is our proven track-record.”

The union is in complete disarray economically, socially, and politically. As the block plunges into recession, anti-EU and anti-Euro sentiment is continuing to grow rapidly.

The ground zero for this sentiment is Italy. For almost a decade, Italy has been on the edge of facing a similar crisis to that of Greece. This has mainly been due to the large deficits produced by the right-wing Berlusconi governments. Since 2018, anti-establishment and anti-EU sentiment in Italy continues to grow, with anti-EU populists now making up a majority of the Italian parliament. Berlusconi’s party is now polling at 6%, while former centre-left Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s party continues to barely make the polling threshold needed to enter parliament. When the coronavirus crisis hit, right-wing populists such as Matteo Salvini and Georgia Meloni viciously went after the Euro, pushing for a return to an Italian currency to better handle the crisis. They also criticized the European Union as a whole for its late response to the coronavirus in Italy, which forced the government to turn to aid from Russia.

Their push seems to be working. According to a poll published by Tecne, 47% of Italians support leaving the Eurozone and 46% support leaving the European Union altogether. To compare, only 41% of those polled supported remaining in the union.

Italy, however, isn’t the only nation in Europe where Europskepticism is on the rise. A recent poll suggests nearly 60% of France has no trust in Brussels, up 10 points since the election of Emanuel Macron. This comes as Macron faces increased pressure to resign, this time coming from the left as 10 of his party’s MPs have switched parties. Macron, a former Rothschild banker, often dubbed as a “puppet of the big banks”, has slowly been losing control of his country. As the Yellow Vest protests are starting to revive, the president is also being faced by migrant riots. Time will tell how long Macron can hold on. Recent polling suggests that he could be ousted in the next election by the far-right Marine le Pen.

As the union struggles to hold on economically, the idea of issuing Eurobonds is being seen as an option to satisfy Italy. That option, however, may be off the table as a German court recently declared it unconstitutional. Merkel has since announced she opposes the plan.

George Soros has came out in support for the Eurobond program: “A 1 trillion-euro bond would cost 5 billion euros a year, assuming an interest rate of 0.5%. The consols would not need to be sold all at once; they could be issued in tranches and they would be snatched up by long-term investors like life insurance companies.” The move would add $1 trillion of debt to the European Union as a whole, as if Europe didn’t have enough debt.

Along with Soros, Macron has announced his support for the plan. Unlike Merkel, who at times will turn on the World Order in favor of the interests of her own nation, Macron almost always carries out the interests of those who put him in power. Despite support from Macron, the move seems more and more unlikely as Merkel has not backed down in her opposition to the plan.

Will economic troubles lead to a collapse in the union? George Soros seems to think so. “If the EU is unable to consider it now [Eurobonds], it may not be able to survive the challenges it currently confronts… This is not a theoretical possibility; it may be the tragic reality.”

With globalist leaders such as Macron and Italian Prime Minister Conte on the edge of losing power to the far-right, economic troubles for the block may trigger the collapse of both the European Union along with the establishment governments within the block. Time will tell. However, since one of the main architects of the union already echos this sentiment, we may already know the answer.

As lockdown restrictions begin to be lifted, and we slowly aim to return to ‘normality’, questions are beginning to be asked about just what that normality should be. For never in recent history has a crisis so blatantly highlighted the inequalities in our society. And it’s not just those on the left that think so. Veteran right-wing journalist Max Hastings, recently wrote a piece in which he said the coronavirus pandemic unleashed a demand for ‘social, political and economic reform unprecedented in our memories’. Even the former governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, recently admitted that when this is over, it would be ‘reasonable’ for people to ‘demand improvements’ in the quality of social provision and healthcare.

The reality is that Covid-19 has turned capitalists into socialists overnight, whether they like it or not. We’ve kept hearing about governments making the choice between people and the economy. But people are the economy. Fundamentally, we need a change in priorities. The danger is that we return to a status quo from which another crisis will be born: this pandemic is not over yet, the threat of another one in future is real, and we need to have the social measures in place to enable us to deal with the fallout. Britain only has to compare itself statistically with other nations to realize that, along with the US, it has suffered particularly badly so far from this disease, and we have to ask why. An under-funded healthcare system, together with a 20% poverty rate surely plays a role.

In the midst of this ‘war’, with unemployment set to skyrocket, and families struggling to pay the rent and feed their children, Jeremy Corbyn’s agenda at the last election looks appealing. The renationalisation of key industries, a ‘living’ wage, a massive social housing programme, and immediate pay rise for public sector workers; somehow it doesn’t seem so ‘radical’ after all. The latest figures show that people living in poorer areas in Britain are twice as likely to succumb to coronavirus. What is the government doing about it? Not much. One of the Tory pledges in their 2019 election manifesto was to add five years on to life expectancy by 2035. But that’s a tall order and would mean a significant change in policies – not just in the short term for dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic – but in the long term. We may be the world’s fifth largest economy but Britain is currently ranked 29th in the global life expectancy index, behind a host of European countries.

The question is, what kind of post-Covid-19 future do we want? Already comparisons are being made with the aftermath of the Depression and the Second World War. After the Depression, President Roosevelt stated that ‘heedless self-interest is…bad economics’ and that ‘freedom from want’ must be a key factor in policy-making. As for the UK, war-time leader Winston Churchill’s Conservative party was rejected in the 1945 election in favour of Labour, whose manifesto brandished the slogan ‘The Labour party is a Socialist party and proud of it’. The policies on which the party won were radical: nationalisation of the Bank of England, the coal and energy industries, public transport, and iron and steel. During the war, inequality was laid bare much in the same way as it has been during this current pandemic, and we saw the 1942 Beveridge report published, which laid the foundation for the welfare state – the cornerstone of British society as we know it today.

‘Goodbye globalisation’ read the front cover of this week’s Economist. It argues that globalisation was already on the rocks after the 2008 financial crash and Trump’s war with China; Covid-19 has been the final nail in the coffin. It predicts that global trade faces a troubling time ahead as governments, forced to underwrite national firms, will continue to favour them moving forward. But this can only be welcomed. Firstly, global trade generally means rich countries exploiting cheap workers abroad. Aside from welfare, a return to ‘normality’ would be disastrous for the planet. Satellite images have shown the remarkable changes which have taken place in our atmosphere across the globe as lockdowns were imposed on an international scale. Carbon dioxide emissions are set to have fallen this year by 8%, but this would have to occur every year for a decade in order to limit global warming to less than 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures.

Obviously, repeated and prolonged lockdown is not a solution, but some serious attempt must be made to address climate change before it’s too late. The coronavirus pandemic illustrates just how mother nature can floor us before we know it. She can’t be underestimated. Indeed there has been something wonderful about the way nature has been able to reclaim its territory in this short time, with social media packed with viral videos of wild animals roaming the empty streets of our metropolises without a care in the world. It could be imagination, but somehow even the trees and bushes seem more green and luscious at this time.

So while governments take their first steps back towards ‘normality’, it’s vital that, as a race, we don’t. This is a pivotal moment in our history, when the world is on pause, that we can think about what kind of future we want for our grandchildren, instead of being completely at the mercy of business, blindly bashing on, maximizing profit at whatever the cost. As William Beveridge proclaimed back in 1942 “A revolutionary moment in the world’s history is a time for revolutions, not for patching.’

Sure, this led to a pluralistic society, and sure, there are major challenges for each faith group in competition with other such groups and with the predominant secularism in the US, but believers have always had the freedom to pray and worship as they like.

Until now.

The coronavirus pandemic brought in a wide series of restrictions against gathering in public places all over the world. In our own series on the rightness or wrongness of Orthodox Christian places of worship closing due to government regulations, we noted that the restriction on religious worship is not particularly directed at Christians only. Mecca is closed, the Indian, Japanese and some Jewish religious activities have all shown the effects of COVID-19 prevention regimes.

However, in the United States, we now have elected leaders violating the principles set forth in the Constitution, namely, the very first Amendment:

“Congress shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free excercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.”

Instead, we have governors ordering churches closed, people fined and even arrested for going, and in places like Mississippi, the sentiment against Christian churchgoers has turned particularly nasty. A parish was burned to the ground, acccording to The New York Times:

The burning of a church in northern Mississippi this week is being investigated as arson because of a spray-painted message at the scene that seemed to criticize the church’s defiance of coronavirus restrictions. First Pentecostal Church had sued the city of Holly Springs, Miss., which is about an hour southeast of Memphis, arguing that its stay-at-home order had violated the church’s right to free speech and interfered with its members’ ability to worship. After firefighters put out the blaze early Wednesday, the police found a message, “Bet you stay home now you hypokrits,” spray-painted on the ground near the church’s doors, according to Maj. Kelly McMillen of the Marshall County Sheriff’s Department. A photograph of the graffiti also appears to show an atomic symbol with an “A” in the center, which is sometimes used as a logo for atheist groups.

One thing this clearly proves is that bigots cannot spell correctly.

But it also proves there is a great deal of animosity against Christians. This kind of attack would not have taken place even ten years ago, but now the anti-Christian climate in the United States is such that incidents like this are looking for ways to happen.

This video shows how embedded anti-Christian attitudes are now in the press corps at the White House. Watch as Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany deftly and forcefully handles the ferocious accusations that go beyond First Amendment sensibilities.

On Friday, May 22nd, President Trump called on state governments to allow churches to open, and has also threatened to override any state that refuses to do so. Here is what he said, with emphasis added:

Thank you very much. At my direction, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is issuing guidance for communities of faith. I want to thank Dr. Redfield and the CDC for their work on this matter and all the other work they’ve been doing over the past what now seems like a long period of time. Today I’m identifying houses of worship, churches, synagogue and mosques as essential places that provide essential services. Some governors have deemed liquor stores and abortion clinics as essential, but have left out churches and other houses of worship. It’s not right. So I’m correcting this injustice and calling houses of worship essential. I call upon governors to allow our churches and places of worship to open right now. If there’s any question, they’re going to have to call me, but they’re not going to be successful in that call. These are places that hold our society together and keep our people united. The people are demanding to go to church and synagogue, go to their mosque. Many millions of Americans embrace worship as an essential part of life. The ministers, pastors, rabbis, imams and other faith leaders will make sure that their congregations are safe as they gather and pray. I know them well. They love their congregations. They love their people. They don’t want anything bad to happen to them or to anybody else. The governors need to do the right thing and allow these very important, essential places of faith to open right now for this weekend. If they don’t do it, I will override the governors. In America, we need more prayer, not less. Thank you very much. Thank you.

President Trump has this basic point right: without prayer to God, our nation is sunk. And it is, indeed, amazing how vile and anti-Christian our supposed “best and brightest” have turned out to be. Incidentally, the press and “Experts” are saying that the president has no power to make this stick. They are wrong. In the spirit of the First Amendment, he absolutely does have the power to make this order stick.

Recently, the number of American ships and planes in the Caribbean Sea has increased exponentially. The most likely hypothesis so far is that there will be an attempt to block Venezuela, as the military flow in the region began to grow only after Iran announced the sending of oil ships to the Bolivarian country. On May 14, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said that the boats that take gasoline to Venezuelan ports are being persecuted by the American Navy, which is worsening with the arrival of Iranian ships. The White House has already reported that it has taken retaliation against this cooperation between Venezuelans and Iranians, but no further information has been provided on the military operations being carried out. The United States has announced sanctions against any company that participates in the supply of gasoline to Venezuela, which is causing a structural crisis of fuel scarcity in the South American country.

In addition to the blockade, there is a humanitarian issue, as American measures are inducing a major economic recession in the Bolivarian Republic. It has also been reported by the Venezuelan government that the tax imposed by the United States is affecting the country’s food supply, which is already having an effect on society. With a crisis and the siege being imposed on Caracas, how do Venezuelans use to deal with the advancing pandemic of new coronaviruses? How can the Bolivarian government manage a major economic and social crisis with imminent health danger? It is just the American strategy: to raise a siege and provoke the Venezuelan national collapse, inducing, through coercion, Nicolás Maduro’s government to accept changes in the regime for the benefit of Washington.

The naval blockade is just one of the measures the United States is taking to overthrow Nicolás Maduro’s legitimate government. A few days ago, an attempted invasion against the country, carried out by Colombian mercenaries on American speedboats, was neutralized, with several terrorists arrested. Apparently, the sea will be the path by which Washington will try to overthrow Maduro, insisting on the military operation as solution of international controversies. The case also indicates the presence of the so-called “extermination war”, an ancient warlike practice in which a country is surrounded and kept under block by the navy of another nation, preventing the arrival of goods and food in port areas, affecting the population as a whole, indirectly leading thousands of people to hunger, misery and death. Basically, this is exactly the American goal in Venezuela with the current blockade. Without formally declaring war, Washington adopts an even more insidious strategy than traditional military confrontation.

However, there is yet another important factor – and above Venezuela – behind the American interest in militarizing the Caribbean Sea. Since at least the First World War, the USA has occupied a position of undisputed supremacy on the seas, which allowed Washington, in time, to exercise a role of “global naval police”. However, this reality is changing day after day, since the world is already beginning to contemplate a response from nations to American naval power, especially in Asia.

In the Asian continent, China and Iran are challenging the American Navy. In China, the progress of the Navy is absolute, with the Chinese having already succeeded, for the first time in its history, to overcome the International Date Line and concluding military tests in spaces traditionally occupied by the American maritime forces. In Iran, the maneuvering of small vessels against large American ships is daring. Recently, some sources have informed that Tehran will produce nuclear submarines, with the aim of increasing its naval power.

The United States has spoken out several times condemning its opponents in China and Iran, but nothing has been done other than the mere war of words. In practice, it is difficult to deny that the United States has a naval power today that is much less powerful than it was decades ago. Washington did not attack its rivals in Asia simply because it could not handle a counteroffensive from Beijing or Tehran – at least not without a big material loss as a result.

All of these factors are contributing to a redirection of the American Navy’s strategic policies. No longer able to keep its global power intact, Washington manages its forces for the southern portions of the American continent itself, guaranteeing a regional space of power. However, in the Americas the opposition to US possible aggression will be fierce and will have international support from other continents.

Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas announced that the Palestinian state and the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) will no longer adhere to the agreements they signed with Israel and the United States. It is a reaction to Israel’s intentions to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank. If Abbas’s intentions are consistently implemented, it would be a paradox for Palestine to abolish itself.

“The Palestinian Liberation Organization and the Palestinian state are rejecting any commitments from all agreements with the US administration and Israel, including those related to security,” Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said in response to the Israeli government’s intention to start on July 1 the process of annexing territories controlled by illegal Jewish settlers in the West Bank.

Abbas did not mention any specific agreements, but it is believed he is referring to a series of agreements signed by the Palestinians with Israel in the 1990’s – the 1993 Oslo Accords, the 1997 Hebron Protocol, and the 1998 Wye River Memorandum.

However, by cancelling the Oslo Accords, could the Palestinian Authority be abolishing itself?

If Abbas is referring to the entire Oslo Agreement, it would in a way mean the dissolution of the Palestinian Authority, since they emerged from that agreement. Abbas’s reaction was caused not only by the intention of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to annex large areas of the West Bank on July 1, but also by the visit of U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to Israel, who undoubtedly supports the move.

Security coordination with Israel, which Palestine could be giving up, is one of the most important aspects of the Oslo Agreement, which has become a cornerstone of the so-called peace process. Security coordination is essential for the day-to-day functioning of both the Palestinian Authority and Israel. The Palestinian Authority is highly dependent, in daily terms, on this cooperation with the Israeli authorities. And not only on security, but also on economics, as well as on the inflow of financial resources, which come from the Israeli government to Palestinian institutions.

Even in earlier announcements, despite the interruptions, the essential parts of the implementation of coordination were never questioned. Abbas is now more serious than before when he announced and threatened to sever security ties which could be a blow to Israel, even if it means the Palestinian authorities lose the legal basis of its existence in international eyes.

Secretary of the Palestinian Fatah organization, Fayez Abu Aita, said that in these circumstances breaking all agreements, including the Oslo peace agreement, was absolutely necessary – this is the only way to protect their territories.

“It is not our fault that we are now on the edge of a new stage, a new great confrontation with Israel. Only by breaking all obligations with Washington and Tel Aviv, Palestine has the chance to defend its right to exist, the right to own land. After all, we said that we would not allow the implementation of the Deal of the Century. The Israeli government only heard itself and its greed. But this was only the first step: the further the Israeli side goes, the more serious the Palestinian response will be,” he said. “There is nothing else left for us, considering how quickly Israel extends its hands to our land. They were the first to bring the situation to a dangerous dead end.”

If Israel annexes the West Bank, hopes of creating an Arab state within the 1967 borders will be extinguished.

While the U.S. supports Israel’s annexation, Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday in a telephone conversation with Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazim confirmed the readiness of Russia to further promote the resumption of the peace process between Palestinians and Israelis. Russia is trying to prevent the annexation and, through diplomatic means, gather an international quartet with the participation of the UN.

Effectively Russia could be using this as an opportunity to present itself as a peace broker in the Palestine-Israel conflict. Whether this will be successful or not remains to be seen, but is necessary when it appears there is a strong chance that the Palestine-Israel conflict can breakout extremely violent again in the coming weeks amidst the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic.

If anything, it seemed like it would be one of the last states to turn to the secular left. That is, until it voted for Obama in 2008.

Many thought it was just a phase. After all, Indiana, also a solid Republican state, voted for Obama as well. After all, Obama was still socially conservative at the time. The trend however, continued. The Democratic Party went on to win the state in the next two presidential elections, along with the governorship and most other executive positions. In 2019, a second blue wave swept the state, removing Republicans from many local positions and giving the Democrats almost complete control over the state.

Many wonder how such a solid Republican, culturally conservative state located in the south could possibly have flipped so suddenly. Many believe it is the migration of unionized government workers along with Latin American immigrants that caused the shift. Regardless, a recent election has shown that the trend may be reversing.

Staunton is a small city located in the more populous northern region of Virginia. It was a part of the wave that resulting in Barack Obama winning the state in 2008. Since then, it has continued to contribute to the state turning blue.

A recent election, however, seemed to show something different. In a series of local elections, Republicans were able to flip numerous city council seats and regain control over the city council. Although Democrats ultimately received more votes than they did in the previous election, Republican turnout soured to unprecedented levels. A Virginia political analyst, Chris Graham of the Augusta Free Press, had described the results as “stunning almost beyond words.”

These results may suggest that although the Democrats haven’t lost voters to the GOP, many working class whites are being energized to vote for the GOP.

The recent policies enacted by Governor Northam are far from popular among that demographic. Anti-gun measure being pushed by the Democratic government resulted in pro-gun protestors filling the streets. Strict coronavirus lockdowns, similar to those implemented in New York and Michigan, are also angering much working class as well.

Of course, one local election in one small city isn’t enough to determine the political leanings of an entire state. It does, however, raise the question of the Democratic Party’s popularity and the mobilization of the white working class, a demographic that is continuing to become more and more significant despite is reduction in the overall share in the population.

All of this has been more or less led and spurred on by one Dr. Anthony Fauci. We reported three weeks ago on some rather amazing accounts suggesting that this doctor was somehow connected to the research programs in a “chimeric virus” containing strains of SARS, HIV and other goodies to produce a supervirus – one that is incurable. That research program was ongoing in the United States before the government got wind of it and shut it down, rightly so, since it was a program designed to bring about nothing but death. However, the allegation goes, Fauci managed to channel money illegally to Wuhan, China, to a lab there to further the research, and it is that virus, the causal agent of COVID-19, that we all have come to know and roundly hate.

So goes the allegation. It seems like wackadoo conspiracy theory still to me, but there is some interesting detail behind it, so it is possible that there are at least several true elements. However, Dr Fauci works for President Trump on the Coronavirus Task Force, and of late, the President has been ignoring the good doctor’s “for your own good” advice more and more. On Friday, May 22, the doctor did a reversal from his long-held course that we must be isolated until the end of time (and our media controlled) and suggested that isolation for too long may do “irreperable harm… including to our own health.”

Yeah. We knew that already. Ask anyone who has been riding this thing out in their home for the last two months. Do you feel better now? Now, granted, we have done a lot to adapt to the present pandemic, but the rhetorical churn and froth over how this is being handled, and how and what the virus itself does is such that for the last week or two, it has been extremely difficult to know what to report on here. The only constant about COVID-19 seems to be the never-ending stream of unqualified nonsense (we have stronger words for that, you know) that have everyone who tries to stay informed jumping and paranoid… or, has them finally coming to the conclusion that seems to be true:

Nobody really knows.

It would be okay if someone, anyone, in leadership said this honestly and continuously, as a preface for trying to establish some sort of common ground. We know less about COVID-19 than the experts act like, and the increasingly political nature of the handling of the pandemic is far more dramatic than the pandemic itself has turned out to be.

The video included with this article shows the response of one entertainer, Dave Portnoy, who has been skeptical of Dr Fauci’s position for a long time. After Dr. Fauci suddenly whipsawed to a different point of view (in truly Orwellian splendor, without acknowledging he was wrong), Dave does not let him get away with it.

If nothing else, the video ought to help all of us blow off some long-built-up steam.

The World Bank warns that there is a global poverty increase as tens of millions of people have fallen back into poverty because of the pandemic. Up to 60 million people worldwide may fall into extreme poverty due to the coronavirus, said David Malpass, head of the World Bank.

“Our estimate is that up to 60 million people will be pushed into extreme poverty, erasing all the progress made in poverty alleviation in the past three years, and our forecasts indicate a deep recession,” Malpass said on Tuesday.

According to him, the bank is trying to help people by providing loans in 100 countries and pledged to provide $160 billion in loans up to mid-2021. Malpass did add that these efforts were not enough. He called on creditor countries to join the G20 initiative – a ban on debt repayment for some developing countries.

The most severe challenges are developing countries. It has been predicted that in Africa tens of millions of people will earn less than the minimum income, that is, below the poverty line. But in many ways, the function of these forecasts is that they show what will happen if we do nothing. It will be difficult to prevent the development of this scenario, but with the joint efforts and cooperation of the whole world, there are legitimate grounds to prevent the most negative consequences.

However, we imagine that poverty only increases in the developing world. Morgan Stanley investment bank found that the global economy will only return to pre-crisis state in the third quarter of 2021. Deutsche Bank even launched more pessimistic forecasts – by the end of next year, developed countries’ GDP will be $1 trillion lower than 2019.

The World Trade Organization has warned that international trade will experience the deepest recession since World War II. The International Monetary Fund on April 14 said the total damage will be greater than the bank’s assessment. As stated by IMF chief economist Gita Gopinat, we are talking about $9 trillion dollars. According to the IMF, by the end of 2020, the global economy will lose 3%. This is a significant amount considering that during the Global Financial Crisis in 2009, the downturn was 0.08%.

This has exposed that the liberal global economic order is extremely vulnerable. The U.S. economy will fall by 5.9%, firstly by a quarterly sharp decline. Based on JPMorgan’s forecast, this index will reach 40%. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg believe Europe will lose 8.3% of its GDP in the next few months. In total, from January to July, this figure will reach 10% and by the end of the year will be 5.2%. Italy and Spain will suffer the most, with GDP declines of 7.3% and 5.7%, respectively.

Pre-coronavirus data found that in the U.S. 16.2% of children lived in poverty, that is almost 1 in 6 children, with 2.5 million children experiencing homelessness in 2015. 29.9% of Americans live close to poverty while 5.3% of the population live in deep poverty. In addition, in 2018, 11.1% of American households, were food insecure, meaning they had difficulty providing enough food for all people within the house. Earlier this month the unemployment rate in the U.S. reached 14.7% with the Federal Reserve estimating it could reach a high of 25%. With the coronavirus devastating the U.S. and global economy, it can only be expected that these shocking poverty figures in the world’s richest and most powerful country will only increase significantly – this is not a problem only for the developing world.

Despite the increasing poverty and unemployment, there has been no discussion on significant scaling back the U.S.’ global militarism. In 2015, the U.S. had around 800 military bases in 50 foreign countries with 250,000 soldiers spread between them. There is little suggestion that these statistics have changed since then.

The U.S. is continuing its aggression around the world by orchestrating coup attempts in Venezuela, continual backing of jihadist groups in Syria, and sanction regimes against several countries. It appears as the U.S. economy continues to decline and large segments of the American people go deeper into poverty or enter destitution, Washington has no plans to carry out cost saving measures by reducing its monopoly of foreign bases around the globe or drawback its aggression against non-compliant independent states.

In January 1961, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower used his farewell address to warn that “an immense military establishment and a large arms industry” had emerged as a hidden force in U.S. politics and that Americans “must not fail to comprehend its grave implications.” Despite Eisenhower’s warning, it appears the American people have failed to understand its implications as profits for arms industries has taken precedence over poverty reduction that was caused by the failures of the Western liberal economy in handling the corovirus pandemic. The U.S. hegemony of foreign military bases and perpetual war is one to serve the profits of private arms companies at the expense of the American people.

President Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed,” a public-private partnership to develop a vaccine and ready it for mass production by early 2021, has generated anti-vaccine concerns among some Americans, a new survey finds.

The survey, published via Reuters/Ipsos on Thursday, found 25% of Americans have no interest in taking a coronavirus vaccine.

About 36% of respondents said they would be less willing to take a vaccine if President Trump said it was safe. Only 14% said they would be interested.

Reuters/Ipsos surveyed 4,428 Americans between May 13-19 said they would need to review additional research on the vaccine to determine if it was safe.

A little less than 66% were “very” or “somewhat” interested in a vaccine if made readily available.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, told Reuters, considering there are 92,000 virus-related deaths, he thought there would be a much higher amount of people that would want the vaccine.

“It’s a little lower than I thought it would be with all the attention to COVID-19,” said Schaffner. “I would have expected somewhere around 75 percent.”

The survey found 14% were not interested at all, 10% were not very interested, and 11% were unsure about subjecting themselves to a vaccine.

Health experts tell Reuters that, “at least 70% of Americans would need to be immune through a vaccine or prior infection to achieve what is known as “herd immunity,” when enough people are resistant to an infectious disease to prevent its spread.”

President Trump’s Operation Warp Speed program aims to produce 300 million doses of a vaccine by January, a goal that we’ve said is widely unrealistic.

The president’s constant hype of vaccines has led some people to believe many of the drugs in development are being rushed and could have dangerous side effects. Ron Paul recently warned “rushed-into-production” vaccines for other viruses have had disastrous health consequences for some people.

Nearly 84% of respondents said vaccines for measles are safe, suggesting that people are doubtful about a rushed vaccine for COVID-19. Of the folks who were “not very” interested in taking the vaccine, 29% of them said they would reassess their thoughts once the FDA approved it.

Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, where his staff is currently developing a vaccine, said:

“It’s not surprising a significant percentage of Americans are not going to take the vaccine because of the terrible messaging we’ve had, the absence of a communication plan around the vaccine and this very aggressive anti-vaccine movement.”

The poll underlines how political divides among Democrats and Republicans predate the pandemic, but lockdowns have since catalyzed new divides and exacerbating old ones. That being, nearly 20% of Republicans said they had no interest in a vaccine, which was more than double the proportion of Democrats who said the same.

With creepy billionaire Bill Gates and big government rushing vaccines into development and for possible mass production next year — the anti-vaccine movement in America continues to grow.

Latest polling data shows governing parties in the UK, Germany, Italy and France have had a popularity boost during national lockdowns.

“This is the most serious crisis that has hit Europe since the Second World War,” said Daniele Albertazzi, a political scientist from the University of Birmingham.

“It is quite well-known that in times of crisis, people do tend to rally behind the flag and the government of the day.”

Some European governments’ use of wartime metaphors could also have helped them to avoid scrutiny and maintain their popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic by convincing people they needed to come together to defeat the virus.

“Governments have been very shrewd and clever in exploiting this and using metaphors that remind people of war-time periods, so the virus has become an enemy that the population has to defeat by pulling together.”

“Right now people on the streets are saying that this is not the moment to have a go at the government.”

Matthew Goodwin, a political scientist at the University of Kent, said that during moments of crisis “voters tend to rally around their incumbents”.

“This is especially likely to occur when voters face a big external ‘threat’, like terrorism and now a pandemic. I think the wartime rhetoric encouraged this, but we would most likely have seen a rally effect regardless,” Goodwin said.

Boris boost?

According to Opinium, the popularity of the UK’s ruling Conservative Party jumped from a 49% share before the lockdown was introduced, to 54 per cent afterwards. The main opposition Labour Party saw its figures drop by 4 per cent over the same period.

The Conservative Party’s leap in popularity could be explained by the rallying around the flag effect detailed by Albertazzi and Goodwin.

But it could also be linked to sympathy towards UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was hospitalised with COVID-19 on April 5 — around the time the party’s fortunes peaked — and later spent time in intensive care.

Speaking in mid-March, Johnson said of COVID-19: “This is a disease that is so dangerous and so infectious that without drastic measures to check its progress it would overwhelm any health system in the world.

“I have used the Italian health system, it is excellent, and the problem is not the health system, it’s the numbers of sufferance.

“That is why we announced the steps yesterday that we did – advising against all unnecessary contact – steps that are unprecedented since world war two.

“We must act like any wartime government and do whatever it takes to support our economy.”

Macron and Merkel make gains

Meanwhile, in France, President Emmanuel Macron’s ratings improved by an average of 10% after the country imposed a national lockdown on March 17.

The numbers have fallen over the course of the lockdown, but Macron still enjoys marginally higher ratings than before the COVID-19 pandemic.

During his speech to impose lockdown, Macron repeatedly used the phrase “nous sommes en guerre (“We are at war”).

But the most noticeable increase in support for the government is in Germany, where the CDU/CSU of Angela Merkel has risen, since the start of March, from a 24% to a 38% vote share.

Meanwhile, no other major political party in Germany has seen an increase in ratings, and Die Grunen (Greens) have fallen 7%, according to the survey institute, Kantar Emnid.

How did leaders in Italy and Spain fare?

Support for Italian Prime Minister, Giuseppe Conte, has also increased, while the ruling social democratic parties in Denmark, Sweden and Portugal had all improved by at least 4% in opinion polls by the end of March.

In Spain, public opinion in Pedro Sanchez’s Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) fell in the week before the national lockdown was introduced on the March 14, but has since slowly improved in April, according to ElectoPanel.

PSOE’s coalition partner Unidad Podemos has nevertheless seen a slight fall in opinion, but support has been steadily growing each week for Pablo Casado’s Partido Popular.

Will it last?

Analysts are suggesting these good numbers for governments will not sustain as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.

This “rally effect” of public support for incumbents “does now seem to be tailing off as voters begin to question their governments,” said Goodwin.

“Emmanuel Macron and Donald Trump, for example, are now suffering in the polls more than they were at the start of the crisis. This is important because we know that perceptions of competence -is a leader competently managing an important issue?- are very important to how people vote,” Goodwin added.

“You can see in countries like Italy, Switzerland, and Finland that there has been a short period of truce between governments and opposition or more radical and more moderate parties,” said Albertazzi.

“As weeks go past, people will start realising the enormous financial effect of the crisis and more and more stories emerge about the mishandling of the pandemic and the big mistakes that were made by governments”.

Populists fall but will return soon

Europe Elects data has also shown that a number of populist parties across Europe have fallen in opinion polls.

Matteo Salvini’s Lega Nord has fallen by roughly 4% since February, while VOX España, Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) and Marine le Pen’s Rassemblement National in France also suffered a decrease.

“Radical and populist parties seemed to have initially accepted that they needed to tone down their criticisms of governments or their opponents,” Albertazzi told Euronews.

But analysts do expect that populists will resume their communications soon, even though there are significant risks.

“It is easy to have a go at governments, opponents or the European Union,” said Albertazzi. “But there is certainly a risk that populists might jump on the bandwagon of criticism too early and misjudge the mood of the public.”

“This is a crisis of such huge proportions that we may still be in the stage where the public and business associations want to see more unity and division.”

But Albertazzi also noted that it is politically important for populist parties to change their stance as soon as possible.

“They have to demonstrate that they have remained fundamentally different from what they see as traditional parties, which they accuse of sticking to the same recipes.

“It is important that the voting public can see populists and radicals as something different, who are not taming their communications strategy.”

“When the immediate crisis passes and politics returns to some sense of normality, politicians are going to have to deal with the hangover,” said Euronews’ political editor Darren McCaffrey.

“More questions will be asked about how they dealt with the health crisis and how exactly they can help their economies bounce back while trying to get public finances in order.”

Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov has been hospitalized in Moscow with a suspected coronavirus infection, Interfax reported Thursday.

Kadyrov, 43, was reportedly flown to the Russian capital Wednesday, a few days after reporting flu-like symptoms, the Baza Telegram channel reported earlier Thursday. Chechen doctors recommended that Kadyrov seek treatment there after his “condition began deteriorating rapidly,” Baza said.

The Telegram channel cited medical data as saying that Kadyrov has been diagnosed with lung damage and a suspected Covid-19 infection.

“He is under doctors’ supervision,” Interfax cited its source as saying.

A well-known transport tracker said Thursday that a private jet linked to Kadyrov arrived at Moscow’s Vnukovo Airport from the Chechen capital of Grozny.

Kadyrov’s official page on Russian social network Vkontakte has posted several updates in the past 24 hours, including posts on his charitable donations and birthday greetings for Russia’s defense minister, but has not yet addressed his alleged infection.

Kadyrov was last active on his Telegram account on Tuesday, while Instagram blocked his page last week.

Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been voted the UK’s ‘most impressive’ politician according to a recent poll. The survey, carried out by Press Gazette, asked 2700 people who they thought was doing best at handling the current crisis. Sturgeon came out top, with 29% of the vote, ahead of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and Labour opposition leader Keir Starmer. The poll follows on from a recent Scottish Government survey which gave Nicola Sturgeon a rating of 84% for her slow and measured approach to lockdown. For in defiance of Westminster’s lifting of lockdown restrictions earlier this month, Scotland has until now kept them in place, only hinting recently that some may be lifted on 28th May.

The statistics regarding Sturgeon’s performance will not come as a surprise to many, given the contrast with her Westminster counterpart. Boris Johnson has faced a barrage of criticism in recent weeks over his handling of the coronavirus pandemic in Britain. And with the highest death rate in Europe, and second highest death toll in the world, it’s no surprise that questions are being raised. Yet the PM has of late, not provided the consistent, strong leadership required at this time. In contrast to his Scottish counterpart, who gives a daily briefing on the Covid-19 situation in Scotland, without fail; Boris Johnson has not given a press conference for days, and has not been seen in public for days, prompting #WhereisBoris to trend on Twitter. The difference between the two leaders could not be greater; every time Boris puts a foot wrong, it boosts Sturgeon, and the case for Scottish independence.

Unlike the Scottish government, which has yet to make any change to the current social distancing guidelines, other than being able to leave home now twice a day for exercise – instead of once as previously stated – Boris Johnson announced last week that people from different households could now meet; that if required, workers could return to work, and that from 1st June some shops would reopen and some pupils would return to school. The messaging also changed – rather confusingly, from ‘Stay Home’ to ‘Stay Alert’ – with no-one quite clear as to what the latter actually means. The motivation for beginning to lift lockdown measures is no doubt, mainly, economic, with experts warning that the UK is headed for a recession like no other. But there are concerns that Johnson has acted too soon, as with the death toll rising to the virus every day, we could be faced with another ‘peak’ if we return to normality too soon.

For the reality is the virus is still with us, and is likely to remain with us for years to come. Boris Johnson himself gave the example of SARS, for which, he highlighted, a vaccine has not been found in the last 18 years. Although scientists across the globe are working tirelessly in a bid to discover a vaccine as soon as possible, there are no guarantees that they will succeed in the short term. The key in the meantime, will be testing – both for those infected with coronavirus and for immunity, with antibody testing. But the UK government has only recently started to take testing seriously. Early on in the pandemic it downplayed the importance of it, favouring ‘herd immunity ’instead. This was in contrast to countries like China and South Korea that saw testing as a vital way of managing the crisis. Back then, Britain’s Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir Patrick Vallance, said ‘We think this virus is likely to be one that comes year on year, becomes like a seasonal virus. Communities will become immune to it and that’s going to be an important part of controlling this longer term. About 60% is the sort of figure you need to get herd immunity’. Britain has paid dearly for this ‘laissez-faire approach.

The case against the UK government is building by the day. Aside from the overall death toll of 35, 341, it has been established that an additional 23,000 deaths took place this year in care homes. Far from putting a ‘protective ring’ around care homes as Health Minister Matt Hancock has said, the government has been accused of putting a ‘noose’ around them, with elderly patients effectively like sitting ducks in the wake of the pandemic. It has been observed that no real attempts were made to prevent the spread of coronavirus throughout Britain’s nursing homes, with patients regularly admitted into homes from hospital, without being tested for the virus. Recently it was even reported that Personal Protective Equipment originally intended for care homes was diverted to NHS hospitals. Justice Secretary Robert Buckland admitted on Wednesday that : “We needed to make a choice about testing, we did decide to focus upon the NHS.’

Choices indeed have been made. And increasingly, questions are being raised as to whether the right decisions have been taken – both before and during the pandemic. For at a time when the country is ‘clapping for carers’ every week, in a display of public support for NHS staff, the government is passing its immigration bill, targeting the very migrants who play such an important role in Britain’s health service. As MP Valerie Vaz put it: ‘With this immigration bill the government is effectively clapping them out of the country’. Indeed the harsh reality of Tory policy cannot be escaped during this pandemic. The under-funding of public services over the years, particularly the NHS, primarily by the Conservative government is manifesting itself during this crisis like at no other time. We have entered an era where capitalism is under more strain than ever, where the only solution to this crisis comes from state interference – with the transport industry to care homes to universities all set to require substantial financial aid to survive. A different Britain will emerge from the pandemic.

As for Scotland, it must decide whether it wants to continue being at the receiving end of Tory policies which favour business over people, or whether it will finally carve out for itself a fairer society with welfare at the fore. With a resurgence of coronavirus potentially looming on the horizon, I know which society I’d prefer to live in…

Given the very noticeable rise in threatening rhetoric focused on Iran over the past week, it seems thoughts of regime change in Tehran are once again top of the agenda. Or perhaps simultaneously the administration needs a significant distraction of sorts amid the coronavirus pandemic, and the persistent national reopening question and agenda.

On Wednesday, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo went gloves off on Twitter, attacking Iran’s ‘Supreme Leader’ Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, blasting him as “anti-Semitic”, “disgusting” and as someone representing “hate speech,” according to Pompeo’s remarks.

The United States condemns Supreme Leader Khamenei's disgusting and hateful anti-Semitic remarks. They have no place on Twitter or on any other social media platform. We know Khamenei’s vile rhetoric does not represent the Iranian people’s tradition of tolerance. pic.twitter.com/cfBhyOfFa9 — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) May 20, 2020

He announced new sanctions on the Iranian government, specifically targeting the Minister of Interior, Abdolreza Rahmani, as well as top intelligence officials, for leading protest crackdowns and human rights violations.

But Pompeo didn’t stop at Iran, in follow-up tweets coming just minutes and hours apart calling out the “dictatorial Castro regime” as well as Maduro, urging “peaceful democratic transition for Venezuela” — or again in other words regime change.

Two years ago today, Maduro showed the Venezuelan people and the world that there can be no free and fair election while he occupies Miraflores Palace. The Democratic Transition Framework provides a roadmap for peaceful democratic transition for Venezuela. https://t.co/eB5TDZIuBk — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) May 20, 2020

Within a few hours he issued no less than nine tweets targeting Iran, Cuba, and Venezuela. On Cuba the US top diplomat called out the “Castro regime” who has “trampled the rights of the Cuban people”.

“I salute the brave Cubans who continue the fight for democracy and prosperity. The United States stands with you,” he added.

Today, Cubans celebrate their independence, yet the struggle for freedom continues. The dictatorial Castro regime has trampled the rights of the Cuban people. I salute the brave Cubans who continue the fight for democracy and prosperity. The United States stands with you. — Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) May 20, 2020

White House and State Department briefings have been COVID-19 focused of late, whether on the domestic front or abroad — where the administration has been in a blame-game war of words with China over the virus origins and accompanying economic shutdown — but Wednesday’s Pompeo tweet rampage strongly suggests he’s ready to get back to the business of regime change.

Recall that last summer was dominated by ‘tanker wars’ in the gulf and Mediterranean. It appears we’re in for another hot one.

Everything’s fine if it fits the narrative, Bloomberg Opinion editors might have thought when they misquoted World Bank statistics on the number of hospital beds per 1,000 residents, including the misrepresented data in a Russia-bashing op-ed by Clara Ferreira Marques, titled ‘How Putin’s Russia Bungled the Pandemic’.

Taking a swipe at Russia’s efforts to upgrade the Soviet healthcare system to make it less cumbersome and more effective, the piece argued that the endeavor failed, only leading to a drop in hospitals, beds available, and doctors.

To back up the premise, the article featured a graph claiming to be based on 2013 data from the World Bank. However, according to the World Bank’s actual stats, while Russia had over twice as many beds in 2013 (8.2 versus 3.8 per 1,000), the initial version of the Bloomberg story had Russia lagging far behind the OECD countries by the same margin.

The blunder did not go unnoticed by the Russian Embassy in the US, which accused Bloomberg of promoting a new barrage of “politicized allegations” with “fake” stats.

“We demand that Bloomberg Opinion refute, apologize and respect its own customers,” the embassy said in a Facebook statement.

We are convinced that readers and viewers of the leading American media deserve verified, but not deliberately distorted, information.

Several hours after the embassy voiced its protest, Bloomberg Opinion amended the article, embedding a correct version of the graph instead of the misleading one.

The blunder came just days after Bloomberg ran another story about Covid-19 and Russia that raised some eyebrows. “Experts Want to Know Why Coronavirus Hasn’t Killed More Russians,” the initial headline stated, in what many commenters saw as the outlet’s disappointment in the country’s relatively low death toll. It has since been changed twice to sound more neutral.

Other Western media outlets seem to be taking the same misleading doom-and-gloom approach in covering Russia’s fight with the epidemic. Last week, CNN declared Moscow “devastated” based on the number of identified cases, which came with increasingly large-scale testing.

Meanwhile, the New York Times and Financial Times seem to imply that the Russian government is covering up the damage done by the epidemic with the creative use of official mortality statistics. The mystery of Russia’s low death toll was thus “solved” by the Western press. But when the Russian Embassy in the US tried to have the New York Times print comparative statistics for Moscow, New York City, and London to give readers some proper context, it refused, according to the diplomats.

On September 20, 1950, a US navy ship released a bioweapon into the air just off the coast of San Francisco in a deliberate attempt to experiment with its own population. The experiment resulted in at least one death and countless other infections. No one was prosecuted. In fact, the mainstream media almost completely ignores this piece of history.

Despite popular claims, Project MKUltra is not a conspiracy theory. According to documents uncovered under the Freedom of Information Act, the government illegally experimented on humans to discover means of mind control. Techniques that were used included high doses of psychoactive drugs, electroshocks, sensory deprivation, electroshocks, isolation, sexual abuse, and other forms of torture. These experiments were not just done on prisoners, it was done to innocent American citizens without their consent, including doctors, military personnel, and members of the general public. This information can all be found in wikipedia.

In one well known incident, government researchers, without informing the men they had the diseases, studied the effects of syphilis on African Americans. Afterwards, they deliberately withheld treatment to the men.

In addiction, there are countless other examples of incidents similar to those mentioned above.

After the sars outbreak in 2002, the United States government funded a collaboration of Chinese scientists and the US military from a bioweapons lab in Dort Detrick. Fort Detrick was the center of the U.S. biological weapons program from 1943 to 1969. After the program was discontinued, it served as the host for most elements of the United States biological defense program. It was also the grounds for Project MKUltra.

In 2002, Chinese scientists and a team of American scientists led by none-other than Dr. Fauci, teamed up to study the viruses effect on bat tissues. In addiction, they created what is called pandemic superbots. These were strains that were intentionally created to be more lethal than the strains occurring naturally. The fear of these strains being released alarmed other researchers. One Harvard professor told the Time magazine that Dr. Fauci’s work was intentionally weaponizing the virus. Despite this, Dr. Fauci’s work continued to be subsidized by the US government. Yes, I said the US government, not just the Chinese government.

Over the years, there were various incidents that resulted in the new weaponized virus from nearly being released. In response, in 2014, the US government terminated Fauci’s federal funding. This decision, however, did nothing to stop Fauci’s research. Instead, it just shifted the blame away from the US government over to the Chinese government. The research was then shifted to a military lab in a particular place in China. That place was Wuhan. Once the research was moved to Wuhan, the United States government reinstated its funds to the dangerous research. The amount given is thought to be around $3.7 million, although it is likely that it could be much higher.

Bat rectal swap research was also apart of Dr. Fauci’s research. Remember that the virus was alleged to have came from bats.

Three years later, in 2017, Dr. Fauci did an interview in which he claimed President Trump would face a global pandemic. “The history of the last 32 years that I have been the director of the NIAID will tell the next administration that there is no doubt they will be faced with the challenges their predecessors were faced with… We will definitely get surprised in the next few years.”

Indeed, we were surprised. Three years later, a virus similar to the SARS outbreak came about in the same place Dr. Fauci was creating another coronavirus strain at the same time he claimed a global pandemic would break out. Almost immediately after, the man in charge of these research is appointed to advise President Trump. Is this a coincidence? That’s up for you to decide.

If it is true that this virus was intentionally created and released by the United States, it is also worth noting why. There are many reasons to why the United States and China would intentionally release a bioweapon on its own populations. One theory is that the bankers and investors that control the United States government are using this crisis to dethrone the dollar as the world’s reserve currency, replacing it with an IMF based world currency. This currency would be used to even further their control over our monetary system and increase their wealth even more. We have already seen the United States unofficially endorse a IMF backed world currency. That however, can be discussed another time.

Regardless, these revelations should result in some serious questions being asked, including why the media has completely ignored this information and continues to hail Dr. Fauci as a hero.
