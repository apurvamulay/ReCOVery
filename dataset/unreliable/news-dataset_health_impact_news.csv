Editor, Health Impact News

Those of us who have been covering the dark side of the medical industry for the past decade or so are fully aware that the medical system kills more people in the U.S. than any disease, using the medical system’s own data.

This is seldom, if ever, published in the corporate media which is largely funded by the pharmaceutical industry today.

The other fact that is well-known to most of us in the alternative media is that the pharmaceutical industry leads the U.S. in criminal fraud.

According to the Department of Justice (DOJ) website, the pharmaceutical industry is the largest offender of criminal fraud based on settlements and judgments for the False Claims Act.

From 2009 through 2016, Health Care Fraud resulted in $19.3 billion for fraud, with “billions more during the same period for state Medicaid programs and in criminal fines and forfeitures.” (Source.)

Housing and Financial Fraud was a distant second during the same time period, at $7 billion.

In 2017, according to the DOJ:

Of the $3.7 billion in settlements and judgments, $2.4 billion involved the health care industry, including drug companies, hospitals, pharmacies, laboratories, and physicians. This is the eighth consecutive year that the department’s civil health care fraud settlements and judgments have exceeded $2 billion.

In 2018, settlements and judgments for fraud against the health care industry again exceeded $2 billion according to the DOJ:

Of the $2.8 billion in settlements and judgments recovered by the Department of Justice this past fiscal year, $2.5 billion involved the health care industry, including drug and medical device manufacturers, managed care providers, hospitals, pharmacies, hospice organizations, laboratories, and physicians. This is the ninth consecutive year that the Department’s civil health care fraud settlements and judgments have exceeded $2 billion. The recoveries included in the $2.5 billion reflect only federal losses but, in many of these cases, the Department was instrumental in recovering additional millions of dollars for state Medicaid programs.

Richard Smith, editor of the British Medical Journal until 2004, wrote an opinion piece in 2013 about a book published by Peter Gøtzsche, the head of the Nordic Cochrane Centre, entitled “Deadly Medicines and Organised Crime: How Big Pharma Has Corrupted Healthcare.”

The characteristics of organised crime, racketeering, is defined in US law as the act of engaging repeatedly in certain types of offence, including extortion, fraud, federal drug offences, bribery, embezzlement, obstruction of justice, obstruction of law enforcement, tampering with witnesses, and political corruption. Peter produces evidence, most of it detailed, to support his case that pharmaceutical companies are guilty of most of these offences. (Source.)

The “largest fraud settlement in U.S. history” was against a pharmaceutical company:

On July 2, 2012 the British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline pled guilty to three counts of criminal misdemeanor and other civil liabilities relating to the prescription drugs Paxil, Wellbutrin and Avandia, and agreed to pay a total of $3 billion in fines–$1 billion to settle criminal charges, and $2 billion to cover civil liabilities. The payment is the largest fraud settlement in U.S. history, and the largest fine ever paid by a drug company. (Source.)

And these are the people we are being asked to trust to provide a COVID-19 cure with a new vaccine, when there is not convincing evidence that we even have an accurate test that can identify this “new” coronavirus.

Investigative reporter Jon Rappoport reminds us just how deadly medicine actually is.

Who pushes the Idea of an epidemic; what are their crimes?

“It is simply no longer possible to believe much of the clinical research that is published, or to rely on the judgment of trusted physicians or authoritative medical guidelines. I take no pleasure in this conclusion, which I reached slowly and reluctantly over my two decades as an editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.” –Marcia Angell, MD (“Drug Companies and Doctors: A story of Corruption.” NY Review of Books, Jan. 15, 2009.)

With my coverage of the so-called pandemic, we are seeing many new readers showing up and paying attention. So I want to expose a few facts about the modern medical system—facts I’ve presented many times over the past 10 years.

I do this because of a little thing called REPUTATION. If the track record of major medical officials were really understood, people would ignore their current pronouncements with barely a glance. Pronouncements like: THE VIRUS IS SPREADING; THIS IS A MAJOR EPIDEMIC; WE’RE TESTING A NEW PROTECTIVE VACCINE AND EVERYONE MUST TAKE IT.

I also expose facts because MEDICALLY CAUSED DEATH is routinely swept under the carpet by the mainstream press. Actually, as a result of media silence, the subject of medical harm is where the subject of grossly poisoned food was in the 19th and early 20th centuries. At that time, giant food processors had created their own Wild West, where they could sell lethal poison (eat, fall down dead) hidden in products. The press helped expose these crimes and transfix the public, which led to partial reforms. Now, in the medical arena, the press is a partner in capital crimes.

Major medical officials have been sitting on a time bomb. The range of medical maiming and killing is astonishing.

Imagine a Congressional hearing held before media cameras, with reporters all over the world ready with shocking facts about one of the leading causes of death—

SENATOR: Sir, I have the mainstream medical death numbers in front of me. How can you keep this secret from the public?

FDA COMMISSIONER: It’s not a secret, sir. Many experts know about it.

SENATOR: I’m looking through the trillion-dollar federal budget. I’m looking for the money allocated to fix this horrible situation. Where are those funds?

FDA COMMISSIONER: Nowhere. Don’t blame us.

SENATOR: Why not?

FDA COMMISSIONER: Because we can never be dismantled. We’re eternal. God created the FDA. God created the CDC.

I know major media won’t investigate medically-caused death numbers, because I’ve published reports for years, and I’ve contacted news people with the facts; and nothing happens.

So we begin with a few citations.

July 26, 2000, Journal of the American Medical Association; author, Dr. Barbara Starfield, revered public health expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health; “Is US health really the best in the world?”

Starfield reported that the US medical system kills 225,000 Americans a year. 106,000 as a result of FDA-approved medical drugs, and 119,000 as a result of mistreatment and errors in hospitals. Extrapolate the numbers to a decade: that’s 2.25 million deaths. You might want to read that last number again.

I interviewed Starfield in 2009. I asked her whether she was aware of any overall effort by the US government to eliminate this holocaust, and whether she had ever been contacted by any government agency to consult on such an effort. She answered a resounding NO to both questions. She also said her estimate of medically caused deaths in America was on the conservative side.

Here is another citation: BMJ June 7, 2012 (BMJ 2012:344:e3989). Author, Jeanne Lenzer. Lenzer refers to a report by the Institute for Safe Medication Practices: “It [the Institute] calculated that in 2011 prescription drugs were associated with two to four million people in the US experiencing ‘serious, disabling, or fatal injuries, including 128,000 deaths.’”

The report called this “one of the most significant perils to humans resulting from human activity.”

The report was compiled by outside researchers who went into the FDA’s own database of “serious adverse [medical-drug] events.”

Therefore, to say the FDA isn’t aware of this finding would be absurd. The FDA knows. The FDA knows and it isn’t saying anything about it, because the FDA certifies, as safe and effective, all the medical drugs that are routinely maiming and killing Americans. Every public health agency knows the truth.

Here is another citation: The article is, “The Epidemic of Sickness and Death from Prescription Drugs.” The author is Donald Light, who teaches at Rowan University, and was the 2013 recipient of ASA’s [American Sociological Association’s] Distinguished Career Award for the Practice of Sociology. Light is a founding fellow of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania. In 2013, he was a fellow at the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard. He is a Lokey Visiting Professor at Stanford University.

Donald Light: “Epidemiologically, appropriately prescribed, prescription drugs are the fourth leading cause of death, tied with stroke at about 2,460 deaths each week in the United States. About 330,000 patients die each year from prescription drugs in the United States and Europe. They [the drugs] cause an epidemic of about 20 times more hospitalizations [6.6 million annually], as well as falls, road accidents, and [annually] about 80 million medically minor problems such as pains, discomforts, and dysfunctions that hobble productivity or the ability to care for others. Deaths and adverse effects from overmedication, errors, and self-medication would increase these figures.” (ASA publication, “Footnotes,” November 2014)

—Another study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association on April 15, 1998: “Incidence of Adverse Drug Reactions in Hospitalized Patients.” It, too, is mind-boggling.

The authors, led by Jason Lazarou, culled 39 previous studies on patients in hospitals. These patients, who received drugs in hospitals, or were admitted to hospitals because they were suffering from the drugs doctors had given them, met the following fate:

Every year, in the US, between 76,000 and 137,000 hospitalized patients die as a direct result of the drugs.

Beyond that, every year 2.2 million hospitalized patients experience serious adverse reactions to the drugs.

The authors write: “…Our study on ADRs [Adverse Drug Reactions], which excludes medication errors, had a different objective: to show that there are a large number of ADRs even when the drugs are properly prescribed and administered.”

So this study had nothing to do with doctor errors, nurse errors, or improper combining of drugs. And it only counted people killed who were admitted to hospitals. It didn’t begin to tally all the people taking pharmaceuticals who died as consequence of the drugs, without being admitted to hospitals. (Note: none of the studies and reviews I’m citing in this article include damage and death as a result of vaccines.)

The statistics I’m quoting reveal a human problem on the level of a tsunami sweeping across the whole of America and Europe.

Why won’t major media outlets report these facts and pound on their significance?

The obvious reason: their big-spending pharmaceutical advertisers would drop them like hot potatoes.

But there are other reasons.

Every medical bureaucrat or medical shill or medical expert who jumps aboard the media train, to assure the public that drugs and vaccines are remarkably safe, is sitting on the time bomb I have described above.

If this bomb were widely recognized, who would continue to believe these professional pundits? Who would accept anything they say? How could they possibly sustain their credibility?

“Well, the system I represent kills 2.25 million people per decade, and maims between 20 and 40 million more people per decade, but I want to assure you this vaccine presents no problems at all. It’s incredibly safe.”

Every single pronouncement, on any subject, issued via the medical cartel’s Ministry of Truth (major media), would fall on disbelieving ears, and only increase general outrage.

Mainstream reporters and editors and publishers are well aware that telling the truth would undermine a basic institution of society.

The media are there to give credibility to society and its structures. That’s why they’re called “major” instead of “minor.”

When hard rains fall, the media are there with an umbrella to hold over organized society’s head. To walk away in the middle of a downpour would leave the status quo unprotected.

“Defending the Crown” is another way to put it. The King may make mistakes, he may commit heinous offenses, but he is the King, and therefore his position must remain secure.

Young journalists learn this point quickly. If in their zeal, they cross the threshold and attempt to expose a central myth, fairy tale, legend, they’re put back in their place. They absorb the message. Journalism has limits. Certain truths are silent truths.

Over the years, I’ve talked to reporters who are solidly addicted to obfuscations. Like any addict, they have an army of excuses to rationalize their behavior.

The medical experts are worse. Their pretense of idealism knows no limits, and is matched only by their fatuous claim to bullet-proof knowledge.

When you peel the veneer away, they are enablers, persons of interest, co-conspirators.

There is nothing quite like a high-minded, socially-positioned, card-carrying member of the King’s circle of protectors. The arrogance is titanic. Because what is being hidden is so explosive.

It is the duty of the Crown to make his subjects feel safe and protected and even loved.

No wonder he needs such a large army of trained helpers in and around the press.

He has them.

But their monopoly is breaking down.

We’re in a new breakout level of truth. It’s called independent media.

So…on the subject of epidemics, when public health officials, and their government enablers, and the compliant press, and doctors tell us that a new virus is sweeping the world, a vaccine will stop it, and we must take that vaccine…why should anyone fall in line and accept their words?

Professional liars, professional criminals may pretend they are spouting science, but they are merely relying on the ignorance of the public.

It may interest you to know that the US system of reporting severe adverse effects of vaccines is broken. There are no reliable numbers.

Barbara Loe Fisher, of the private National Vaccine Information Center, has put together a reasonable estimate:

“But how many children have [adverse] vaccine reactions every year? Is it really only one in 110,000 or one in a million who are left permanently disabled after vaccination? Former FDA Commissioner David Kessler observed in 1993 that less than 1 percent of doctors report adverse events following prescription drug use. [See DA Kessler, ‘Introducing MEDWatch,’ JAMA, June 2, 1993: 2765-2768]” “There have been estimates that perhaps less than 5 or 10 percent of doctors report hospitalizations, injuries, deaths, or other serious health problems following vaccination. The 1986 Vaccine Injury Act contained no legal sanctions for not reporting; doctors can refuse to report and suffer no consequences.” “Even so, each year about 12,000 reports are made to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS]; parents as well as doctors can make those reports. [See RT Chen, B. Hibbs, ‘Vaccine safety,’ Pediatric Annals, July 1998: 445-458]” “However, if that number represents only 10 percent of what is actually occurring, then the actual number may be 120,000 vaccine-adverse events [per year]. If doctors report vaccine reactions as infrequently as Dr. Kessler said they report prescription-drug reactions, and the number 12,000 is only 1 percent of the actual total, then the real number may be 1.2 million vaccine-adverse events annually.”

Medical illiteracy in the population—the public health experts and the pharmaceutical titans feast on it. It allows them to get away with mass murder every day.

For those who think murder is too strong a word, I’ll close with this: it’s simple—when you’re in a profession that keeps killing and maiming people at a tragic and astonishing rate, and you know it and do nothing about it, you’re guilty. Period. No amount of evasion or excuse changes the fact.

THESE are the people telling you to believe their story about a pandemic. THESE are the people claiming the village has to be blasted in order to save it.

An independent media publisher named “Grace” who goes by reallygraceful on YouTube has produced what is the best documentary on the history of Bill Gates that I have seen so far.

I have never met Grace, and Health Impact News does not necessarily agree with all of her commentary (we don’t necessarily disagree either!), but these 3 short videos, which have been very well produced, come with plenty of references to document the things she is revealing, and we will copy the references here as well, before YouTube removes these videos.

Please contact us if the videos do disappear, and we will provide an alternative platform to view them.

Also, the Social Media tech giants are suppressing much of our traffic these days on places like Facebook, and our emails also are increasingly being blocked, so be sure to read my article about how to use RSS feeds to continue receiving our articles.

Editor, Health Impact News

On Monday this week (May 18, 2020) Moderna put out a press release stating that they had seen positive results to the first phase of their COVID-19 vaccine trial.

The news sent their stock prices surging, as the pharmaceutical company is working with Dr. Anthony Fauci and the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases which Fauci heads.

However, that all changed on Tuesday, May 19, 2020, when Stat News published an article stating that Moderna did not produce any data to back their claims.

Heavy hearts soared Monday with news that Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate — the frontrunner in the American market — seemed to be generating an immune response in Phase 1 trial subjects. The company’s stock valuation also surged, hitting $29 billion, an astonishing feat for a company that currently sells zero products. But was there good reason for so much enthusiasm? Several vaccine experts asked by STAT concluded that, based on the information made available by the Cambridge, Mass.-based company, there’s really no way to know how impressive — or not — the vaccine may be. While Moderna blitzed the media, it revealed very little information — and most of what it did disclose were words, not data. Even the figures the company did release don’t mean much on their own, because critical information — effectively the key to interpreting them — was withheld. (Source.)

Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. also published his own observation on the little bit of data that was disclosed via his Instagram Account:

CATASTROPHE! Moderna Vaccine has 20% “Serious” Injury Rate in High Dose Group

Moderna’s cheery press release this morning, the clinical trial results for its groundbreaking COVID vaccine could not be much worse. The vaccine, developed and championed by Anthony Fauci and financed by Bill Gates, used an experimental MRNA technology that the two men hoped would allow rapid deployment to meet President Trump’s ambitions “warp speed” time line. Dr Fauci was so confident of his shot’s safety that he waved ferret and primate studies (Moderna suspiciously reported no health data from its mouse studies.) That appears to have been a mistake. Three of the 15 human guinea pigs in the high dose cohort (250 mcg)suffered a “serious adverse event” within 43 days of receiving Moderna’s jab. Moderna did not release its clinical trial study or raw data, but its press release, which was freighted with inconsistencies acknowledged that three volunteers developed Grade 3 systemic events defined by the FDA as “Preventing daily activity and requiring medical intervention.” Moderna allowed only exceptionally healthy volunteers to participate in the study. A vaccine with those reaction rates could cause grave injuries in 1.5 billion humans if administered to “every person on earth”. That is the threshold that Gates has established for ending the global lockdown. Moderna did not explain why it reported positive antibody tests for only eight participants. These outcomes are particularly disappointing because the most hazardous hurdle for the inoculation is still ahead; challenging participants with wild COVID infection. Past attempts at developing COVID vaccines have always faltered at this stage as both humans and animals achieved robust antibody response then sickened and died when exposed to the wild virus. Moderna’s press announcement heralded “Positive Interim Phase 1 findings”. I have forwarded that claim to my colleagues in securities law; FTC rules restrict the amount of lipstick public companies may slather on bad donkeys.

The U.S. Government has invested about half a million dollars in the Moderna experimental COVID vaccine so far.

Now today, Thursday May 21st, while record numbers of Americans in the millions and climbing are without jobs, UK drug company AstraZeneca has announced that it has received $1.2 BILLION from the U.S. Government to receive 300 million vaccine doses starting this fall of a COVID-19 vaccine that is still in development and not even approved yet.

Excerpts:

Only days after Moderna reported positive early results for its potential COVID-19 vaccine, AstraZeneca has stolen the spotlight back. On Thursday, the U.K. drug giant scored a $1.2 billion contribution from the United States for development, production and delivery of its potential shot starting this fall. The vaccine, developed by the University of Oxford’s Jenner Institute, contains the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. It isn’t replicating, so it can’t cause an ongoing infection in recipients, AZ says. The company hopes the vaccine can deliver a strong immune response from one dose by triggering the body to produce the spike protein and attack the novel coronavirus upon infection. AstraZeneca has signed up to deliver 400 million doses through its initial supply agreements. The United States deal—through the HHS’ BARDA agency—follows a U.K. pact unveiled Sunday for 100 million total doses. That gives the U.S. delivery of about 300 million vaccine doses starting this fall. BARDA, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, says the money is “intended to help enable the Operation Warp Speed goal of making doses available by the end of 2020 and additional doses by the end” of the first quarter of 2021. President Donald Trump unveiled the “Warp Speed” program at a Rose Garden event late last week.

As Health Impact News reported last week, President Trump appointed Dr. Moncef Slaoui, the former chairman of GlaxoSmithKline’s vaccines division, as Chief Adviser for Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s project to fast-track a COVID-19 vaccine.

Dr. Slaoui is yet another Big Pharma leader Trump has added to his medical advisors with ties to Bill Gates, and has previously worked on vaccine development with his other medical advisors, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx, and CDC Director Robert Redfield who all worked together with Bill Gates in the past to develop an HIV vaccine. See:

While the future of a COVID-19 vaccine is still uncertain, one thing is very clear: a vast majority of the wealth of the United States is being transferred to Big Pharma as thousands of businesses are now closing down due to the COVID-19 scare while the U.S. Government gives hundreds of BILLIONS (maybe over $1 TRILLION now??) to Big Pharma, for ventilators, face masks, hospitals and hospital ships, COVID-19 tests that are not even accurate, and the list goes on and on….

What does it mean?

by Dr. Sherri Tenpenny, DO, AOBNMM, ABIHM

Vaxxter.com

In 1965, scientists identified the first human coronavirus; it was associated with the common cold. The Coronavirus family, named for their crown-like appearance, currently includes 36 viruses. Within that group, there are 4 common viruses that have been causing infection in humans for more than sixty years. In addition, three pandemic coronaviruses that can infect humans: SARS, MERS, and now, SARS-CoV-2.

As the news of deaths in China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran began to saturate every form of media 24/7, we became familiar with a new term: COVID-19. To be clear, the name of the newly identified coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2, short for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2. This virus is associated with fever, cough, chest pain, and shortness of breath, the complex of symptoms that form the diagnosis of COVID-19.

The Trump administration declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, then on February 2 placed a ban on the entry of most travelers who had recently been in China.

On February 4, Alex Azar, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a declaration of public health emergency and activated the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, otherwise known as the PREP Act. This nefarious legislation provides complete protection of manufacturers from liability for all products, technologies, biologics, or any vaccine developed as a medical countermeasure against COVID-19. For those nervously waiting for the vaccine to become available, be sure to understand the PREP Act before rushing to the get in line.

Calls for testing – to see if a person is or isn’t infected – began soon after the emergency was declared, but performing those tests was initially slow due to an inadequate number of test kits. As the kits became available, those developed by the CDC had a defect: The reagents reacted to the negative control sample, making the test inaccurate and the kits unusable.

In various countries, thousands of test kits purchased from China were found to be contaminated with the SARS-CoV-2 viruses. No one really knows how that happened, but theories spread like wildfire.

Could the test kit infect the person being tested? Or, did it mean the test would return a false-positive result, driving up the numbers of those said to be infected so those in power could implement stronger lockdowns and accelerate the hockey-stick unemployment rates? Neither of those questions has been adequately answered.

Mandatory Testing…of what?

Authorities claim that testing is important for public health officials to assess if their mitigation efforts – “shelter in place” and “social distancing” and “wearing a mask” – are making a difference to “flatten the curve.” Officials also claim that testing is necessary to know how many persons are infected within a community and to understand the nature of how coronaviruses spread.

Are these reasons sufficient to give up our health freedom and our personal rights, being tested and shamed in public?

Despite the challenges with test kits, testing began. By the end of March 2020, more than 1 million people had been tested across the US. By May 9, the number tested had grown to over 8.7M. Testing methods include a swab of the nasal passages or by inserting a long, uncomfortable swab through the nose to scrape the back of the throat. Specimens have also been obtained bronchoalveolar lavage, from sputum, and from stool specimens.

The call for mandatory testing has been gathering steam and becoming ever more onerous. In Washington state, Governor Inslee has declared:

Individuals that refuse to cooperate with contact tracers and/or refuse testing, those individuals will not be allowed to leave their homes to purchase basic necessities such as groceries and/or prescriptions. Those persons will need to make arrangements through friends, family, or state provided ‘family support’ personnel.

But what do the results really mean?

Who Should Be Tested

On May 8, 2020, the CDC has listed specific priorities for when testing should be done. As of May 16,more than 11-million samples have been collected and more than 3700 specimens have not yet been evaluated.

High Priority

Hospitalized patients with symptoms

Healthcare facility workers, workers in living settings, and first responders with symptoms

Residents in long-term care facilities or other congregate living settings, including prisons and shelters, with symptoms

Priority

Persons with symptoms of potential COVID-19 infection, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, vomiting or diarrhea, and/or sore throat

of potential COVID-19 infection, including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, vomiting or diarrhea, and/or sore throat Persons without symptoms who are prioritized by health departments or clinicians, for any reason, including but not limited to public health monitoring, sentinel surveillance, or screening of asymptomatic individuals according to state and local plans.

Read that last priority again: That means virtually everyone can be required to get a test.

Is that a violation of your personal rights? And, if you submit to testing, what does a “positive test” actually mean?

Types of Testing: RT-PCR

PCR, short for polymerase chain reaction, is a highly specific laboratory technique. The key to understanding PCR testing is that PCR can identify an individual specific virus within a viral family.

However, a PCR test can only be used to identify DNA viruses; the SARS-CoV2 virus is an RNA virus. Therefore, multiple steps must be taken to “magnify” the amount of genetic material in the specimen. Researchers used a method called RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, to specifically identify the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It’s a complicated process. To read more about it, go hereand here.

If a nasal or a blood sample contains a tiny snip of RNA from the SARS-CoV-2 virus, RT-PCR can identify it, leading to a high probability that the person has been exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

However – and this is important – a positive RT-PCR test result does not necessarily indicate a full virus is present. The virus must be fully intact to be transmitted and cause illness.

RT-PCR Testing: The Importance of Timing

Even if a person has had all the symptoms associated with a coronavirus infection or has been closely exposed to persons who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the probability of a RT-PCR test being positive decreases with the number of days past the onset of symptoms.

According to a study done by Paul Wikramaratna and others:

For a nasal swab, the percentage chance of a positive test declines from about 94% on day 0 to about 67% by day 10. By day 31, there is only a 2% chance of a positive result.

the percentage chance of a positive test declines from about 94% on day 0 to about 67% by day 10. By day 31, there is only a of a positive result. For a throat swab, the percentage chance of a positive test declines from about 88% on day 0 to about 47% by day 10. By day 31, there is only a 1% chance of a positive result.

In other words, the longer the time frame between the onset of symptoms and the time a person is tested, the more likely the test will be negative.

Repeat testing of persons who have a negative test may (eventually) confirm the presence of viral RNA, but this is impractical. Additionally, repeated testing of the same person can lead to even more confusing results: The test may go from negative, to positive, then back to negative again as the immune system clears out the coronavirus infection and moves to recovery.

And what makes this testing even more confusing is that the FDA admits that

“The detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR does not necessarily equate with an infectious virus.”

Let’s break that down:

You’ve had all the symptoms of COVID19, but your RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 is negative.

Does that mean you’re “good to go” – you can go to work, go to school or you can travel? OR…

Does that mean your influenza-like illness was caused by some other pathogen, possibly one of the four coronaviruses that have been in circulation for 60 years? OR…

Does that mean the result is a false-negative and you still have the infection, but it isn’t detectable by current tests? OR…

Does that mean it was a sample was inadequately taken due to the faulty technique by the technician? OR…

Does that mean you have not been exposed, and you are susceptible to contracting the infection, and you need to stay in quarantine?

So, what does a “positive” test actually mean? And that’s the problem:

No one knows for sure.

Another Type of Testing: Antibodies

According to the nonprofit Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), more than 200 serologic blood tests, to test for antibodies, are either now available or in development.

There are two primary types of antibodies that are assessed for nearly any type of infection: IgM and IgG. While several new testing devices are being touted as a home test, they are not the same as a home pregnancy test or a glucometer to you’re your blood sugar. The blood spot or saliva specimen can be collected at home, must it must then be sent to a laboratory for analysis. It can take a few days – or longer – to get the results. With so many tests in the pipeline, the ability to test at home will be changing over time.

The first antibody to rise is IgM. It rises quickly after the onset of the infection and is usually a sign of an acute, or current, infection. The IgM levels diminish quickly as the infection resolves. The FDA admits they do not know how long the IgM remains present for SARS-CoV-2 as the infection is being cleared.

The interpretation of an IgG antibody is more difficult. This antibody is an indicator of a past infection. The test is often not specific enough to determine if the past infection was caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus or one of the four common coronaviruses that cause influenza-like illness.

The FDA says:

Because serology testing can yield a negative test result even if the patient is actively infected (e.g., the body has not yet developed in response to the virus) or maybe falsely positive (e.g., if the antibody indicates a past infection by a different coronavirus), this type of testing should not be used to diagnose an acute or active COVID-19 infection.

Similarly, the CDC says the following regarding antibody testing:

If you test positive: A positive test result shows you have antibodies as a result of an infection with SARS-CoV-2, or possibly a related coronavirus. It’s unclear if those antibodies can provide protection (immunity) against getting infected again. This means that we do not know at this time if antibodies make you immune to the virus. If you have no symptoms, you likely do not have an active infection and no additional follow-up is needed. It’s possible you might test positive for antibodies and you might not have or have ever had symptoms of COVID-19. This is known as having an asymptomatic infection [ie you have a healthy immune system!] An antibody test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19.

If you test negative If you test negative for antibodies, you probably did not have a previous infection. However, you could have a current infection because antibodies don’t show up for 1 to 3 weeks after infection. Some people may take even longer to develop antibodies, and some people may not develop antibodies. An antibody test cannot tell if you are currently sick with COVID-19.



What? Wait!

Doesn’t the vaccine industry call the IgG a “protective antibody”?

Isn’t this the marker of immunity they assess after you’ve had an infection with measles or chickenpox or mumps to determine if you are immune to future infections?

Isn’t this the marker of induced immunity they are trying to achieve by administering a vaccine?

If the FDA does not know if an IgG antibody to SARS-CoV-2 after recovering from the infection is protective against a future infection, then they certainly don’t know if an antibody caused by a vaccine will prevent infection either.

Doesn’t this completely eliminate the theory that antibodies afford protection and antibodies from vaccines are necessary to keep you from getting sick?

Mandatory Testing – New Job Creation

Illinois U.S. Rep. Bobby L. Rush introduced the H.R. 6666 TRACE Act on May 1. On his website, Rush said,

Until we have a vaccine to defeat this dreaded disease, contact tracing in order to understand the full breadth and depth of the spread of this virus is the only way we will be able to get out from under this.

H.R.6666 would authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Director of the CDC to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing and then to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals. The contact tracers would be authorized to test people in their homes and as necessary, quarantine people in place.

Where do they intend to do this testing? Besides mobile units to test people in their homes, the bill identifies eight specific locations where the testing and contract tracing could occur: schools, health clinics, universities, churches, and “any other type of entity” the secretary of HHS wants to use.

The bill would allocate $100 billion in 2020 “and such sums as may be necessary for fiscal year 2021 and any subsequent fiscal year during which the emergency period continues.”

But what are they looking for?

Is your test supposed to be positive – saying you’ve been exposed and you’ve possibly recovered?

– saying you’ve been exposed and you’ve possibly recovered? Or is your test supposed to be negative , meaning, you are healthy?

, meaning, you are healthy? Or does a completely negative test – negative RT-PCR test and no IgG antibody mean you’re susceptible to infection and you need to stay in quarantine?

The virus is rapidly mutating, which is rather typical of RNA viruses. In a study published in April 2020, researchers have discovered that the novel coronavirus has mutated into at least 30 different genetic variations. If your RT-PCR test is positive, does this identify exposure to the pandemic virus or exposure to one of the genetic variations? The same can be said about the vaccines under development: With each mutation, is the vaccine more likely to be all risk and no benefit when it reaches the market?

What You Can Do

Across the nation, police are being told to not apprehend criminals but instead, to arrest parents at playgrounds, to arrest lone surfers on public beaches, to fine ministers and congregation members sitting in their cars listening to a service on the radio, and to restrict movement by creating one-way sidewalks.

People have had enough. They are beginning to see the huge scam that has been perpetrated on the entire world over a viral infection with a global death rate of 1.4% (meaning, 1.4% of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a fatal outcome, while 98.6% recover). This is far fewer deaths than a severe flu season.

We’re already starting to see the thrust to take our power back:

In Virginia, people went to the beaches en mass, ignoring social distancing and the orders of the Governor to stay home.

and the orders of the Governor to stay home. The central California city of Atwater has declared itself a “sanctuary city,” allowing business owners and churches to open, openly defying Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s coronavirus-related stay-at-home order.

Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s coronavirus-related stay-at-home order. The truth about wearing masks is starting to come out and people are voting with their feet. Retired neurosurgeon, Dr. Russell Blaylock, warns that not only do face masks fail to protect healthy people from contracting an illness, but they create serious health risks to the wearer.

While they shut us down and held us hostage in our homes, they changed our society, our lives, our world. I am not willing to accept this is the “new normal.”

I won’t submit to testing.

I will refuse mandatory vaccination.

I will stop wearing a mask.

I will not be afraid of standing next to a friend or family member and will not obey the concept of “social distancing.”

I will understand that an asymptomatic carrier is a normal, healthy person and I will not buy into the fear that I might “catch something” from a normal, healthy person.

It’s time for Americans to resist with non-violent civil disobedience. Be brave. Be bold. Put on the full armor of God, as found in Ephesians 6:10-20 in the Bible, to stand against the world rulers of this present darkness. With God on our side, all things are possible.

OPPOSE H.R. 6666, the COVID–19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act

by the National Vaccine Information Center (NVIC)

Contact your U.S. Congressional Representative and ask them to vote NO on H.R. 6666

H.R. 6666, otherwise known as the COVID–19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone (TRACE) Act, was introduced and referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce on 5/1/2020.

This bill is sponsored by Representative Bobby Rush (D) of Illinois District 1. The bill has 59 cosponsors, 58 Democrats and 1 Republican. We need your help to stop this terrible bill.

Summary

H.R. 6666 provides 100 billion dollars this year and unlimited federal funding in future years to create and operate a massive and likely unconstitutional surveillance, testing, and tracing enforcement system under the guise of “protecting” Americans against coronavirus.

H.R. 6666 is a federal funding bill. It proposes to create a surveillance infrastructure that can be used by the federal government, as well as local and state governments and private businesses, to require medical testing and tracking of all citizens in violation of fundamental civil liberties as set forth in the Bill of Rights, which include the first 10 amendments to the U.S. Constitution designed to protect individual rights and limit the power of the government.

H.R. 6666 lacks safeguards and conditions related to funding of the proposed surveillance operation to prevent it from being applied to intrusive programs mandating testing and surveillance without an individual’s voluntary consent. If this legislation is passed by Congress and enacted into law, it could lead to denial of an individual’s right to appear in public spaces and travel; the right to employment and education or participation in government-funded services, and the right to receive care in a government funded hospital or other any other medical facility.

H.R. 6666 specifically allows for funded entities to home quarantine a person against their will, even while they are healthy. Once a vaccine is available, the testing and tracing results potentially could be used to force individuals to be injected with a COVID-19 vaccine against their will.

According to a Press Release from the sponsor Congressman Bobby L. Rush, “Reopening our economy and getting back to normal will be all but impossible if we do not step up our testing efforts and implement robust and widespread contact tracing,” said Rep. Rush. “Until we have a vaccine to defeat this dreaded disease, contact tracing in order to understand the full breadth and depth of the spread of this virus is the only way we will be able to get out from under this.”

The Devil is in the Details

H.R. 6666 would allow The Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to award federal grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID–19, to trace and monitor the contacts of infected individuals, and to support the quarantine of such contacts. Through the use of mobile health units, as necessary, individuals would be tested and provided with services related to testing and quarantine at their residences.

The amount of money appropriated for fiscal year 2020 would be $100,000,000,000 (one hundred billion dollars) and more money may be appropriated by Congress as necessary for any subsequent fiscal year during which the emergency period continues.

A grant recipient may use the federal grant funds, in support of the above referenced activities to hire, train, compensate, and pay the expenses of individuals; and to purchase personal protective equipment and other supplies.

Priority will be given to applicants in “hot spots” and medically underserved communities and to entities that hire residents of the community where the activity will occur. Hot spots are defined as a geographic area where the rate of infection with the virus that causes COVID–19 exceeds the national average. Medically underserved communities are communities given that term in section 799B of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 295p).

Entities eligible for the grant money are defined as a federally qualified health center, school-based clinic, disproportionate share hospital, academic medical center, nonprofit organization, institute of higher education, high school, and any other type of entity as determined by the Secretary of HHS.

H.R. 6666 Does Not Guarantee Privacy

Section 2 (e) of H.R. 6666 is entitled “Federal Privacy Requirements”, but it does little to protect privacy. It states that “Nothing in this section shall be construed to supersede any Federal privacy or confidentiality requirement, including the regulations promulgated under section 264(c) of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (Public Law 104–191; 110 Stat. 2033) and section 543 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 290dd–2).

In actuality, H.R. 6666 offers few privacy protections for Americans who will be surveilled and tested without their consent under programs funded with this grant.

In fact, Americans can expect their privacy to be violated under TRACE funded programs. That is because the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) 45 CFR 164.512(b)(1)(i) has always allowed disclosure of private health information to government officials and other government approved entities including foreign governments without the knowledge or consent of the individual for the purpose of conducting public health surveillance, investigations or interventions.

Bill of Rights Cannot Be Suspended During A “Public Health Crisis”

The Bill of Rights in the U.S. Constitution cannot be set aside by the federal government or state governments during pandemics or other public health emergencies. In The United States Statement of Interest in Support of Plaintiffs, filed by the Department of Justice (DOJ) in a case last month in which church goers attending a drive-in sermon were issued citations for violating an executive order in Mississippi, the DOJ stated;

“There is no pandemic exception, however, to the fundamental liberties the Constitution safeguards. Indeed, “individual rights secured by the Constitution do not disappear during a public health crisis.” In re Abbott, — F.3d —, 2020 WL 1685929, at *6 (5th Cir. Apr. 7, 2020). These individual rights, including the protections in the Bill of Rights made applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, are always in force and restrain government action.”

H.R. 6666 sets the stage for multiple violations of our constitutional rights.

The 4th Amendment right of American citizens is to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures.

The proposed law would provide government funding of entities that create and implement programs to trace and monitor healthy people potentially exposed to the coronavirus.

However, the bill does not allow individuals to exercise their Constitutional right to be safe in their homes free from warrantless government intrusion, and does not provide for voluntary refusal of testing and monitoring by a government funded entity.

The bill also does not set forth how the contacts of persons with COVID-19 will be traced and whether the Constitutional rights of those infected with COVID-19, as well as their contacts, will be upheld.

The 5th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution guarantees that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.

This legislation provides government funding of entities that will enforce testing and potentially enforce vaccination of healthy individuals, who are suspected of having come into contact with COVID-19 positive persons whether or not they are exhibiting symptoms, without requiring the voluntary consent of the individual.

The 8th Amendment prohibits cruel and unusual punishment of citizens. The proposed law provides government funding to entities that will create and implement programs that trace, monitor and support the enforced quarantine of healthy individuals, who are suspected of coming into contact with COVID-19 persons, whether or not they are exhibiting symptoms and whether or not they may already be immune.

The 9th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution bestows upon the people rights not specifically set forth in the Constitution. H.R. 6666 provides funding for entities to create and implement undefined “related activities” to COVID-19 testing and unnamed “other purposes.”

H.R. 6666 should be opposed because it provides federal funding to entities to create and enforce unrestricted surveillance, testing, tracing and quarantine mechanisms and has no set end date. There is simply no way to know how many inalienable rights protected under the U.S. Constitution could be infringed upon or taken away from citizens if this bill becomes law.

Dr. Andrew Kaufman may be the most censored doctor in the U.S. right now. His videos are removed and censored from YouTube very quickly.

Dr. Kaufman is so intelligent, and so articulate, that the “mainstream” media and medical authorities obviously fear him and his message, and they are doing everything in their power to suppress him.

This video (below) he did with Spiro Skouras, for example, was immediately removed from YouTube, although Spiro’s other videos remain for the most part (for now).

Andrew Kaufman is a medical doctor. Here is his full bio from his website:

In this interview with Spiro Skouras, you will most likely learn things you have never heard before about the COVID-19 pandemic. Dr. Kaufman will explain why this is all planned, and is not really about a dangerous virus at all, but a way to control people’s lives.

He will explain things about the new type of vaccine they are rushing so fast to develop, and what he believes is the real objective for this vaccine.

Dr. Kaufman has already paid a steep price to be a whistle blower, and he only expects it to get worse. He states:

This is the only important thing for me to do now, is to get this information out, so that we can prevent ourselves from living in a horrible, horrible future. I have two young children, and they are my main motivating factor, that I don’t want them to live in a world where they have no freedom. And that’s where we’re heading right now. And so whatever risks there are, they’re risks that I simply have to take. That’s why I am doing what I am doing. There have been things that have occurred. I have had consequences. I was let go from my regular psychiatry job because I refused to wear a mask. I have had several friends who are doctors or other health care professionals who have been very upset with me. (They’re) disappointed and won’t talk to me anymore. I knew that those risks were part of this. But that’s not what’s important. I’ll tell you that I would be happy to risk being taken to jail as well, because I’m not going to participate in any of these measures. I don’t wear a mask. I don’t stay at home. I respect other people’s rights to make their own choices. So I don’t go and get in people’s faces. But if anyone is willing to make eye contact and interact with me, I don’t observe any social distancing, (and so) any opportunity to hug someone, especially in public, I always take advantage of that, because I want to show people that actually all of these measures are really voluntary. Even Governor Cuomo has made a public statement that there’s nothing that they can do to enforce any of these measures and that they are voluntary. And I would like to encourage other people to make that decision, because if we rely on the authority to give us approval of how to exercise our freedom, they’re going to take more freedoms away, as they’ve been doing. So while I respect people that to go and protest at the City Hall or State Capital, they are coming from the right point of view, they’re just asking the authority figures, the government, to give them permission, when they don’t need permission from the government. They already have permission because they have inalienable rights. It’s not really a decision for me. It’s just what I feel that I have to do to preserve the way of life that I want to live for me and my children.

Many COVID drugs are failing. Natural medicine may hold the key—but can government cronyism be overcome? Action Alert!

A large analysis has found that antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine had no benefit for COVID patients, causing more deaths than standard care. Other pharmaceutical treatments are also turning out to be useless. Emerging evidence suggests that natural medicines like zinc, quercetin, and potassium could help, sometimes in conjunction with drugs, but the government refuses to acknowledge these benefits because nutrients aren’t as profitable for drug companies.

While hydroxychloroquine may be ineffective on its own, there are trials that have combined the drug with zinc. Zinc inhibits viral activity, but it is difficult to get high levels of zinc into cells. Hydroxychloroquine may help by aiding zinc’s entry into cells. Studies show quercetin may also do what chloroquine does with zinc but without toxic side effects. Some researchers believe that zinc in general is one of the most important things we can take both to avoid Covid-19 infection and treat it. Hydroxychloroquine comes with the usual laundry list of dangerous side effects, while quercetin could help prevent heart damage along with many other benefits.

Research indicates that many other natural medicines could help prevent or treat COVID-19.

It is known that big viruses rapidly exhaust potassium levels, which can be fatal. A Chinese study has confirmed this for Covid-19.

Editor, Health Impact News

The COVID-19 situation has drawn the attention of the world to the subject of “viruses.” What are viruses, how does one treat them, and other such questions are highly controversial with very many different viewpoints.

One fact that seems to be agreed upon by everyone, is that viruses, at least the kind of “influenza” type of viruses that are seasonal, are a problem in the winter months, but not so much during the summer months.

Since daylight hours are extended during the summer, most of the research on this topic has surrounded Vitamin D, a vitamin best obtained from the sun.

But there is much more to this topic of “light,” and its effect on human health, than just Vitamin D.

Given how much attention has been given to the “coronavirus” topic, it is time to look at this issue more closely to see if there are factors during the shorter daylight winter times that can be studied and understood to improve our health during this time, without always looking for a drug or vaccine to cure everything.

So I assigned this topic to Health Impact News independent researcher and writer Crystal Lauer. She took over a month to research the topic.

During that time, President Trump and a team of researchers working with William Bryan in the Science and Technology division of the Department of Homeland Security, announced results of some their own studies within their laboratory looking at the effects of “solar radiation” and its effect on the Coronavirus, which seems to confirm that some of the research presented in this article may apply to COVID-19.

Of course, since this is a preventive measure with no patented drugs involved, the studies were quickly condemned by the medical industry, and an off comment made about disinfectants was what the corporate-sponsored “mainstream” media decided to focus on instead.

While Crystal was hesitant at first to spend so much time researching this topic, being a busy homeschool mother, in the end she reported that based on her research, her family made some big changes to their lifestyles to take better advantage of the healing power of natural light, and as a result she reported:

We found that we all are sleeping better, have much more mental energy and are overall feeling far more relaxed, even in the midst of this pandemic.

The Influence of Natural and Artificial Light on Human Biology

by Crystal Lauer

Health Impact News

The eyes are not only the windows to the soul, but the window through which light influences our biology, and while the radiation absorbed through the eyes is particularly influential on our cells, scientists suggest it is not the only way light, whether thermal or non-native, is able to affect our health.

Human cells, and in general every living thing, are optimized by the sun’s broad full spectrum of solar radiation, which starts with the higher energy UV (ultra-violet) rays beginning in the invisible range, progressing through the visible range and ending with the red-to near-infrared at the far opposite side of the spectrum.

The thermal radiation from sunlight holds the complete variations of wavelengths needed to drive our metabolic processes, balance our endocrine system, power our mitochondria, strengthen and build our bones, produce beneficial levels of the hormones dopamine and melatonin and even help prevent pathogens from damaging our bodies.

The sunlight is also known as a Chronobiologic, signaling to non-vision related receptors in our system, the changes in seasons and environment. Approximately 125 million photoreceptors in your retina are neurons transforming light waves into electrical signals which are sent to the brain.

Morning sunlight, which has the most blue light in it, will increase alertness, improve cognitive function and suppress melatonin, the sleep hormone produced in the pineal gland, when exposure occurs within the first couple hours after rising.

The rays contained in the visible blue and ultraviolet parts of the spectrum, which vary in wavelength from 380 Nanometers to 500 nanometers, are largely responsible for synchronizing your body’s clock, or Circadian rhythm, to the 24-hour solar cycle, with their short highly active waves.

Sunlight Directly or Indirectly Influences Almost Every Process in our Physiology

Extensive studies suggest that mitochondria, the powerhouse of our cells, use the near-infrared radiation, which makes up 42 percent of the sun’s light, to produce Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), an organic compound that provides energy to the cell.

By altering the physical properties of the water inside the cell’s membrane, the body’s most prolific chromophore which is a molecule which absorbs light, red- to near-infrared (R-NIR) light turbo-charges chemical reactions which result in cellular energy, while largely down regulating reactive oxygen species(ROS), which are responsible for oxidative stress.

This means that at an atomic level, cellular respiration allows photons in both red- and near-infrared light to excite electrons. Theses electrons break up nitric oxide bonds which compete with oxygen and clear the way for hydrogen ions(H+) to make their way through the process which will eventually lead to them becoming ATP molecules more efficiently.

This influence of red-and-infrared light on the cellular respiration has shown to be beneficial for the reduction of inflammation and pain, to improve muscle and wound recovery and even affect athletic performance for the better.

Another Way the Natural Spectrum of Light Provides Health Benefits is Through its Influence on the Immune System

By now most people are aware of the importance of Vitamin D, an ancient signaling molecule which allows the human body to cope with the increased absorption from UVB rays as the seasons change and the solar radiation in the UV range becomes more abundant.

Sunlight is efficient in producing Vitamin D, being reliant on the number of photons from the sun’s rays which are able to penetrate the skin. The increase in clothes, body fat, the use of sunscreen and our overall fear of the sun has led to epidemic levels of clinically low Vitamin D (25-hydroxyvitamin D) circulating in the blood of the average individual, with numbers increasing only slightly in the summer months and falling again over the winter.

It is estimated that over a billion individuals worldwide are deficient in Vitamin D, making it a major medical health problem globally.

Part of the problem lies in the reduced exposure to adequate UVB, which is often unavailable in many regions, except for a noticeably short amount of the year. Other complications which limit exposure to Vitamin D producing solar light is overcrowded cities and polluted skies, which block the necessary UVB rays needed to create Vitamin D from cholesterol in the skin.

The fat-soluble essential vitamin, 25 hydroxyvitamin D, is necessary for proper bone mineralization, support of most metabolic functions, neuromuscular health and immune modulation.

This increase in Vitamin D production is supposed to be, in part, responsible for the decrease in viral illnesses during the summer months when the sun’s solar rays are more intense, and more people spend time outdoors in less clothes.

So, while uncoupled from the more prolific red-and-infrared spectrum of full solar radiation, high-energy short-wave UV can easily become damaging to the human body, but its overall benefits to the health of our organism is inarguable when used responsibly.

So why, over the past century, has much of the messaging concerning the sun revolved around the dangers of excessive sun exposure and not its benefits?

The effects of UVA radiation which penetrates deep into the skin tissue can, when used inappropriately, can lead to cancer indirectly through the production of harmful molecules like ROS ( reactive oxygen species) that deleteriously affect DNA or through the more direct damage done to DNA broken by UVB radiation, which is more commonly known to be responsible for sunburns, the breakdown of collagen, skin aging and the heightened risk of skin cancers.

But, while the WHO (World Health Organization) has declared the Sun, or more specifically ‘solar radiation,’ to be a group 1 carcinogen, they also acknowledge that lack of sun exposure is responsible for far more death and disease overall. Evidence strongly suggests that adequate amounts of Vitamin D3 are unable to be gotten though dietary means, leaving responsible exposure to the sun the best way to increase needed Vitamin D stores.

Still, with the prolific warnings to avoid the dangers of the sun screaming at us from bottles of sunscreen and lotions, commercials, medical websites and posters for more than half a century, it’s no wonder we eventually stopped questioning the message and, in large part, accepted the idea that nature was attempting to kill us through her thermal light.

Eventually many of us went inside our tightly-constructed homes, flipped on our cost-efficient LEDs, turned on our televisions, scrolled through our smart devices and avoided the obvious hazards which lurked just outside, happily safe from the sun and bathed in the comforting blue glow of technology.

But not all light is created equal, and some scientists are now worried at the amount of time people spend exposed to non-thermal light sources.

Appearances can be deceiving and while we perceive the combination of the colored light waves in the solar spectrum to be a white light, it’s really a combination of distinct colored light waves with varying lengths containing energy in the visible spectrum that scientists say ranges from 380 Nanometers at the blue end to approximately 780 nanometers at the red end.

“Blue” light, which makes up approximately one third of the visible light spectrum, is a short high-energy visible (HEV) wave.

It is also the predominate light wave represented in light-emitting diodes, better known as LEDs. Because they are highly efficient to the tune of decreasing energy requirements as much as 95 percent when compared to the older incandescent thermal light bulbs, LEDs have largely replaced their inefficient counterparts.

This single change to our indoor environments may be far more disruptive than proponents could have appreciated.

While the heat from the old incandescent and halogen bulbs was an infrared that bestowed beneficial health effects and balanced the spectrum of light, the new LED bulbs are a non-native EMF radiation source which some photo biologists are warning can lead to age-related macular degeneration, through damage to photoreceptor cells and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Because blue light exposure causes overproduction of ROS resulting in oxidative stress, the damage done by excessive exposure to these lights would also necessitate increased regenerative light exposure from the red- and near-infrared spectrum to balance it out, however, little red and no near-infrared is found in the LED spectrum.

Blue light exposure in the evening, which is common in the average household across the planet, is also responsible for suppressing melatonin production and increasing cortisol, ultimately confusing the biological day and night cycle, your circadian clock.

Melatonin is more than just the hormone instigated by your ganglion cells in your retina and produced in the pineal gland to help you sleep at night.

It is also a free radical scavenger, an antioxidant, an anti-inflammatory and a circadian modulator, among other thing.

Exposure to artificial light sources after the sun has set is linked to a variety of disorders and pathologies including breast cancer, neurological, psychiatric and metabolic disorders.

Researchers have even found that circadian disruption may cause structural changes to the brain, affect moods, decrease neurogenesis, cause impairments in learning and memory and even increase depression.

Interestingly, while white and blue light had a marked negative effect on the hippocampal region of the brain, red light had very little effect, making it a non-threatening light source.

According to Dr. Alexander Wunsch, a respected expert in the field of photobiology, clear incandescent bulbs are preferred for indoor lighting over the newer LEDs as they have a color rendering index equivalent to the sun’s, which is 100, and a color temperature that rarely exceeds 3000 kelvin(k).

By comparison, the sun is at 5,500 kelvin at its center, and natural light is approximately 2700 kelvin, LEDs on the other hand can run as high as 6,500 kelvin, without the thermal component, making them higher in color temperature than the sun, yet deceivingly clear and inviting.

The influence of light over our biology is unquestionable, yet the study into the extent and depth of that influence is still in its infancy.

Humans have adapted and thrived since the beginning of humanity beneath the watchful rays of the sun. Ancestrally we rose with the dawn and we slept when darkness fell, our only light, that of the moon, the stars and perhaps a glowing fire.

With fire lights CRI of 100 and a color temperature of 1900, this glow doesn’t affect the natural rise and fall of melatonin, and thus our biological clocks were set by the native rhythms of full spectrum light and the changing seasons which we were intimately connected to all year-round.

Modern life has given us undeniable advantages and innovations, but in the midst of this lies an unfortunate loss, with the severing of our connection to the natural rhythms and while we may be unconscious of the impact of this loss, our cells and our physiology are definitely not.

While this branch of science necessitates mature solutions such as blackout curtains, street lights whose design points its light towards the night sky to prevent leakage of light, LEDs which adjust their wavelength to mimic the progression of the daylight and shift into red after dark, and even glasses that use amber lenses to block the more harmful blue rays from indoor lighting and electronics, will more and more be used to negate damage being done through our constant exposure to light pollution?

For now, perhaps the easiest and best place to start with resetting your circadian clock and increasing your mitochondria’s ATP potential is to get out in the early morning sun for a good half hour to an hour, put your feet on the ground around noon and step out into the rays of the UVB rich light and let your body absorb and create plenty of Vitamin D, and then when night falls, put on your blue blocking glasses or eat by candle light and read a book rather than stare at an electronic blue back-lit device.

How Our Family has Benefited from Changes in our Routine

While researching this subject, I found myself compelled to make rather large changes in my daily routine, and that of my children.

Understandably, they were not terribly excited when I woke them up at dark o’clock to witness the sun’s triumphant return. But with bare feet pressed into the earth beneath their deck chairs, they silently watched the sun peek through the trees and eventually reveal herself completely.

The birds who arrived for their morning worms were as confused as the children by our presence in the yard and watched us suspiciously from the branches above.

But an odd thing happened over the course of the first week, we became addicted to this early morning rise and setting an alarm soon became unnecessary. After a few days, the birds and the squirrels showed up to greet us each morning and became so bold as to practically pull up a chair next to us.

I made it a point to do the majority of my work and the children’s work outside in the yard or on our porch in order to be exposed to natural light for the majority of the day, and we also decided to eat by candlelight each night and use red light before bed to help prevent the suppression of our natural melatonin wherever possible.

As a result, we found that we all are sleeping better, have much more mental energy and are overall feeling far more relaxed, even in the midst of this pandemic.

Perhaps, the most life-changing thing you can do right now, given the circumstances, would be to go outside and reset your internal clock, soak up (responsibly) some UVB and infrared rays to boost your immune system and turn off your LEDs after the sun goes down.

There has been much written lately about how the COVID-19 “pandemic” is being used as an excuse to usher in some kind of national “Medical ID” that could be used as a tool to control our daily activities, and be used as a requirement to do almost everything in society, from buying goods to travel to receiving medical treatment and beyond.

Such concerns are certainly legitimate given what we have seen so far in the “war against the invisible enemy” and the government’s reaction to this “war.”

But opportunists taking advantage of the COVID-19 responses who would love to track and control most aspects of your personal life are not simply restricted to a medical ID card.

I was recently in a store purchasing some grocery products, and the sign at the checkout said: “Due to the Coronavirus situation we are no longer accepting cash.”

This may seen like a minor inconvenience to most people, but Attorney James Rickards, an American lawyer, economist, and investment banker with 35 years of experience working in capital markets on Wall Street, has been warning about the “War on Cash” for years now. When the flow of cash is limited to digital money and the approval of banks, near total control of the population is much more easily accomplished.

Back in 2016 he wrote:

I’ve been warning investors for months about the war on cash. This war has been in full swing in Europe and the U.S. for a long time. Governments plan to use negative interest rates, confiscatory taxes and other techniques to rob savers of their wealth. In order to do this, they have to force savings into digital accounts at large government-controlled banks. As long as savers can hold cash, they can avoid many of these confiscation techniques. Therefore, governments must eliminate cash. The latest battleground in this war is India. In a shock announcement on Nov. 8, India declared that 500- and 1,000-rupee notes are no longer legal tender. Imagine that — the money in your wallet or purse is instantly made worthless by government decree. That’s what happened. There were limited exceptions for hospitals and gas stations. Naturally, gas lines formed everywhere, and some people rushed to hospitals to prepay for future medical care with now worthless bank notes. The other exception to worthlessness was if you deposited the notes in the bank. There you would receive “digital credit” in your account. Of course, the tax man was waiting at the bank to ask you where you got the money. Those without an acceptable answer can expect trouble from the Indian Revenue Service. this is not the end of the war on cash. It’s just the beginning. (Read the Full Article Here.)

As we have previously reported here at Health Impact News, doctors all across the world have seen great success in treating COVID-19 patients with high-dose intravenous Vitamin C therapy.

When we first reported on doctors doing this in China just after the Wuhan outbreak, Facebook tagged us as “Fake News” and took away our ability to advertise and boost any of our articles. See:

Since that time, we have reported on how many doctors and hospitals here in the U.S. have also successfully used the treatment. See:

Michigan Doctor Charged with Felonies for Treating Coronavirus Patients with Vitamin C

by Shane Trejo

Big League Politics

Excerpts:

A Michigan doctor has had his Metro Detroit clinic raided following allegations that he was “illegally” treating coronavirus patients with Vitamin C.

Dr. Charles Mok, who leads the Allure Medical Spa in Shelby Township, has been accused of committing health care fraud and conspiracy to commit health care fraud. He is being charged in federal court for these supposed crimes.

Mok is an advocate for treating coronavirus patients with Vitamin C in order to boost their immune systems while they fight off the virus. This has become a controversial notion, as hysteria proponents stand in the way of any treatment that does not involve forcing vaccine shots into millions of people.

Federal jackboots surrounded the Allure facility and raided it last week. They are claiming that his treatments do not qualify for Medicare reimbursements because they have not been rubber-stamped for approval by the Medical Mafia at the FDA. He is also being accused of conducting illegal vein treatment after all “non-essential businesses” were forced to close by an edict from Governor Gretchen Whitmer.

Mok announced on YouTube that “IV vitamin C is being used in hospitals across the country to treat the most advanced disease associated with COVID-19.” This may have prompted the feds to shut down his operation by brute force.

In this interview, Brian Hoyer — one of the primary consultants for my latest book, “EMF*D” — discusses how electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation may be impacting the COVID-19 epidemic and your infection risk. Many have raised questions about whether there is a connection between 5G and this pandemic.

In some ways, the connection between COVID-19 and 5G is a moot issue. In other ways, it’s not. Either way, it’s tangential to what you need to do now to protect yourself and your family from here on out. At the time of this interview, which took place March 31, 2020, a vast majority of those who have died from COVID-19 were elderly.

Those who died in China and Italy under the age of 50 have generally been encumbered with obesity, diabetes and hypertension, with insulin resistance being the common denominator. Very few under the age of 19 are affected.

That said, the infection appears to be more aggressive than influenza in older individuals, and the illness lasts longer than the regular flu. So, there’s enhanced virulence to this virus for some reason we yet do not understand. While unproven, one current theory is that EMF radiation — and the addition of 5G in particular — could be having an impact.

Electrification and Global Illness

Hoyer cites data from Dr. Arthur Firstenberg’s book, “The Invisible Rainbow,”1 in which he catalogued epidemiological evidence showing that as electrification of the world was implemented, throughout the course of history, viral pandemics ensued.

“The big one in there that’s been cited on the internet about possible connection to 5G is, if you go back to 1918 when the Spanish flu went around the world, that was when the first radio telegraphs were more widely used.

You see the Spanish flu popping up all over the world, but [not] in a way [that would suggest] we are passing it from person to person, but [it popped up on] one side of the world to the other side of the world very quickly.

Today, we wouldn’t know if that’s happening because we travel so frequently. And there are theories out there about how viruses actually transmit from person to person … That said, what we have is probably the unhealthiest population in the history of mankind … as far as chronic conditions … We also have more sterility …

But we also have more practices of separation and decontamination, and all of those things are better than ever before. So why is this virus spreading so rapidly?

I believe it has to be the terrain of the individual and also environmental stressors that are creating this perfect storm where a virus has an easy way to get into the body and can actually reproduce on the cellular level inside of the human body. Which is really how viruses work. It’s not the same as bacteria. I think a lot of people have that false sense that a virus is just a smaller version of a bacteria.”

Viral Pandemics Coincide With Increases in EMF Exposure

In his book, Firstenberg brings up this concept that there is a connection between EMF and influenza. And, this connection existed far before the advent and introduction of man-made EMFs, which probably happened in very small quantities in the late 18th century.

But, he also describes something called the maunder minimum, which lasted from 1645 to 1715. Essentially, this was a period of time when the sun was very quiet and had very few or no sun spots.

Then, in 1727, the number of sun spots increased to over 100 for the first time in over a century. Now, I know this is ancient history, but it’s important to understand that because in 1728, influenza arrived in waves over the entire planet and it was the first flu pandemic in almost 150 years.

So, this is the first hint, at least historically, that there might be a connection between EMF and viral illness because, in the solar flare, you’re going to have increased radiation. The next major pandemic was in 1889, and the interesting part of this, which Hoyer mentioned, is that this infection was established pretty much everywhere all at once.

We obviously did not have transcontinental flights the way we did in the current COVID-19 disease. It appears to have emerged in Wuhan City, China, where, incidentally, 5G had recently been rolled out, but millions of people traveled in and out of that area and on to other parts of the world.

Well, the 1889 epidemic took place at a time when we didn’t have the ability to travel very fast or far. Yet, the pandemic emerged very rapidly in widely scattered regions around the world. Interestingly, in 1889, we saw the emergence of what Firstenberg calls power line harmonics. According to Firstenberg, that changed the Earth’s magnetic field, ushering in the 1889 influenza pandemic.

Next, there was the Spanish flu of 1918, which also spread far more rapidly than it could or should have were it spread through travel. In 1918, radio was the emerging technology. Firstenberg’s revised edition also mentions 5G technology.

In summary, his book builds a case for the theory that increases in EMFs, natural or man-made, might make us more susceptible or sensitive to viral illnesses. If natural EMF exposures have the ability to influence our biology, it’s not so hard to imagine that man-made exposures might have an exponential impact. Hoyer adds:

“Things are happening now that have never happened before. We [have] a lot of people who are electrosensitive. One of the things they report is that … they feel sick during lightning storms with influenza-type symptoms. Flashes of lightning create a radio frequency. It’s called microwave sickness in the literature.

A lot of people call it electromagnetic hypersensitivity or electrosensitivity, but in a lot of the literature, you have to look up microwave sickness … Then you’ll find these references to when storms come, when solar flares are active, people are getting more and more symptoms.

Depression is a huge thing that happens when there’s more solar radiation and also during a full moon even. So, there’s a lot of natural electromagnetic radiation that happens. Most of that is gradual, but with the radio frequency (RF) lightning pulses, those are definitely a pulsed phenomenon … I think it’s in the kilohertz range. But it varies … it’s never the same frequency, it’s always different.

You’ll actually hear it when the lightning goes off and if you have a really sensitive meter, when you turn on and off light switches, you can hear the arcing and there’s an RF that transmits out from that arcing that happens … Solar flares … can affect all types of electronics and can cause electromagnetic interference, and that is technically in the kilohertz to megahertz range.”

We Don’t Know What We Haven’t Studied

A significant problem with man-made EMFs is that they’re pulsed. We are also surrounded by RF radiation, both analog RF signals from radio stations and pulsed RF signals.

“A lot of times I wonder, ‘What would a real study look like if you have the 50 Hz to 60 Hz modulation and the RF and everything?’ Usually, in these studies, they’re just testing one thing in a controlled environment.

They’re never testing the entire soup that we’re constantly bathed in as human beings. We’re the big experiment here and they’re just testing one thing at a time in this Western medicine type of fashion,” Hoyer notes.

With regard to COVID-19, underlying health conditions clearly appear to play a role. However, we don’t know whether the use of certain drugs might have a bearing on the severity of the disease and its outcome.

For example, while French doctors say they’ve noticed a pattern that patients given ibuprofen fared worse than those given acetaminophen, their findings have been largely ignored simply because there are no studies to prove it.

When did clinical findings become useless? If anything, clinical suspicions should be rapidly considered and acted upon during an active pandemic when time is of the essence. At this time, we really need to listen to the medical professionals in the field who are treating patients.

Link Between 5G Implementation and COVID-19 Hotspots?

During a March 12, 2020, lecture at the Health and Human Rights Summit in Tucson, Arizona, Dr. Thomas Cowan likely stunned the audience by bringing up a potential connection between 5G and COVID-19.

By and large, many of the areas hardest hit by COVID-19 have recently implemented 5G which, at least theoretically, might render residents more prone to serious infection by lowering their immune function.

Cowan also presents the theory that COVID-19 and other influenza epidemics are not transmitted from person to person but, rather, are the result of cellular toxicity, including but not limited to EMF-induced cellular toxicity.

To be clear, I’m not saying 5G spreads the infection or is a vector of infection. But by lowering your natural immune defenses and causing chronic inflammation, it is likely impairing your innate immune system’s ability to fight off the coronavirus. Naturally, this increased susceptibility to illness would apply to all disease, both acute and chronic, and would not be limited to COVID-19.

Exaggerated EMF exposure may well be a hidden variable that could be contributing to the reason why so many people get sick in particular areas. Intense EMF exposure could be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel’s back, meaning the factor that breaks the immune system.

“[Cowan] is a top-notch doctor, he’s on the cutting edge,” Hoyer says. “In that video, he talks about Wuhan as one of the testing grounds for 5G, where 5G was first implemented in China. And what’s interesting about Italy … is that Milan — the Lombardi area of Italy where two-thirds of the cases are — is considered the 5G capital of the European Union according to Vodafone, which is the big 5G carrier out there …

If you go on Vodafone’s website, you can see the 5G map, and it’s sprinkled throughout all Milan and Lombardi, that province up there. So that is definitely a more concentrated area. On top of that, you have all of the older population in Italy, and people that are likely fully buying into the Western medicine and are on [multiple] medications — those sorts of things.

The way that all of those medications are interacting, combined with the 5G stress and the electromagnetic stress, I think it’s no wonder everyone’s immune system is suppressed and they’re so susceptible. It’s the terrain that’s the problem, the environmental stress.

We can actually kind of control that ourselves. Getting off of our phones and working to shield our environment will help to strengthen our immune system. Then taking some … supplements can take to help boost your immune system …

So, there’s 5G in Milan, in Wuhan, and New York City is one of the highest, most intense [5G] areas I’ve seen, and Seattle … But 5G doesn’t matter so much to me. It’s about the intensity of the EMF. New York was basically as intense as a 5G area already, before 5G was implemented, in my opinion. It maxes out all of our meters wherever I go. There are hidden antennas everywhere in New York City.

[Seattle] has a lot of hills in the city, and right on Queen Anne, there are two huge radio towers with probably 100 antennas on them, just blasting the whole city. We’ve had assessments there where we’ve maxed out [our meters], and even shielded rooms upstairs and it still maxed out.

So, we have to do a complete covering of the floor, the ceiling and the walls, and be really strict about how we’re doing the shielding over the windows so that everything is sealed almost perfectly, like a true perfect Faraday cage. In most homes we don’t have to do an absolutely perfect Faraday cage, with all the electrical connections and no gaps whatsoever. We can still dial it down to where the levels are low enough.

But in places where it’s really intense, we have to use different strategies in order to make it so that there’s absolutely no gaps … The exponential pressure of all that EMF radiation that can leak in through a tiny hole is really important in those more saturated areas …

Some people watching this will be like, ‘Oh, EMF is the cause of everything.’ That’s not what I’m saying at all. But it definitely weakens our immune systems. Martin Pall’s research shows one mechanism for how that happens and … we know how electric the body is.

I mean, the heart communicates with the brain through an electromagnetic pulse, that’s been proven with the HeartMath studies … You can [find] fascinating articles on there about how we physiologically depend on different voltage changes in order for our body to function optimally.

Just to think that there are people out there that believe this environment we’ve created does not affect us — it’s insane when you start to read some of these studies about how our body uses voltage to heal and to function.”

How to Protect Yourself Now

I’ve published a series of suggestions on how to minimize your risk of COVID-19, including the use of sauna, nebulized hydrogen peroxide, vitamin C, ozone, melatonin and other nutraceuticals.

My favorite supplement of all, which I believe is particularly useful at this time, is molecular hydrogen tablets. The tablets are made of metallic magnesium, which when placed in water dissociates into magnesium ions, not a salt like magnesium oxide or magnesium threonate.

It’s just simple pure magnesium, which doesn’t have a laxative effect, and molecular hydrogen gas — both of which are extraordinarily useful for mitigating the negative effects and impacts of EMF.

I think almost everyone would benefit from them. The beautiful thing about molecular hydrogen is that it’s a selective antioxidant. Unlike most traditional antioxidants that indiscriminately reduce most free radicals, molecular hydrogen merely helps activate endogenous antioxidants to reduce the damage from the NRLP3 inflammasome activation.

The magnesium, meanwhile, acts as a calcium channel blocker, which helps mitigate the damage from the EMF exposure. So, it helps in many different ways. I think it’s one of the best strategies during this epidemic.

I recommend taking two tablets in water once a day (twice if you have heavy exposure either to COVID-19 or EMFs). Ideally, you want to pulse your intake, as consuming it regularly doesn’t seem to work as well. You need to pulse it to get the benefit because there needs to be a change in the concentration in your system.

As for lowering your EMF exposure, you can download a free chapter from my book, “EMF*D” that summarizes most of the major recommendations. I also review the most important considerations in “The No. 1 Thing to Do to Protect Yourself From EMFs.”

Hoyer is also working on videos demonstrating how to use shielded paint and other remediation strategies, so keep an eye out for those on his website, ShieldedHealing.com.

“Many are at home right now. You have time to do this. Our company stocked up on shielding paint before [the COVID-19 pandemic] so we don’t have to import it anymore. It would be a good time to take on a [remediation] project. Beyond that, things you can do right now is get off your cellphone. Your cellphone is a walking cellphone tower. I always have mine on airplane mode …”

Be Mindful of Symptoms of EMF Sensitivity

The most important area to shield is your bedroom, as that is where you spend your nights — the time when your body is going through its most valuable regeneration and healing processes. Sleeping in an EMF-free environment can go a long way toward avoiding electrosensitivity, which by the way tends to come on very rapidly, in many cases seemingly “overnight.”

Common symptoms of electromagnetic hypersensitivity include ringing in the ears, a feeling of burning or prickling in the skin, headache, heart palpitations and inexplicable anxiety, for example. Once you’re electrosensitive, additional and more extensive remediation strategies may become necessary.

Again, it may not be 5G per se that breaks down the immune system, but rather that the total EMF burden simply exceeds the tolerable threshold of many individuals.

“It involves a lot of detox of different heavy metals [and chemicals],” Hoyer explains.”There’s a chemical load, there’s heavy metal load. There’s all types of stressors that we need to reduce to make a person less electrosensitive. We’re getting more and more sensitive as a species and eventually we’ll hit a tipping point — perhaps once you add a virus that we’ve never had exposure to before …

You have to wonder, is this the tipping point? Not necessarily 5G? Is this virus and even 4G the tipping point? I wonder about that. I know 5G is adding more saturation of these frequencies, but we really need to get to a point where we understand that, at least in the bedroom, we need to be shielded. If you’re still reacting to things, you have to do more work.”

On 5G Frequencies

As explained by Hoyer, EMF shielding materials are capable of blocking about 99% of the harmful frequencies we’re exposed to, but not the lower frequencies associated with the Schumann resonance, which are associated with healing. He also points out that:

“A lot of people equate 5G with millimeter waves (MMW). That’s absolutely not the case in my opinion. I’ve tested … frequencies all the way up to 23.5 gigahertz (GHz) with 3G and 4G as back haul transmitters. Satellite TV is 12 to 18 GH.

The 5G frequencies they’re going to be using, or are using in some areas, are point-to-point communication right now … it’s laser pointed. I had a meter that measured MMWs and I took it to Los Angeles and Austin, Texas.

I didn’t detect anything in Austin where 5G was live. In Los Angeles, there were some neighborhoods where I barely detected something, but I had to point my receiver directly at the antenna to get it. If I was even a centimeter off, I would not detect it.

So [5G antennas] are like laser pointed frequencies from what I can tell with the testing that I did. And most of the 5G frequencies we’re being exposed to are going to be below 6 GHz. That’s what’s going to be communicating with our devices if you choose to get a 5G device, which I would recommend not to do …

We have much more saturation, like in Houston, there’s 3.5 GHz on every telephone pole. That’s a higher frequency than 2.4 so it’s faster. Five GHz on your router is faster. Some people report more symptoms from 5 GHz router versus 2.4 GHz and vice versa. It seems to be frequency dependent.

What’s interesting is the lower the frequency, down to 50 or 60 megahertz (MHz), the more it resonates with the human body. The size of the human body you’re getting in around 60 to 80 MHz range is about 6 foot. That’s what your body will resonate with.

On any meter where I measure this, I measure it with a real-time spectrum analyzer. You can actually see the rise and you’re using your body as an antenna much more from about 60 MHz all the way up to around 900 MHz, sometimes in up to 1500 MHz you can still see this antenna effect on the body.

But the higher frequencies don’t resonate as much with the conductance of the skin. So, your skin does provide a slight Faraday cage against the higher frequencies, but these lower frequencies definitely penetrate, including T-Mobile’s 600 MHz 5G frequency, which goes further and can penetrate deeper into tissue and through forests and everything.”

What Will 42,000 Satellites Do to the Earth?

SpaceX, which currently has about 400 low-Earth orbiting satellites, has obtained permission to put 42,000 satellites into orbit in order to provide the whole world with 5G coverage. The exact ramifications of this saturation remain to be seen, but I’m not particularly optimistic. Hoyer comments:

“SpaceX has about 400 satellites up. That was the number Elon Musk wanted to start … testing the network. That could turn on at any time. So those of us out there who are electrosensitive are paying attention and reading the news on that.

Amazon … Facebook [and] companies in the U.K. and Canada also have petitions to put up satellites, so it’s not just SpaceX … But SpaceX is looking at doing 42,000 satellites. They just got approved by the government for 1 million antennas on the ground, to work with the satellites. That is what I’m much more concerned about than the stuff beaming down from above, because they’re closer …

I think a lot of people are very concerned. I almost see this apocalyptic look on people’s faces when we talk about the Starlink and the satellites … like we’re not going to be protected at all. It’s just going to be everywhere.

Well, I think that’s true, but even the satellite dishes that we have for television and cable, you have to have a dish that collects that signal and concentrates it up. So, they’re actually pretty weak signals coming from above. It’s not like they’re completely blasting you with a laser beam down.

But like I was saying, the 1 million antennas on the ground, that’s what I’m much more concerned about. And then the devices that we and our neighbors have, those are very concerning. If you have a metal roof, that’s going to protect you somewhat from a lot of the different frequencies that are beaming down … I’m much more concerned about the stuff that’s way closer to us.”

Compassion for Each Other Is Paramount

As noted by Hoyer, we need to have more compassion in general for those who are immune compromised. Clearly, they need to be protected from SARS-CoV-2. But they also need to be protected from wireless frequencies and EMF exposure, and few give this a single thought.

“Many of these older people grew up in an environment where they didn’t have nearly as much EMF exposure. There’s still some of these older people who grew up in places that didn’t even have electricity.

So, just thinking about the irony of that whole thing gives me this sense of wanting to have more compassion for our fellow man, and also the tragedy of the social distancing that we have as well. I would love to have a solution to remedy that, but I’m just going to keep trucking on and doing what I do best and help people.”

Editor, Health Impact News

There has been a debate going on in healthcare for more than 100 years. It started in the 1800s when two competing points of view were put forward to explain disease, and the cause of disease.

French medical scientist Louis Pasteur wrote on the “germ theory” of disease, while his French contemporary, Antoine Béchamp promoted a theory of “terrain,” or sometimes referred to as the “cellular theory.”

The following chart highlights some of the differences between the two theories:

An objective, critical review of each theory can find some merit to each approach.

For example, Pasteur’s work on unseen germs led to a change in practice for surgeons of the day, and many credit the work of Scottish doctor Joseph Lister for starting the practice of requiring surgeons to wash and disinfect their hands prior to surgery. Hospital-induced infections such as sepsis dropped so dramatically, that the practice of sterilization spread to surgical equipment as well.

But as an overall model for disease and health, many feel that Pasteur’s germ theory of disease overstates things in a reductionist sort of way that misses much in disease treatment. Holistic doctors today who supplement their medical training based mostly on the germ theory of disease, tend to follow the work originally put forth by Béchamp that the “terrian,” more commonly referred to today as the body’s “immune system,” is much more important and effective in treating or curing disease.

The evidence to support this theory is that pathogens affect everyone differently, not the same. Even during some of the most deadly recorded “plagues” or “pandemics” in history, some people succumbed, while others did not. Usually those who survived far outnumber those who died, leading to the theory that the immune system is the key factor in not only fighting disease, but preventing it in the first place.

Of course today’s medical system is NOT focused on prevention by building up the body’s immune system, as there is no profit from that. Today’s multi-TRILLION dollar medical industry needs sick patients to treat to remain economically viable. Well patients don’t provide the same profit. See:

But just as Dr. Joseph Lister put into practice Pastuer’s theory of germs with great success in reducing hospital deaths, which might be great for preventing the deaths of patients already sick and is more of a “hygiene” protocol than a health protocol, so too many physicians today are putting into practice methods that more closely follow Béchamp’s theories by bolstering the body’s immune system with great success in treating disease.

One such doctor that we have featured many times here on Health Impact News, is Dr. David Brownstein from the Center For Holistic Medicine in Michigan.

Dr. Brownstein has just published a report where he is claiming that his clinic has treated 85 patients for COVID-19 and that none of them have died, and none of them had to be hospitalized. He has also video recorded some of their testimonies.

So what treatment protocols did Dr. Brownstein use for this kind of success rate?

85 COVID Patients at The Center for Holistic Medicine: Zero Hospitalizations and No Deaths

by Dr. Brownstein

At my office, the Center for Holistic Medicine (CHM), we have had 85 COVID patients. At this time, no one has been hospitalized, no one has been diagnosed with pneumonia, and there have been no deaths.

There are five practitioners at CHM: Drs. Brownstein, Ng, Nusbaum, Jenny Drummond, PA, and Taylor Easson, NP. Since the start of the COVID-19 crisis, I have been asking my partners how their COVID patients are doing.

As of this week, we have had 85 patients either diagnosed with COVID or suspected COVID. I am pleased to report that our patients are doing well with this illness. (Note, since new guidelines have come out stating that any suspected COVID patient can be diagnosed with COVID, I am lumping COVID and suspected COIVD patients together for this post.)

I first reported to you about COVID on January 26, 2020. That was the first time I presented our protocol of using vitamins A, C, D, and iodine not only to support the immune system but also to treat viral infections.

In that post, I also pointed out how important eating a healthy diet is. The importance of using intravenous nutrient therapy, especially vitamin C, was mentioned.

Finally, I suggested that, with coronavirus, it would be wise not to get a flu vaccine since the flu vaccine has been shown to significantly increase the risk of coronavirus and other flu-like viral infections.

That post seems like a lifetime ago even though it was only 10 weeks ago. During that time period, my message has not changed. In fact, after witnessing the results our patients have experienced, I am more convinced than ever that a holistic approach like I presented above should be the first-line treatment provided to any COVID patient.

The human body is a true wonder. Given the proper support, it can do wonders. And, when the body is healthy, it can withstand and overcome an infectious illness like COVID.

The initial conventional approach to COVID was to encourage people to wash their hands (a good thing). As things worsened, the only other conventional idea was to quarantine. When the disease spun out of control our Government and conventional medicine panicked. They had no real therapies to help COVID-suffering patients except for supportive care.

Thankfully, a few conventional therapies, like hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, have been promoted—though many in conventional medicine were downplaying it for far too long.

At my office, we were ready . The first 24 years of practicing holistic medicine was our time to figure out what worked and what did not work for people suffering from viral infections. That set us up to be ready for this pandemic.

In my blogs, I encouraged people to take high doses of vitamins A, C, D, and iodine at the first sign of an illness. In our practice, this was sufficient for the majority of our COVID patients. I (and my partners) have no doubt that the vast majority of COVID patients would avoid a deterioration of their symptoms if they started this protocol at the onset of symptoms.

However, some became more ill or did not start the oral supplements early enough into their illness. Those patients needed additional holistic therapies. These included nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine along with intravenous nutrient therapies.

To protect our staff and healthy patients, we did not treat sick COVID patients inside my office. We were gowning up and meeting our patients at their automobile at the back of our building and administering IVs and ozone therapies. Some of these patients were very sick. So far, they all recovered. I have shared some of their stories via a skype interview on previous blog posts.

To watch a few of our patient testimonials go to:

There Is Still Hope Out There (3/28/20): Christopher

There Is Still Hope Out There (3/30/20): Jeremiah

There Is Still Hope Out There (4/05/20): Kendra

I think the end is in sight. We seem to be crossing over the hump of this dreadful disease. I have no doubt we will be in a much better position over the coming two weeks.

Folks, I hope the Powers-That-Be learn from this catastrophe. In the future, we need to focus on supporting the host rather than conventional medicine’s focus on killing the infectious organism. We do not have a vaccine or any other conventional therapy that is successful at destroying COVID.

In the future, I can guarantee you there will be other infectious illnesses that conventional medicine has no treatment to offer. Instead of waiting for the hail-Mary from conventional medicine, it is better to be prepared and have your body ready to fight back. This can be achieved by following my original instructions; eat a healthy diet, maintain optimal hydration, exercise, and correct nutrient imbalances with vitamin and mineral supplementation.

If you don’t have a holistic doctor, it is past time to find one. At my office, we are happy to see you or do a telemed appointment. If you are interested in this please email Ann Salomon at info@centerforholisticmedicine.com.

A holistic doctor can help you achieve your optimal health. Conventional doctors, on the other hand, are busy diagnosing pathology and prescribing the drug to treat that diagnosis. The problem with the conventional model is that the drug prescribed does not promote health as nearly all drugs poison enzymes and block receptors in the body.

There is a time and a place for drug therapies, but they are well over-prescribed in the US. The use of many drug therapies leaves the body depleted of vital nutrients that it will need when confronted with something like COVID.

As I previously stated, the Center for Holistic Medicine currently has 85 COVID patients who are all doing well and have not been hospitalized. There were some I was worried about—they kept me up at night. I called them daily to monitor their progress.

Having them increase the frequency of nebulizing hydrogen peroxide and iodine helped them all. Some of the sickest were advised to nebulize every hour or two for a short period. IV therapies and ozone treatments have helped many.

This therapy has worked for helping COVID patients. It is sad that hospitalized COVID patients are not given the proper nutritional support when they are admitted.

In a perfect world, I would immediately start an IV of vitamin C and begin nebulizing any hospitalized COVID patient with hydrogen peroxide and iodine. I am sure that would markedly lower the need for mechanical ventilation.

Final Thoughts:

Like most holistic therapies, the earlier they are started in a disease process the better they perform. AT THE FIRST SIGN OF A VIRAL ILLNESS I ENCOURAGE MY PATIENTS TO START MY VIRAL PROTOCOL OF TAKING VITAMINS A, C, D AND IODINE. Due to the severity of COVID, I now recommend starting to nebulize hydrogen peroxide and iodine early into the illness as well.

Better times are coming. Keep me updated on how you are doing. I will much more to talk about in relation to COVID. More posts will be coming soon.

To All Our Health,

Last week (April, 2020), we published a report on the state of America’s hospital system in the midst of the Coronavirus outbreak, and I wrote then:

The so-called Coronavirus pandemic “crisis” is very quickly taking a back seat to more serious crises in the U.S. right now, and perhaps none more critical than the closure of hospitals and emergency rooms, along with doctors and nurses being laid off, which is happening all across the country.

See:

The other crisis facing the U.S. right now that may soon dwarf the Coronavirus “crisis” is the nation’s looming meat shortage.

The nation now faces meat shortages, America’s primary source of protein, as processing plants across the country have shut down or reduced operations. 80% of the U.S. meat processing plants are owned by only 4 companies. Some grocery stores have already begun to limit meat purchases in advance of the expected shortages.

At recent White House Coronavirus Task Force Press briefings, the nation has heard President Trump boast about how he had brokered a trade deal with China back in January of 2020, that includes China buying $12.5 billion of American agricultural products. Trump has been highlighting this as a great deal for American farmers.

So which agricultural products did China choose to increase in purchase and export to China after Trump negotiated the trade deal between the two countries back in January?

Pork seems to be at the head of the list.

China has had major pork supply problems since last year (2019), due to an outbreak of “African swine fever.” Some estimates claim that about two-thirds of China’s swine herd has been lost to the disease. (Source.)

So being forced by President Trump into purchasing agricultural products as part of his trade deal, it is no surprise that pork is at the top of the list of exports China wanted.

U.S. livestock reports for last week (last week of April, 2020) show a five-week high in U.S. pork exports to China.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture reported export sales of U.S. pork in the week ended April 23 at 50,300 tonnes, a three-week high. China was the top buyer, booking 35,138 tonnes, while actual pork shipments to China totaled 20,683 tonnes, the most in five weeks. (Source.)

As U.S. pork sales soar due to the growing export market to China, U.S. customers are having an increasingly difficult time finding pork in their grocery stores, which may soon be bare of any pork products at all.

One has to wonder who got the better end of this trade deal with China?

The largest producer of pork in the world is Smithfield Foods, located in Smithfield, Virginia. According to their company website, some of the national brands they own include:

Smithfield®, Eckrich®, Nathan’s Famous®, Farmland®, Armour®, Farmer John®, Kretschmar®, John Morrell®, Cook’s®, Gwaltney®, Carando®, Margherita®, Curly’s®, Healthy Ones®, Morliny®, Krakus®, and Berlinki®. (Source.)

Smithfield Foods was bought by the Chinese company Shuanghui International Holdings Limited in 2013.

According to a recent report at CNBC, Trump is aware of this problem, but is hesitant to restrict exports to China right now.

President Donald Trump’s executive order this week requiring American meatpacking plants to stay open during the coronavirus pandemic is raising new questions about massive U.S. meat exports, particularly the export of pork to China. The order has highlighted a debate inside the White House over whether to limit exports of pork to China, and what the president decides could have major implications for other U.S. exports. On Wednesday, Trump held a private call with major meat industry CEOs, where he was asked about the prospect of export limits on meat, given that an imminent shortage for U.S. consumers was the justification for the executive order. The president responded that he is not interested in restricting exports at this time, according to current and former White House officials who requested anonymity to describe a private call. Still, there are some in the White House who are pushing for tighter export restrictions on meat, a former administration official told CNBC. (Source.)

The U.S. Agricultural Industry is not Sustainable or Secure – This is What Happens when a National Crisis Happens

The first 5 presidents of the United States were all farmers (the 6th president was the son of a farmer who was also the 2nd president) at a time when 90% of the population in the United States was involved in agriculture.

By the time Abraham Lincoln served as president of the United States in 1862, about 48 percent of the people living in the U.S. were farmers.

Today, that figure is less than 1%.

There has probably not been another period of history where so few people control a nation’s food supply as what we see today in the United States, where less than 1% are responsible for feeding over 325 million people in the United States, and millions around the world as well.

Who are these people that make up less than 1% of our population?

They are mostly people who run multi-national corporations. Oxfam America lists 10 main corporations that control most of the food in the U.S. and around the world as can be seen in this infographic:

I have been writing on the dangerous problems with America’s fragile food system for almost 20 years now, as have others.

In 2008, American filmmaker Robert Kenner produced a documentary on America’s food system called “Food, Inc.” It received great reviews, but really did not take off until 2010, when members of the film appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show, where a discounted copy of the film was promoted and sold through Amazon.com.

One of the more revealing portions of the film was regarding commercial chicken production in the U.S. Contract farmers with the big poultry producers like Tyson and Purdue were too afraid to go on camera and expose what the industry was doing, by basically indenturing poultry farmers to a lifestyle said to be similar to slavery.

One poultry farmer who may have already been on her way out of the industry did appear on camera. Her testimony can be found on YouTube. She was the only one brave enough to become a whistleblower.

The US Poultry and Egg Association has produced a video of their own version of their industry, probably produced as a rebuttal to the bad press the industry has received over the years, particularly since Food, Inc. was produced. Here is their side:

With meat shortages in America potentially affecting millions of Americans for the first time in modern history, it might be time for the American consumer to learn a bit more about how the food they have been purchasing and eating these past years has arrived on their table.

Civil Eats published an Op-Ed last week titled:

Contract farmers don’t own the animals they’re raising, so they can’t sell them to another market. And the animals themselves haven’t been bred to stay alive.

By Tyler Whitley

Some excerpts:

For decades, farmers and their advocates have warned us of the inherent weaknesses in our food system. Now, in the midst of the COVID-19 outbreak, those weaknesses are laid bare: Big Ag has built a food system house of cards that is collapsing on the farmers who feed us.

Rather than acknowledge the need for reform, and in an effort to shift blame, Tyson Foods recently took out full-page ads in several major newspapers claiming that “the food supply chain is breaking” because of plant closures. But as the architects of this devastation, Tyson Foods has profited in the billions for the last three years in a row, while spending millions on federal lobbying to maintain the status quo of a fragile food system that values corporate profits over people, land, and animals.

In the last two weeks, slaughter and meat processing plants have been shuttered across the country as hundreds of workers have fallen ill. Thirteen plants employing tens of thousands of workers have now closed, creating a predictable bottleneck. Restaurants and institutional cafeterias have closed, leaving contracts hanging, and driving up demand for products in supermarkets instead. As the supply chain reels from this massive disruption, farmers who raise chickens, hogs, and cows are left facing a costly crisis that could mean bankruptcy for many: They have nowhere to send the animals they’ve raised for companies like Tyson.

Last Friday, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced plans to have its Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) work with farmers to either find new markets, or euthanize and dispose of animals stranded in the supply chain. This plan offers too little, too late to farming families that depend on the companies to fill their barn. The USDA fails to address the fact that farmers under contract don’t own the animals they are raising, and therefore cannot simply find a new market for them. Having failed repeatedly for over a decade to establish basic protections for farmers in contracts with the big meat packers, the USDA is clearly sidestepping responsibility and avoiding the problem.

Depopulation of pigs, cows, and chickens could mean the death of millions of otherwise healthy animals. To date, nearly 2 million animals have been culled. One estimate out of Iowa warns that farmers may be asked to euthanize 700,000 pigs a week due to the processing plant bottleneck.

This is not an unpredictable consequence; the supply chain was designed this way. The advent of the Confined Animal Feeding Operation (or CAFO) in the 70s and 80s led to a technological revolution in agriculture. Taking animals off of pasture and keeping tens of thousands in dark, closed barns seems counter-intuitive because of the added costs of feed and increased health problems. But public policies were established to subsidize cheap grain for animal feed, enable the heavy use of antibiotics, and funnel taxpayer dollars in an attempt to clean up the mess.

This has allowed big meat companies to reap profits without paying the full cost of doing business. As a result, farms raising animals on pasture and operating more sustainably was only possible for those farmers who had access to higher-end (mostly urban and suburban) markets.

The CAFO boom directly contributed to exponential corporate concentration in the meat sector. For the last 40 years, a handful of very large companies including Tyson, Smithfield, and Perdue have built the system we have today, buying up smaller family businesses and destroyed regional food systems in their wake.

As their vertical supply chains grew, independent auctions and processors went out of business. Farmers raising chickens and pigs independently had fewer places to sell or process their animals. Soon, the only way for most farmers to stay viable raising poultry or livestock was to get a contract with a big company. Today, contract farming is the norm for meat production. Ninety percent of the 9 billion chickens raised each year in this country are grown under contract. Fifty-seven percent of hogs are owned and slaughtered by just four companies.

Big multinational companies dominate the market for almost all the meat we eat in the United States. Companies like Tyson own every step in the supply chain, from the hatchery to the feed mill to the processing plant. The only thing the big companies don’t own are the farms themselves.

Earlier this month (April, 2020) we reported about the shortages of meats at supermarkets, and how this reflected not a shortage of meat in the U.S., but the failures of our supply chains when a nationwide crisis hits, such as the Coronavirus scare has done.

We discussed how allowing local communities to directly access meat from farmers and ranchers in their own counties and states was the solution to food security issues in our nation’s meat supplies.

See:

The publication Civil Eats has done an excellent job of reporting on these kinds of problems that are systemic within our nation’s food supply chains.

In another excellent investigative report on flour shortages that many are starting to see around the country, Amy Halloran has written an excellent article titled:

Again, as we saw with the meat market, there is currently no shortage of flour in our nation. The issue is the frail supply chain.

Some excerpts from Halloran’s excellent article:

There is no flour shortage in America. Outside the taut supply chains of industrialized food, small flour mills are working double-time to fill fresh flour orders for dedicated fans and a new crowd of bakers. And while these local millers have been around for generations, it took a pandemic to reveal them as alternatives to the dominant grain system. Today, having a relationship with nearby grain farmers seems like a more secure route to bread than it was just a month ago. Industrial milling and factory baking set the standards for what gets grown, and the global marketplace sets the price. Farmers are servants to massive debts they’ve had to take on to purchase equipment, and each year they borrow more money just to pay for inputs, labor, and other expenses. Outside of this industrial baking complex, there exists a world of farmer-cultivated grain systems that not only address the limited choices farmers face inside the conventional system, but also produce delicious, fresh flour, which is generally stoneground and full of the fat and flavor that industrial processing strips away. And it is as different from its supermarket cousin as a tree-ripened peach is from a can of cling peaches. People who are just awakening to the promise of regional grains will be surprised to see just how many exist, how well-rooted they are—and how they’re ready to supply you with grains that will change your life. There are many community grains, produced, processed, and distributed within local and regional value chains that remain intact despite the pandemic. By adapting food systems to a regional scale, farmer-leaders…. are taking risks to better support and care for the land they steward from the ground to the bank. They’re giving consumers an opportunity to buy staple crops that invest in soil health, water quality, and carbon sequestration while offering skilled jobs that employ local folks—on the farm, at the mill, and in craft bakeries.

When Restaurants Become Grocery Stores

In yet another excellent article published by Civil Eats, Jodi Helmer wrote a report titled:

In our article about Wyoming’s Food Freedom Act and the nation’s meat supply issues, we mentioned how the closing of restaurants and other venues that serve food, such as sporting and entertainment events, was what was putting a strain on the meat market supplies.

With the entire nation confined to their homes and unable to visit restaurants and other venues where food is served, this in turn created a huge demand for more food at grocery stores, while bulk food distributors were left with an excess of inventory that was not packaged properly for retail sales.

Helmer’s article documents how some restaurants have dealt with this situation while solving two problems at once: providing more business for their restaurant so they could stay in business, and providing much needed items to their consumers that they could not find in their local grocery stores, such as eggs, flour, and toilet paper.

Some excerpts from Helmer’s excellent article:

A few short weeks ago, Sarah Heard was cooking dishes like charred duroc pork, veal sweetbreads, and butternut risotto and serving them in the Austin, Texas, restaurant Foreign & Domestic. Now, the dining room is closed, and instead of serving nose-to-tail suppers, chef/owner Heard is filling bags with groceries. In the last two weeks, she has stocked (and sold out of) staples such as eggs, salt, and lemons; customers purchased 100 pounds of flour in a single afternoon. The coronavirus pandemic has led Foreign & Domestic to evolve from a full-service restaurant into a grocery store. “We knew that people were having trouble finding things at the stores,” Heard recalls. “We thought it could help the neighborhood—and it’s possibly the only reason we’re staying afloat.” The pandemic dealt a significant blow to restaurants. The latest data from the U.S. Department of Labor shows that the U.S. lost a total of 701,000 jobs in March; restaurants and bars accounted for 60 percent of those losses. The devastation had forced restaurants to get creative to keep their doors open. In addition to offering takeout and deliveries, steakhouses are being reinvented as butcher shops, upscale eateries are hosting virtual cocktail classes, and chefs are creating DIY meal kits. Turning dining rooms into supermarkets is also proving popular. Read the full article here.

How Do We Change the Nation’s Food Supply Chains?

Food security is a serious issue in this country, and the Coronavirus scare should be a wake-up call for everyone. As far as the food shortages in our grocery stores, this might get worse before it gets better.

And remember, this is all simply the result of people staying home. Imagine how much worse this could be if there were disruptions to our energy sector, and our truckers who transport all this food all across the nation could not get diesel fuel to power their trucks?

Or a disruption to our electrical grid where all of stored refrigerated and frozen foods would quickly spoil? Or even worse scenarios where communication systems went down, such as cell phones and the Internet, and without the ability to communicate to the public things would quickly spin out of control into rioting and looting.

What is the answer to the food security issue?

Those who have followed our reporting on this issue for the past decade or so will know that my position is that government is NOT the solution, but the problem.

Government food policies are what have created the fragile system we have created, with their cheap subsidized commodity food systems along with their fragile supply chains that are so easily disrupted.

No, the answer to food security lies in YOU, the American consumer. Small businesses all across the country, like many of those featured in the articles reported by Civil Eats, are happy to step in and fill in the gaps. They don’t need, and I am sure most do not want, government subsidies to fuel their businesses.

They need you, the American consumer, to start changing their buying habits, and start supporting local businesses.

We need a return to the “old fashion” way of conducting business, where there is a town butcher, a town baker, local grain mills, and local dairy farms and other kinds of farms producing and selling meats, produce, dairy, and other food staples to the consumer directly through local businesses.

Those in the metropolitan areas need to find like-minded neighbors and fellow city residents to band together and form co-ops and buying clubs to support farmers that may be located further out in the rural areas, to more efficiently bring that food from the farm to the tables of those in the cities.

When this country was founded in the 1700s, 90% of the population was involved in agriculture. When the Civil War started under President Lincoln, it was about 50% of the population in agriculture feeding the other 50%.

Today it is less than 1% of the population feeding the other 99%, and just a handful of companies controlling the nation’s food supply.

There is only one way we are going to see more food security in our nation, and it begins with the American consumer, and the consumer’s willingness to sacrifice “convenience” to have one-stop shopping centers that offer everything at cheaper prices (and almost always also cheaper quality food) due to government subsidies.

Will it happen? Will this be enough of a wake-up call to get even 10 percent of the nation’s population to change their buying habits? Because that is probably all it will take to turn the tide and start things rolling in the right direction.

But if everyone sits around and waits for the government to provide solutions, we can see what their history is. They will decide who to bail out and who not to bail out, and they will decide who wins and who loses. And we all know how that turns out.

If government truly wants to help bring food security to our nation’s food supply chains, then the best thing they can do is REMOVE barriers that prevent direct farm-to-consumer sales, such as the Wyoming Food Freedom Act that we highlighted earlier this month, and then get out of the way and let consumers and small businesses flourish in this nation once again.

As long as we still have a vestige of a free society left, the American consumer is still the most powerful force to change our food security problem in the U.S.",25,Low,,USA

Earlier this week (April, 2020), U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, Sonny Perdue, appeared at the White House Coronavirus Task Force press conference to explain why the country is facing some food shortages, such as meats, in grocery stores, even though there is plenty of food in the country.

The problem is the commodity-based food distribution system, which is experiencing bottle necks right now due to restaurants and other food establishments being shut down across the country due to the coronavirus restrictions.

A significant portion of commodity-based food sales is processed, packaged, and distributed for businesses, and not for consumers who purchase food in stores and supermarkets.

So with the decline in food sales to businesses, there has also been a corresponding demand for food in grocery stores from consumers who would normally be eating more at restaurants, schools, ball parks, and work places.

Lisa Held, writing for Civil Eats, highlighted the problem in an article published earlier this week:

“It’s like Armageddon, but we’ll get through it,” Benjamin Walker explained over the phone in mid-March. That day, sales at Baldor—the New York-based food distribution company where Walker is the vice president of sales and marketing—had dropped by 85 percent. With 90 percent of its business focused on food service, Baldor’s 400 trucks are typically loaded with specialty produce, meats, and baked goods bound for restaurants, hotels, schools, and stadiums in New York City, Boston, and Washington, D.C. In other words, its food goes to all of the institutions that have been shut down by the coronavirus pandemic. “The shimmer of hope for us is the 10 percent of retail [sales we were already doing],” Walker said. “That’s really the only food channel operating at the moment, and that supply chain has been maxed out.” Over the last months, Walker and his team have been acting quickly to onboard new accounts and reroute those trucks. As shoppers across the country have stockpiled food in anticipation of weeks or months of eating at home, there has been significant panic at the sight of empty shelves in grocery stores. Experts and food-industry groups have jumped in to assure the public, in various publications, that the American food supply was strong and those shelves do not reflect shortages. Instead, they were said to be a reflection of behind-the-scenes adjustments that need to be made by manufacturers, distributors, and retailers to keep up with where people are eating. (Full article here.)

There are a lot of businesses that get a piece of the pie that is our food system here in the U.S., controlling the flow of food from the farm to the consumer.

When everything is going well, it is like a high-speed train going from one destination to another. And most of the food you see in your grocery store, or eat at institutions, is heavily subsidized by taxpayers as well, keeping food cheap, and not representing the true cost to produce that food.

But when a crisis hits the nation, such as the current coronavirus pandemic, it just takes one section of the train to derail and cause the entire system to start failing, and potentially to completely derail.

And the effects we are seeing today as a result of the nationwide lock downs, are really a small problem in the grand scheme of things when it comes to food distribution in this country.

Just think of what the effects could potentially look like if, for example, transportation was disrupted due to energy disruptions, or communication was disrupted due to electrical grid issues, or telecommunication issues.

This is mild in comparison to what might happen, for example, if the country found itself in a real war, and not a “war” on a virus, where an enemy could bring down the power grid, disrupt the Internet, etc.

This should be a wake up call that our nation’s food distribution system is incredibly vulnerable.

The Food Freedom Movement

Back in 2011, some small communities in the state of Maine began what many today call the “Food Freedom” movement, where local municipalities passed “Food Sovereignty” laws, seeking to bypass State and Federal regulations to allow farmers to sell their products directly to consumers in their community, cutting out all the “middlemen” in the food distribution system within their local communities. See:

Such arrangements are win-win situations for consumers and farmers in their communities. Farmers are able to charge a higher price, usually for a better quality product as well, and it keeps costs down for the consumer by bypassing all the middlemen in the process.

The consumer still usually pays a higher price than the commodity products in grocery stores, because government subsidies are generally not available for such farm-to-consumer sales, but the consumer gets a far better quality product, and develops a relationship in their community with the producers of the food, where accountability is much more transparent, in contrast to commodity food purchased in most grocery stores where the consumer has no idea where the food came from, or even which country it may have come from.

As can be expected, there was strong push back from state and federal regulators, and these local laws in Maine went through many court battles.

But lawmakers realized that this was a popular concept with the citizens of their state, and so state-wide bills were proposed, and in 2017, the governor of Maine signed “the Maine Food Sovereignty Act.”

There are still many hurdles and challenges to open up direct farm to consumer sales in the U.S., but Wyoming has been recognized as one of the best examples today of a Food Freedom law, and if the commodity-based food system does fail, either in the short-term future, or in the future under a more severe national crisis, residents of Wyoming might be in the best position to still obtain food from producers in their state.

Baylen Linnekin, writing for Reason Magazine, recently highlighted the advantages of Wyoming’s Food Freedom Act, especially in light of potential meat shortages now facing the nation’s commodity food system.

Wyoming’s first-and-best-in-the-nation food freedom law just keeps getting better. Wyoming’s groundbreaking Food Freedom Act has served as a national model for how states can deregulate many in-state food sales. The five-year-old law opened up many previously illegal food transactions in Wyoming, and has delivered on its promise to benefit ranchers, other food entrepreneurs, and consumers alike. And it’s done so without a single case of foodborne illness being tied to any foods sold under the law. The law also keeps getting better. As I detailed a column just last month, an amendment to the Act will allow low-risk foods such as homemade jams to be sold in grocery stores and sold and consumed in restaurants. That was great news. But yet another new amendment to the law, passed last month and set to take effect in July, could further bolster the fortunes of ranchers and consumers in the state. A new animal share amendment will let consumers buy individual cuts of meat directly from ranchers though an animal-share agreement, completely outside of the typical U.S. Department of Agriculture inspection regime. That’s something that’s still illegal in the other 49 states. It’s also why the Wyoming law could be a game changer for ranchers in the state and—should other states follow suit—a valuable new revenue stream for farmers and ranchers across the country. The new amendment was introduced by Wyoming State Rep. Tyler Lindholm (R), who co-sponsored the bipartisan Food Freedom Act five years ago. “The idea for the bill is simple,” Lindholm—a rancher with whom I serve on the board of the nonprofit Farm-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund—told me this week. “Let ranchers and farmers sell herd shares for their animals. That way the entire herd is ‘owned’ by all of the customers before slaughter, thereby meeting the exemption standards of the federal law, and now the rancher does not have to jump through the hoops of the Federal Meat Inspection Act and can utilize the smaller mom and pop butchers that still [exist] in most of our small towns.” The premise behind animal shares isn’t new. For example, some states which prohibit raw (unpasteurized) milk sales allow distribution to people who’ve purchased shares in one or more of a farmer’s dairy cattle. These “herdshare” agreements let a farmer raise and care for the herd-shared livestock in exchange for providing some of its (typically unpasteurized) milk to share owners. Meat sharing has been a bit more complicated. As I detail in my book, Biting the Hands that Feed Us: How Fewer, Smarter Laws Would Make Our Food System More Sustainable, a consumer may buy a significant portion of a living cow—say one-quarter or one-half its post-slaughter weight—and take possession of its meat after it’s been slaughtered in a non-USDA approved facility without running afoul of USDA rules. But that can mean buying more than 100-200 pounds of beef. Until the new Wyoming law, consumers who weren’t quite that hungry (or who wanted only a particular cut of meat) have had little option but to buy from farmers who’d had their animals processed under the USDA’s rules or to go to the grocery store for similarly inspected cuts. The Wyoming amendment takes advantage of an exemption created under § 623(a) of the Federal Meat Inspection Act, which governs interstate and even most intrastate livestock slaughter and meat sales in this country. The FMIA exemption allows custom slaughtering of livestock by and for an “owner” of the animal. (Read the full article at Reason.com)

Time to Invest in Our Local Farmers: The Herd Share Economic Model

My company, Healthy Traditions, has been selling grass-fed meats and pastured poultry and eggs online for more than a decade. We source these products from small-scale family farms, many of them Amish farms in western Wisconsin.

But we have never considered ourselves as a replacement for consumers to purchase these kinds of products directly from producers in their own communities. Direct sales from farm to consumer is always the best option, if it is available.

For one thing, the consumer can find similar, high-quality products such as we sell, at a much more affordable price than purchasing it from our online ecommerce business, by cutting out the middlemen, in this case us. We have to pay the farmers a fair price for their products, the products have to be stored in freezers, shipped with special packaging and dry ice, etc. – all middleman services that increase the price.

In addition to these additional costs, our meats have to be processed in USDA certified processing plants to meet federal laws to sell food between states. There have been some seasons where we have had little to no chickens for sale, for example, because small-scale poultry processing plants that meet the standards for USDA inspectors are very few, and many go out of business after only a few years of trying to make it.

And because these products are not subsidized, typically only the upper middle class and wealthier consumers can afford them.

And with the current lock downs, more people are purchasing online, putting strains on our inventory as well.

The “herd share” or “animal share” model defined by Baylen Linnekin above, is a far better economic model, if we want to be serious about food security in this country. This model has served well in many parts of the country, because the farmer is not selling retail, and is not participating in the commodity food distribution system at all.

By allowing their neighbors and fellow state citizens to invest in their farm, by purchasing shares in their operation which gives them ownership of part of their livestock, they are producing a legal, contractual relationship with members of their community, which should bypass the many regulations that are designed only for the commodity food distribution model.

Courts around the country have a mixed-bag record of upholding these contractual rights, so maybe it is time to pass federal laws protecting such contracts?

Do you have a herd share operation? Are you a farmer who is interested in starting a herd share operation for members of your community and state?

If so, you can contact us at HealthyTraditions.com. Put “Herdshare” in the subject of your email, and if there is enough interest, we will create a directory of herdshare programs around the U.S. so consumers have choices once the commodity-based food system fails.

The current U.S. food distribution system might survive the coronavirus crisis, but it would not take much to bring it to a screeching halt, sadly.

Excerpts:

Coconut oil, whose health benefits have been proven in the past, will be tested for use as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus infection.

“That [VCO] is being looked into,” Health Secretary Francisco Duque III told CNN Philippines’ Newsroom on Tuesday.

“We have heard very good studies with regard to its ability to neutralize the viruses, but for the COVID- 19, it is not clear,” the top health official added.

He made the reaction following Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles’ announcement Monday that a former academician from one of the country’s top universities proposed to test coconut oil as COVID-19 treatment amid the absence of a specific treatment.

In a research proposal published on January 31, Ateneo de Manila University Professor Emeritus Fabian Antonio Dayrit and Dr. Mary Newport of Spring Hill Neonatolody in Florida, United States proposed to conduct a clinical study on patients infected with the COVID-19 involving VCO, saying “this treatment is affordable and virtually risk-free, and the potential benefits are enormous.” Nograles said the National University of Singapore has agreed to test VCO as a prophylactic against the COVID-19.

Current evidence suggests coconut oil and its derivatives are safe and effective antiviral compounds in both humans and animals, the researchers noted.

“Several in vitro, animal, and human studies support the potential of coconut oil, lauric acid and its derivatives as effective and safe agents against a virus like nCoV-2019 [COVID-19],” they said.

People living in the Philippines, a country of islands not very far off the coast of China, remember all too well the last time a deadly coronavirus epidemic broke out in China.

It was 2003 when the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus broke out in China. It infected over 7000 people in China with over 600 recorded deaths.

Even with its close proximity to China and large Chinese population in the Philippine nation of about 80 million people, only 14 cases of SARS was reported with two recorded deaths.

Canada, many thousands of miles away, had far more cases and more deaths recorded due to SARS infection from China than neighboring Philippine Islands.

One of the theories put forward at the time as to why the Filipino people had so few cases, was the country’s predominant use of cooking oil: Coconut Oil.

The Philippines is the world’s largest producer of coconut oil, with about 70% of the world’s coconut oil being exported from the country.

The medium chain fatty acids of coconut oil, and primarily lauric acid, have been known to destroy enveloped viruses by researchers for many years.

Dr. Fabian Dayrit, Ph.D. and Dr. Mary Newport, M.D. have just published a paper regarding coconut oil’s potential to also combat the new coronavirus currently infecting people in China.

The Potential of Coconut Oil and its Derivatives as Effective and Safe Antiviral Agents Against the Novel Coronavirus (nCoV-2019)

by Fabian M. Dayrit, Ph.D. and Mary T. Newport, M.D.

Anteneo De Manila University

Read the research of Professor Emeritus Dr. Fabian Antonio Dayrit (GS’67, HS’71, BS Chemistry ’75) and Dr. Mary Newport of Spring Hill Neonatolody, Inc. on the potential use of coconut oil as a safe antiviral agent against the novel coronavirus.

As we write this, the World Health Organization has declared a global emergency over the novel coronavirus, nCoV-2019, that has spread beyond China. There is still no cure for nCoV-2019. nCoV-2019 has been shown to be related to SARS (Zhou et al., 2020), a coronavirus which caused an outbreak in 2003. Several researchers have been designing drugs to specifically target protease enzymes in coronavirus, but testing for these drugs is many months away. What if there is a treatment candidate against the coronavirus that might already be available and whose safety is already established? Lauric acid (C12) and monolaurin, its derivative, have been known for many years to have significant antiviral activity. Lauric acid is a medium-chain fatty acid which makes up about 50% of coconut oil; monolaurin is a metabolite that is naturally produced by the body’s own enzymes upon ingestion of coconut oil and is also available in pure form as a supplement. Sodium lauryl sulfate, a common surfactant that is made from lauric acid, has been shown to have potent antiviral properties. Lauric acid, monolaurin, and sodium lauryl sulfate (which is also known as sodium dodecyl sulfate) are used in a wide range of products for their antiviral properties. Mechanisms of action Three mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antiviral activity of lauric acid and monolaurin: first, they cause disintegration of the virus envelope; second, they can inhibit late maturation stage in the virus replicative cycle; and third, they can prevent the binding of viral proteins to the host cell membrane. Disintegration of the virus membrane . The antiviral activities of lauric acid and monolaurin were first noted by Sands and co-workers (1979) and later by Hierholzer & Kabara (1982). In particular, Hierholzer & Kabara showed that monolaurin was able to reduce infectivity of 14 human RNA and DNA enveloped viruses in cell culture by >99.9%, and that monolaurin acted by disintegrating the virus envelope. Thormar and co-workers (1987) confirmed the ability of lauric acid and monolaurin to inactivate viruses by disintegration of the cell membrane. Sodium lauryl sulfate has been shown to be able to solubilize and denature the viral envelope (Piret 2000, 2002). Inhibits virus maturation . The Junin virus (JUNV) is the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever. In a comparison among the saturated fatty acids from C10 to C18 against JUNV infection, Bartolotta and co-workers (2001) showed that lauric acid was the most active inhibitor. From mechanistic studies, it was concluded that lauric acid inhibited a late maturation stage in the replicative cycle of JUNV. From transmission electron microscope images, JUNV is an enveloped virus featuring glycoproteins that are embedded in the lipid bilayer forming viral spikes (Grant et al., 2012); this is similar to nCoV-2019. Prevents binding of viral proteins to the host cell membrane . Hornung and co-workers (1994) showed that in the presence of lauric acid, the production of infectious vesicular stomatitis virus was inhibited in a dose-dependent and reversible manner: after removal of lauric acid, the antiviral effect disappeared. They observed that lauric acid did not influence viral membrane (M) protein synthesis, but prevented the binding of viral M proteins to the host cell membrane. Although lauric acid accounts for much of the reported antiviral activity of coconut oil, capric acid (C10) and monocaprin have also shown promising activity against other viruses, such as HIV-1 (Kristmundsdóttir et al., 1999). Capric acid accounts for about 7% of coconut oil. Thus, at least two fatty acids in coconut oil, and their monoglycerides, have antiviral properties. Hilarsson and co-workers (2007) tested virucidal activities of fatty acids, monoglycerides and fatty alcohols against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus type 2 (HPIV2) at different concentrations, times and pH levels. They reported the most active compound tested was monocaprin (C10), which also showed activity against influenza A virus and significant virucidal activities even at a concentration as low as 0.06-0.12%. Use of coconut oil and C12 derivatives in animals and humans Coconut oil and its derivatives have been shown to be safe and effective antiviral compounds in both humans and animals. Because of the antiviral and antibacterial protection that it provides to animals, coconut oil, as well as lauric acid and monolaurin, is used in farm animals and pets as veterinary feed supplements in chicken, swine and dogs (Baltic et al., 2017). Monolaurin has been shown to effectively protect chicken against avian influenza virus (van der Sluis, 2015). Li and co- workers (2009) prepared a gel containing monolaurin and found it to be highly active against repeated high viral loads of Simean immunodeficiency virus in macaques and Kirtane and co- workers (2017) developed a 35% gel of monolaurin for application in the female genital tract to protect against HIV. Sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) has been used at low concentrations to inactivate viruses in milk of farm animals (de Sousa et al., 2019). SLS is the active constituent in commercial disinfecting wipes and standard laboratory disinfectants, and is an emulsifying agent and penetration enhancer in pharmaceutical preparations.",25,Low,,USA

Fear over the coronavirus is gripping the nation and world, as within a short period of time life around the globe has drastically changed very suddenly.

The main question facing everyone in the U.S. today is: How serious is this? Is the response the government is making right now consistent with the threat this virus presents?

Some are proposing that anyone in the media who dares to question the official narrative should be silenced for the sake of “public health.”

Facebook, for example, took strong actions against Health Impact News by claiming we were publishing “fake news,” mainly by publishing the views of Dr. Andrew W. Saul, Editor of the Orthomolecular Medicine News Service, who published news about successful intravenous Vitamin C therapy which had started in China. See:

And yet this week, the New York Post reported that the same therapy had started at hospitals in New York City. See:

With the Coronavirus situation affecting virtually every single person on the planet right now, suppressing alternative information that goes against the “mainstream” narrative is a very dangerous precedent, and is a clear violation of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment which protects freedom of speech and freedom of the press.

It is especially concerning when one of my colleagues in the alternative media, without even contacting me directly, publicly demands that we retract one of our articles authored by a medical doctor, simply because this person believes his view of the current situation is the only correct view.

I do not pretend to be an expert on medical science, which is why Health Impact News publishes alternative views by medical doctors and other scientists who are experts in their field.

During difficult days like the ones currently facing us, I believe the public has a right to read all sides of the issue and make up their own minds. Caution is certainly prudent, but fear?

Among all the Fear, Where is Faith in God?

The opposite of fear is “faith.”

Have we lost our way as a nation? Does the phrase inscribed on our currency “In God we Trust” mean anything anymore?

Faith in God does NOT mean we will not face difficult times. On the contrary, often those who are most faithful face the most difficult trials in life.

Faith in God means we trust that there is a stronger power than ourselves controlling the affairs of humanity, and that if we trust in him, he will give us the strength to endure whatever trials come our way.

Quick decisions based on fear seldom turn out well.

I will not pretend to know what is going to happen in the immediate future, and I do not claim to be a mouthpiece for God to tell you what to do.

My own personal belief system trusts God, and I also believe that in this point of history, being on this side of the death and resurrection of the Messiah Jesus Christ, whose sacrificial death on the cross paid the penalty for all of our sins, means that every single person can have a direct pipeline to God if they will just seek him.

God has a specific plan for your life, and only YOU can know that by seeking him out during these difficult days.

Don’t listen to me or anyone else who claims to know what God’s plan is for your life, because he is more than willing to lead you and guide you if you seek him out.

Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and the door will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives; he who seeks finds; and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a snake? If you, then, though you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good gifts to those who ask him!

(Matthew 7:7-11)

I, for my part, will endeavor to give you as much information as possible, which will often contradict what the corporate-sponsored “mainstream” media reports, and may also contradict what others in the Alternative Media are writing.

For today, here are the perspectives of 12 medical scientists who are concerned about the current narrative being reported in the mainstream media.

Thanks to Off-Guardian.org for putting this together.

12 Experts Questioning the Coronavirus Panic

Dr Sucharit Bhakdi is a specialist in microbiology. He was a professor at the Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz and head of the Institute for Medical Microbiology and Hygiene and one of the most cited research scientists in German history.

What he says:

We are afraid that 1 million infections with the new virus will lead to 30 deaths per day over the next 100 days. But we do not realise that 20, 30, 40 or 100 patients positive for normal coronaviruses are already dying every day. [The government’s anti-COVID19 measures] are grotesque, absurd and very dangerous […] The life expectancy of millions is being shortened. The horrifying impact on the world economy threatens the existence of countless people. The consequences on medical care are profound. Already services to patients in need are reduced, operations cancelled, practices empty, hospital personnel dwindling. All this will impact profoundly on our whole society. All these measures are leading to self-destruction and collective suicide based on nothing but a spook.

Dr Wolfgang Wodarg is a German physician specialising in Pulmonology, politician and former chairman of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe. In 2009 he called for an inquiry into alleged conflicts of interest surrounding the EU response to the Swine Flu pandemic.

What he says:

Politicians are being courted by scientists…scientists who want to be important to get money for their institutions. Scientists who just swim along in the mainstream and want their part of it […] And what is missing right now is a rational way of looking at things. We should be asking questions like “How did you find out this virus was dangerous?”, “How was it before?”, “Didn’t we have the same thing last year?”, “Is it even something new?” That’s missing.

Dr Joel Kettner is professor of Community Health Sciences and Surgery at Manitoba University, former Chief Public Health Officer for Manitoba province and Medical Director of the International Centre for Infectious Diseases.

What he says:

I have never seen anything like this, anything anywhere near like this. I’m not talking about the pandemic, because I’ve seen 30 of them, one every year. It is called influenza. And other respiratory illness viruses, we don’t always know what they are. But I’ve never seen this reaction, and I’m trying to understand why. […] I worry about the message to the public, about the fear of coming into contact with people, being in the same space as people, shaking their hands, having meetings with people. I worry about many, many consequences related to that. […] In Hubei, in the province of Hubei, where there has been the most cases and deaths by far, the actual number of cases reported is 1 per 1000 people and the actual rate of deaths reported is 1 per 20,000. So maybe that would help to put things into perspective.

Dr John Ioannidis Professor of Medicine, of Health Research and Policy and of Biomedical Data Science, at Stanford University School of Medicine and a Professor of Statistics at Stanford University School of Humanities and Sciences. He is director of the Stanford Prevention Research Center, and co-director of the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford (METRICS).

He is also the editor-in-chief of the European Journal of Clinical Investigation. He was chairman at the Department of Hygiene and Epidemiology, University of Ioannina School of Medicine as well as adjunct professor at Tufts University School of Medicine.

As a physician, scientist and author he has made contributions to evidence-based medicine, epidemiology, data science and clinical research. In addition, he pioneered the field of meta-research. He has shown that much of the published research does not meet good scientific standards of evidence.

Editor, Health Impact News

The COVID-19 pandemic has created an instant market for vaccine development. Around $1 billion of U.S. taxpayer funds have already been given to Big Pharma to develop the much coveted COVID-19 mRNA vaccine, a new class of vaccines that have never before been successfully developed. ($450 million to Johnson & Johnson in March, and $483 million to Moderna Therapeutics in April.)

At least another $2 billion is being spent by the Bill Gates-founded Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI).

And this is all just for starters, as over 100 COVID-19 vaccines are currently in development by most of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. The CARES Act signed into law on Mar. 27, 2020 allocates $27 billion for COVID-19 vaccine development, just in the U.S. alone.

And if that wasn’t enough, earlier this week (May, 2020) President Trump seemingly gave a blank check to spend as much as possible to fast track a COVID-19 vaccine through “Operation Warp Speed,” a coalition of scientists, government officials, military agencies, and private companies led by Alex Azar, the Health and Human Services Secretary, and Mark Esper, the Defense Secretary.

Their goal: to deliver 300 million doses of coronavirus vaccine from November to December 2020 and another 300 million by January 2021. (Source.)

So just by starting to research a COVID-19 vaccine, the already lucrative pharmaceutical industry just became the all-time most profitable industry on the planet.

As pharmaceutical companies compete with each other to get a COVID-19 vaccine to market, there was initial skepticism that an mRNA vaccine could be developed anytime soon. Projections were that it would take about 5 years, and even then only with a small chance of success. See:

Now, as we saw earlier this week with the announcement of the new “Operation Warp Speed” project, the projections are to produce enough vaccines to be able to inject all 350 million citizens of the United States by the end of 2020.

And on May 1st this week Moderna Therapeutics announced a partnership with Lonza manufacturing to start producing 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines a year.

Moderna Therapeutics is partnering with Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), who also has close ties to Bill Gates.

Bill Gates said in an interview this week that 7 billion vaccine doses are needed to end the COVID-19 pandemic, which is about the number of people currently living on the planet.

Will the entire world’s population just volunteer to get this vaccine, or are the drug companies counting on the fact that they will become mandatory?

The world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, the Serum Institute of India, which produces 1.5 billion vaccine doses a year for an array of diseases, said it was not going to wait for approval of a COVID-19 vaccine, but would start manufacturing them immediately, starting with 40 million doses. They are currently working with the the Oxford Vaccine Group. (Source.)

It would seem that pharmaceutical companies manufacturing a COVID-19 vaccine are banking on the fact that the World Health Organization will recommend that they be mandatory.

Will the U.S. comply?

Is President Trump is the Key to Mandatory COVID-19 Vaccines in the U.S.?

There are good reasons why vaccine industry insiders balked at the idea of developing an mRNA vaccine so quickly initially. They have tried to develop them in the past, with dismal results. They were unsuccessful in trying to develop this kind of vaccine for other coronaviruses, like SARS and MERS.

Dr. Fauci and the NIH, working together with Bill Gates, also previously had dismal results in developing this kind of vaccine for HIV/AIDS.

But all of that has now changed with the world-wide “pandemic” of COVID-19.

President Trump can now eliminate safety tests normally required for FDA approval of drugs and vaccines, by invoking the “Emergency Use Authorization” authority which “allows FDA to help strengthen the nation’s public health protections against CBRN threats by facilitating the availability and use of MCMs needed during public health emergencies.”

According to the FDA website:

President Trump invoked this authority this week (May, 2020) in directing the FDA to approve the anti-viral drug remdesivir, which was previously abandoned as a treatment for Ebola.

“I’m pleased to announce that Gilead now has a EUA (emergency use authorization) from the FDA for remdesivir — and you know what that is, because that’s been the hot thing also in the papers and in the media for the last little while,” the president said. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn confirmed the authorization “was issued today.” (Source.)

This is like a dream come true for pharmaceutical companies. A pandemic allows them to secure government funds to research new drugs.

It allows them to bypass normal FDA safety testing with legal immunity should things go wrong and people are injured or die from the side effects.

Then the government, who paid for the research and development, ends up spending more of your taxpayer funds to purchase these vaccines through the CDC, and then requires the American population to receive them, while selling the excess vaccines produced that the American public does not use to the World Health Organization to be mandated upon citizens of other countries.

With the announcement earlier this week that Moderna Therapeutics has developed a partnership with Lonza manufacturing to start producing 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines a year, it would seem that they are the leading candidate at this point to benefit the most, especially since they are working in partnership with Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of President Trump’s Coronavirus task force team.

The Moderna – Lonza partnership was huge news this week, as Fauci said back in February that even if they had a vaccine that would work, it would be difficult to produce so many so quickly:

Production would require an amount of time that’s as “problematic” as developing the shot itself, Fauci said. (Source.)

Fauci also allegedly stated that once Moderna reached phase 2 testing of the vaccine, that it would be tested in China, suggesting that he is still working closely with the World Health Organization, and looking at supplying his COVID-19 vaccine to the entire world. (Source.)

Do you want to be required to receive an experimental COVID-19 vaccine that has been fast-tracked and where the drug companies have no risk or liability should anything go wrong?

If not, President Trump is the probably the only one who can stop this, and it is time that the American public lets him know that we will not comply.

Editor, Health Impact News

We have featured the articles published by Michigan physician Dr. David Brownstein for many years here at Health Impact News.

But we were just notified that his blog has been shut down, apparently to suppress the information he was publishing that went against Big Pharma and their narrative regarding COVID-19.

As we have previously reported, Dr. Brownstein has had tremendous success treating COVID-19 patients successfully with holistic non-pharmaceutical methods.

According to a notice put up on his website, the FTC ordered him to stop blogging:

Dear CHM Patients-

I want to let you know that we have been ordered by the FTC to stop making any statements about our treatment protocols of Vitamins A, C and D as well as nutritional IV’s, iodine, ozone and nebulization to support the immune system with respect to Coronavirus Diseases 2019 (COVID-19). According to this letter: “It is unlawful under the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C Sec. 41 et seq. to advertise that a product or service can prevent, treat, or cure human disease unless you possess competent and reliable scientific evidence, including, when appropriate, well-controlled human clinical studies, substantiating that the claims are true at the time they are made. For COVID-19, no such study is currently known to exist for the products or services identified above. Thus, any Coronavirus-related prevention or treatment claims regarding such products or services are not supported by competent and reliable scientific evidence. You must immediately cease making all such claims.” What this means is that I will not be able to blog, post, tweet, email, etc. for awhile. I want you to know that CHM is NOT closing. I am still here and so are my colleagues. It is my honor to be your doctor. To All Our Health! ~DrB

The articles we have published on our website authored by Dr. Brownstein remain, and are protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.

Unfortunately, as a licensed physician, Dr. Brownstein has stricter regulations on what he can publish since he charges for his services.

This does NOT mean he has done anything wrong or illegal, it just probably means he has neither the time nor resources to fight this in court right now, where he would probably win on Constitutional grounds.

This was one of Dr. Brownstein’s last blog entries regarding the wearing of masks, which criticized Governor Whitmer (which is NOT illegal!).

We Must Wear Face Masks? Show Me the Science Behind That!

by Dr. Brownstein

Folks, I have been writing to you about COVID for over a month. It is been a painful time period for all of us.

What is really sad is that too many political dictates are being fostered on us without any good scientific evidence to back them up. One of those requirements that has me irritated is the use of face coverings that I see so prevalent out there.

When I go to Costco, 95% of the people in the store are wearing face masks.

Why is that?

The Governor of Michigan recently released an edict requiring that citizens wear a face covering when in any enclosed public space.

It specifically states, “Any individual able to medically tolerate a face covering must wear a covering over his or her nose and mouth—such as a homemade mask, scarf, bandana, or handkerchief—when in any enclosed public space.”

Later in the edict, it states, “Supplies of N95 masks and surgical masks should generally be reserved, for now, for health care professionals, first responders and other critical workers who interact with the public.”

It should be well known that cloth masks, bandanas, or handkerchiefs will do very little to stop the spread of coronavirus. In fact, they may actually increase your risk of becoming ill from corona and other influenza-like illnesses.

A 2015 study found cloth masks, when compared to surgical masks, increase the rate of influenza-like illnesses 13x! (1) Cloth masks are probably best avoided and should not be reused without properly sanitizing them.

Regular surgical masks are not much better in this situation. The COVID-19 virus is 0.125 µm in size. Surgical masks have been shown to not adequately filter against aerosols measuring from 0.9-3.1 µm. (2)

Other researchers have shown that particles from 0.04-0.2 µm can penetrate surgical masks. (3)

A 2020 study in Seoul, South Korea looked at the effectiveness of surgical and cotton masks in blocking COVID-19 in a controlled comparison of four patients. (4)

The COVID-infected patients were put in negative pressure isolated rooms. The scientists compared disposable surgical masks (3 layers) with reusable cotton masks.

Patients were instructed to cough 5 times while wearing no mask, surgical mask, or cotton mask. Interestingly, all swabs from the outer masks—including surgical masks—were positive for COVID-19.

Inner masks were also found to be contaminated. That means the mask did not effectively filter out the COVID virus since it is too small. The authors state, “Neither surgical nor cotton masks effectively filtered {COVID-19} during coughs by infected patients.”

The study also reported greater contamination on the outer than the inner mask (both surgical and cotton) surfaces.

The authors claim that the mask is either allowing the virus to cross from the inner to the outer surface because the virus is too small or the aerodynamic feature of a mask could explain this finding. A turbulent jet due to air leakage around the mask edge could contaminate the outer surface.

We have made far too many political decisions in the COVID crisis based on fear and not on reliable data. Here is a perfect example of another one: everyone must wear a mask when inside any public place.

Should you wear a mask? If you are coughing or sick, my answer is yes. A surgical mask, and to a lesser extent a cotton mask, will block large droplets from being spread.

However, should we dictate to healthy people that they are required to wear a mask—cotton or surgical—when in any public enclosed space? Someone show me the science supporting the Executive Order by the Governor of Michigan. And Governor Whitmer wonders why so many of us are annoyed.

To All Our Health,

~DrB

Addendum: A further annoyance is my lack of success in getting masks—both N95 and surgical masks– for my staff to use when we are treating COVID patients. Perhaps the Governor should release an executive order helping us get the PPE equipment we need. We have had masks, gowns and face shields on order for over two months. That is beyond annoying.

Daily Post

Excerpts:

The Coalition of United Political Parties (CUPP), on Monday (May 4, 2020), alleged that it has intercepted a human intelligence report that the Nigeria House of Representatives leadership was poised to forcefully pass the compulsory vaccine bill without subjecting it to the traditions of legislative proceedings.

In a statement issued and signed by the spokesperson of the opposition political parties, Barrister Ikenga Imo Ugochinyere and sent to DAILY POST in Abuja on Monday, the body urged lawmakers in the lower chamber to rise against impunity.

The body in the statement alleged that a sum of $10 million was offered by the American Computer Czar, Bill Gates to influence the speedy passage of the bill without recourse to legislative public hearing, a development they averted as anachronistic, adding that the Speaker, Femi Gbajabiamila should be impeached if he forces the bill on members.

The statement read:

“Opposition Coalition (CUPP) has intercepted very credible intelligence and hereby alerts Nigerians of plans by the leadership of the House of Representatives led by Femi Gbajabiamila to forcefully and without adherence to the rules of lawmaking to pass the Control of Infectious Diseases Bill 2020 otherwise known as the Compulsory Vaccination Bill which is proposing a compulsory vaccination of all Nigerians even when the vaccines have not been discovered. “This intelligence is coupled with the information of the alleged receipt, from sources outside the country but very interested in the Bill, of the sum of $10 million by the sponsors and promoters of the Bill to distribute among lawmakers to ensure a smooth passage of the Bill. “The Nigeria opposition rejects the Bill and urges opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives to confront the Speaker of the House with these facts tomorrow at plenary and resist every plan to illegally pass the Bill. “We have been informed that the alleged deal on the passage of the Bill was struck during a trip to Austria a few months back while the financial support for the promotion of the Bill was allegedly received last week to mobilize for a push leading to the hurried attempt to pass the Bill by any means necessary. “Nigerians are reminded that at present, there is no discovered/approved vaccine anywhere in the world and one now begins to wonder why the hurry to pass a Bill for a compulsory vaccine when there is none. “What if the world eventually does not find a vaccine or cure for coronavirus just like it has not found a cure for HIV AIDS? What is the hurry in passing a Bill based on speculation or is there anything else the leadership of the House would want to tell Nigerians? Is this bill what will stop the mass deaths and infections rising in Lagos, Kano, Abuja, Gombe, Borno, Kaduna, Ogun, Bauchi and indeed all over the country? “Is this Bill going to revive and grow the economy and reduce hunger and give us more testing kits or bed spaces? Is this Bill going to stop the stealing of palliatives meant for poor and vulnerable Nigerians? Is it true that all these noises for the Bill is all for the alleged $10 million? “Why make a law for a vaccine that has not been discovered? Does it mean that Femi Gbajabiamila and the promoters have an idea of the vaccine and when it will be ready? When nations like Madagascar are making local remedies which is working, APC is making a law to compulsorily inject Nigerians with vaccines our former slave masters have not yet discovered. “The plan to push the passing of the bill is evil.” “The Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC did not make any contributions to the drafting of the Bill and has even told Femi Gbajabiamila to suspend the Bill as the timing is very wrong but Mr. Gbajabiamila believes he can secure the silence and acquiescence of the NCDC with all the illegal powers been provided for the NCDC in the Bill hence he still wants to push ahead with it the passage. “We are saying loudly again and calling on House of Representatives to suspend this Control of Infectious Diseases Bill and await for proper input and scrutiny after the pandemic and charge all efforts towards giving the needed support to reduce the spread and find a homegrown solution.”

Infectious Diseases Bill: Nigerian youths blow hurt, reveal what will happen to lawmakers

By John Owen Nwachukwu

Daily Post

Excerpts:

Youth leaders across the country, under the aegis of the Coalition Against Vaccine Trial in Nigeria, CAVTIN, have issued a stern warning to the leadership of the National Assembly over the controversial ‘Control of Infectious Diseases Bill.’

The youths threatened to embark on all actions that are within legal means to ensure that the bill is not passed.

They also threatened to start a recall process of all the lawmakers involved in the attempt to pass the Bill.

The Coalition wondered why the House of Representatives, without warning and with malevolent alacrity, could engage in a plot to push through what it described as a very contentious and troubling bill.

The Bill was sponsored by the Speaker of the House, Femi Gbajabiamila, and two other members: Dr. Paschal Chigozie Obi, member representing Ideato North /Ideato South Federal constituency of Imo State and Rep. Sununu Tanko Yusuf, member representing Yauri/Shanga/Ngaski Federal Constituency of Kebbi State.

In a statement signed by Alhaji Aliyu Buba Amshi, North East; Segun Onibiyo, Secretary, Vanguards Of Democracy North Central; Ibrahim Bunu, Middle Belt Patriotic Front; Nze Ugo-Akpe Onwuka (OYI), International Coordinator – Igbo Renaissance Forum (IRF) South East; Sammy Brown, President, Supreme Council Of Ibibio Youths, South South; and Eric Oluwole, Yoruba National Youth Leader; South West, the Coalition said:

“One begins to wonder why the lightning speed to get the bill passed without being dully scrutinized by honorable members of the House, who incidentally were not presented with copies of the Wonder BILL. “As if that was not enough, while the citizens were still trying to grasp the movie-like actions playing out, the same controversial bill seeking to repeal the Quarantine Act 2004 sponsored by the House of Representatives, surfaced at the Senate on Tuesday the 5th of May, 2020, under a different title which read ‘National Health Emergency Bill, 2020’,” the Coalition noted.” “We wish to state without equivocation that no matter the nomenclature of the bill, we shall resist it unless Nigerians are adequately educated and sensitized about the benefits of giving such unfettered powers to the Nigeria Centre For Disease Control (NCDC), which includes forcible administering of the COVID-19 vaccine.” “We, however, want to know if the vaccine trial has passed Phase 1- 3 before we jumped into offering our citizens as guinea pigs.” “Does Nigeria have the experience and capacity to run a candidate trial? “We are not going to sound nice nor complementary in presenting our feelings about the unfortunate games that we see being played with the lives of Nigerians at this very critical time, when COVID – 19 and hardship occasioned by the unplanned lockdown action has brought upon the citizens.” “We are by this publication putting the government on notice that Nigerians would not be led to the slaughter like sheep, and citizens cannot to be used as guinea pigs for vaccine trials.” “We shall resist any attempts by any individual, group of persons or organizations that would want to begin vaccine trials of any kind without first of all going through the right protocols and sensitizing the citizenry.”

The youth leaders declared that these uncommunicative gymnastics, change of document title and sleight of mouth to throw dust in the eyes of the citizens was dead on arrival.

Infectious Disease Bill: ‘Why the rush’ – Christian leaders blast Nigerian lawmakers

By Wale Odunsi

The Daily Post

Excerpts:

The Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) has kicked against the bill on Infectious Disease Control before the House of Representatives.

CAN, in a statement on Tuesday by General Secretary, Joseph Daramola, queried “the rush” to allow the bill to be passed into law with jet speed.

“The question in the hearts of many people is this: Why the rush when the vaccine is not available yet?,” they quipped.

The Christian leadership gave reasons it was against the moves by the Nigerian lawmakers.

CAN said the bill:

“was initiated to destroy the Civil and Human Rights of Nigerians; that it prevents Nigerians from having a say in their own affairs.” “Among this denial of the fundamental human rights are: right to life, personal liberty, freedom from inhuman treatment, privacy, right to acquire/own property, freedom of movement and religion.” “These rights are held sacred and invaluable except on clearly defined occasions as provided for by the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.”

CAN reminded the federal legislators that the courts in Nigeria, on numerous occasions, struck out Acts of Parliaments and Legislation including Executive Orders of Governments, that were against fundamental human rights.

The body told them to:

“allow the Spirit of God to prevail over the primordial intentions and ambition; not to pass this controversial, nebulous and obnoxious bill into law in the overall interest of Nigerians”.
