Hundreds of thousands have died and millions of cases have been reported worldwide in the covid-19 pandemic, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The United States is now the outbreakâs epicenter, with more recorded deaths and reported infections than any other country.

Several countries are confirming thousands of new cases of covid-19 each day, led by the United States, where testing was slow to begin.

On March 31, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the pandemic âthe most challenging crisis we have faced since the Second World War.â

The disease, which can trigger severe respiratory symptoms, has been reported on every continent except Antarctica and in at least 180 countries. The World Health Organization declared covid-19 a pandemic on March 11.

The U.S. total of reported cases is by far the highest in the world. Covid-19 has been confirmed in every state and in most U.S. territories. As more tests are performed, many states are seeing rapid growth in the number of known cases.

In the early months, China, where the outbreak originated last year, reported more cases than any other country. Its tally of new infections peaked in mid-February and approached zero by mid-March, although questions surround the accuracy of its data.

While the virus appears to have plateaued or declined in much of Europe, many countries in South America, South Asia and the Middle East have reported increases in the number of cases.

As the disease waned in China, it began to surge in Italy and Spain. By May, more than 150,000 people had died throughout Europe.

Coronaviruses range from some common cold viruses to those that cause much more serious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some strains spread more efficiently than others; the virus that causes covid-19 seems to spread easily from person to person, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

“Once she had her mind made up about something, Aunt Edna’s was the only opinion that mattered.”

Edna Adams, 105, a woman of faith and conviction, spent her life defying expectations. She lived through the 1918 flu pandemic, women’s suffrage, the Great Depression and two world wars. After her husband died, she lived alone for more than 40 years, moving into a nursing home after her 100th birthday. She fell ill there in April and died days later, becoming the District of Columbia’s oldest coronavirus victim.

AD

He also attacked former vice president Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, and boasted about crowd sizes at President Trump’s political events.

AD

“They think they’re taking away Donald Trump’s greatest tool, which is being able to go into an arena and fill it with 50,000 people every single time,” he said.

The Biden campaign pushed back against Trump’s comments, calling them “unbelievably reckless.”

“We’re in the middle of the biggest public health emergency in a century, with almost 90,000 Americans dead, 1.5 million infected, and 36 million workers newly jobless,” Biden communications director Kate Bedingfield said in a statement. “So for Eric Trump to claim that the coronavirus is a political hoax that will ‘magically’ disappear is absolutely stunning and unbelievably reckless.”

AD

She also accused the Trump administration of being “desperate to do whatever they can to throw up a smokescreen to try to conceal his historic mismanagement of this crisis.”

AD

Leading health officials have repeatedly warned that the coronavirus will not go away by fall and that a surge in cases toward the end of the year could be even harder to manage than the current outbreak.

Anthony S. Fauci, the government’s top infectious-disease expert, said late last month that the global spread of the disease made it “inevitable” that the coronavirus would return or linger beyond the fall. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Washington Post a second wave of covid-19 could be worse than the first because it would coincide with the flu season.

AD

President Trump himself has acknowledged the pandemic will remain a public health problem for months. Earlier this month, he said that although he is convinced covid-19 will disappear on its own, it “doesn’t mean it’s going to be gone, frankly, by fall or after the fall.”"

“No workers should give their lives to do that, Mr. Senator, and I think your characterization is unfair,” Mnuchin responded.

AD

President Trump has said in the past that it is possible the push to reopen parts of the economy quickly could lead to more deaths, but his advisers have said numerous precautions are being taken to prevent problems.

AD

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell also testified at the hearing. He and Mnuchin were asked numerous questions about whether the government was acting quickly enough to try to arrest the economic downturn. Powell also told lawmakers that more spending could help prevent the recession from deepening.

The hearing marked the first time two of the main architects of the government’s economic response testified together before a congressional panel, and it came as policymakers are increasingly divided about how to address the pandemic’s economic fallout. Powell has called for Congress to approve more programs to ensure economic growth, while Mnuchin said Tuesday he is still working to erect programs that were authorized two months ago.

AD

Mnuchin also warned there could be severe economic trauma if policymakers do not act swiftly to reopen businesses, reflecting the urgency that has taken hold at the White House in recent weeks.

AD

“There is the risk of permanent damage,” Mnuchin said at the hearing, while stressing the need for the economic reopening to be done safely. He also said the economy would continue to weaken, at least in the short term.

“I think the jobs numbers will be worse before they get better,"" Mnuchin said.

A number of Democrats at the hearing attacked the White House’s response. Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) said Mnuchin should be more forthcoming about where all the stimulus money is being spent, telling him “We need more transparency.” Mnuchin responded by saying there had been “unprecedented transparency” so far, but Tester said that was not the case.

AD

Brown repeatedly asked Mnuchin and Powell whether it was “fair” that essential workers putting their lives on the line at work while being among the lowest-paid in the economy. Neither Mnuchin nor Powell would specifically say whether this was fair.

AD

The very terms of the hearing came under dispute as Mnuchin said he had been prepared to testify in person. Brown devoted part of his opening statement to railing against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) for bringing the Senate back into session, which Brown said was putting Senate workers at risk.

The hearing was supposed to focus on the nearly $3 trillion Congress has approved to respond to the coronavirus crisis, including a $500 billion fund managed by the Treasury and the Fed. Lawmakers of both parties pressed Mnuchin and Powell to move faster on hundreds of billions in lending to businesses, cities and states and others.

AD

“The Cares Act is the biggest rescue package in the history of Congress, and we need to make sure the dollars and program quickly find their mark,"" Senate Banking Committee Chairman Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) said at the outset of the hearing.

In his own opening statement, Mnuchin touted his work with Congress “to get relief into the hands of hard-working Americans and businesses as quickly as possible. While these are unprecedented and difficult times, these programs are making a positive impact on people.”

Powell discussed the Fed’s role in backstopping hundreds of billions of loans that are supposed to go to businesses large and small and shore up other parts of the economy. A report by a Congressional Oversight Commission on Monday found that only a small portion of a $500 billion Treasury fund created by the Cares Act has been committed.

AD

Congress’s $2 trillion Cares Act, passed in late March, mandates quarterly testimony from Powell and Mnuchin to Capitol Hill.

Lawmakers of both parties have questioned why the Fed has yet to launch its Main Street Lending Facility, aimed at helping businesses that are too large to qualify for a separate small business program — and why the central bank recently altered the terms of that program to aid companies with up to 15,000 employees, a move some Democrats say mainly benefits struggling oil and gas firms.

AD

Crapo questioned Mnuchin and Powell about a municipal lending fund and what types of cities could qualify for it. Congress allocated $150 billion for cities and states under the Cares Act, but governors and Democratic lawmakers have been pushing for more assistance. The Treasury and Fed set up a municipal lending facility within the $500 billion Treasury fund, but it has yet to send out any money.

AD

Powell said they were looking at ways to make it work.

The hearing took place amid debate about Congress’s next steps in responding to the virus outbreak. House Democrats last week passed a bill allocating another $3 trillion more, but Senate Republicans and the White House rejected it. Senate Republicans and administration officials say they want to pause and see how the money already approved is working before agreeing to any more. Some have even suggested that no more federal spending will be necessary at all, as the Trump administration makes bullish predictions about economic growth.

AD

Democrats have pointed to comments last week from Powell suggesting that spending more money might be necessary but worth it.

AD

Sen. Patrick J. Toomey (R-Pa.) said Powell’s comments had been “mischaracterized” as calling on Congress to pass a new spending bill, saying the Federal Reserve had been more nuanced and acknowledged the costs of new spending. Powell did not respond to that interpretation of his remarks.

“I think you could make a pretty strong case before we rush out and do another spending bill we let some of this stuff go to work,” Toomey said.

Ahead of the hearing, Mnuchin — who has been the Trump administration’s point person in negotiating relief bills — met with McConnell and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), along with Vice President Pence to discuss the economic situation and potential next steps. Trump himself plans to meet with Senate Republicans at their weekly policy lunch on Tuesday.

The White House’s rosy view of the U.S. economy’s trajectory clashes with the dire predictions of many mainstream economists, as well as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell, who is set to testify before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday alongside Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

AD

Powell said last week that lawmakers should strongly consider passing additional stimulus measures to avoid a severe and prolonged economic downturn. The unemployment rate rocketed from 3.5 percent in February to 14.7 percent in April, and it is projected to continue climbing.

Many economists and Wall Street analysts say the unemployment rate could remain above 10 percent into 2021 — a level unseen since the Great Depression — even if lawmakers approve more emergency aid. Powell said in a “60 Minutes” interview that it could eclipse 25 percent later this year.

AD

White House economic officials believe some of these trends can be quickly reversed. They are monitoring the reopening of states such as Georgia and Texas with cautious optimism that they could presage a broader recovery, according to two people in communication with them who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks.

AD

On Monday, White House economist Kevin Hassett cited what he called positive economic trends in retail, business reopenings, and credit card transaction data over the past two weeks. He said the administration has “a little bit of a luxury to watch and see” before having to approve additional aid.

“I’ve been really positively impressed by how quickly things are turning around,” Hassett told reporters on Monday. He added at a separate White House event: “I was pretty depressed about how bad it looked a few weeks ago, but you can really see it turning on faster than I thought.""

AD

Numerous economists and the leader of the nation’s central bank are strongly warning against too sunny a view of the economic recovery. Critics say Trump and his aides have for months overstated how quickly the economy might rebound, and the White House risks exacerbating the already devastating economic impact of the virus by delaying additional emergency assistance.

AD

Few economists outside the White House are talking about a “V” shaped recovery anymore, a scenario in which the economy rebounds just as quickly as it plummeted. Analysts believe major threats to the economy will persist even if states fully relax their public health restrictions because many Americans will not quickly return to work and consumer spending will lag.

AD

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has projected an unemployment rate of above 10 percent for 2020 and 2021. Goldman Sachs has similarly projected the unemployment rate could remain at 10 percent by the end of this year, even with an additional aid package.

Powell has urged Congress and Trump to consider spending more money to aid the economy. In the “60 Minutes” interview broadcast Sunday, he urged lawmakers to focus on helping the unemployed pay their bills and assisting small businesses, many of which can only partially reopen. He warned the recovery is likely to be slow and could take until the end of 2021.

AD

“If we let people be out of work for long periods of time, if we let businesses fail unnecessarily, waves of them, there’ll be longer-term damage to the economy. The recovery will be slower,” Powell said in the “60 Minutes” interview. “The good news is we can avoid that by providing more support now.""

AD

The White House appears to be unlikely to approve help soon. Administration officials aren’t engaged in serious negotiations with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) over the $3 trillion aid package approved by the House on Friday, according to a congressional aide.

The rate of economic growth probably will increase in the third quarter, analysts say, but even a dramatic increase may be insignificant given the steep contraction in the period from April to June. Among economists at big companies, 86 percent expect the U.S. economy will decline between March 2020 and March 2021, according to a survey of more than 100 economists last month who are part of the National Association of Business Economics.

AD

“What matters to people is not GDP rates, seasonally adjusted at an annual growth rate,” said Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan. “It is the labor market and unemployment and jobs. And it’s very likely that, by the end of the year, the unemployment rate could still be north of 10 percent.”

AD

When the unemployment rate is high, Americans tend to pull back markedly on spending, which creates a huge drag on the economy. It can take a long time for consumer confidence to recover, a necessary step before Americans begin resuming sizable purchases.

On Monday, White House officials voiced increasing optimism about the economic recovery despite these dire predictions. Larry Kudlow, director of the White House’s National Economic Council, cited improvements in housing and gasoline demand, as well as an increase in the New York State manufacturing index.

AD

“Unemployment claims look terrible, but they look a lot less terrible,” Kudlow said at a White House event with restaurant executives. “Things are starting to turn — that’s my take.”

AD

Trump has for weeks been the leading cheerleader of a rapid economic recovery, saying in early April it will take off “like a rocket ship” after the virus is contained. The president’s confidence in a “spectacular” economic comeback is shared by White House officials, said Stephen Moore, an economic adviser to the White House at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.

“From the people at the White House I talked to over the weekend, there’s a renewed sense of optimism that things are working out,” Moore said. “They feel like the direction of things is good, very positive, in terms of the sense of crisis is lessening, and that this is playing up pretty much as had been hoped.”

AD

White House officials have maintained they will step in and approve more aid if subsequent economic data shows it is necessary. Mnuchin has also proved willing to negotiate with congressional Democrats, helping to spearhead the $2 trillion Cares Act passed in March.

AD

Hassett said existing federal efforts have involved “really, really big — massive interventions” bigger than the efforts in the New Deal of the 1930s.

“It’s at least appropriate to see how they go,” Hassett said.

Some White House officials have also quietly signaled their openness to additional aid for states and cities, despite internal angst among some senior advisers about the growing deficit, suggesting the administration’s flexibility on additional spending measures. There is growing concern that state budget cuts could lead to large numbers of layoffs, which could create major political problems ahead of the presidential election in November.

AD

“I don’t think, politically, that Senate Republicans or the White House can withstand the pressure from more bad economic news and the media drumbeat suggesting more help needs to come,” one senior Republican aide said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to frankly describe internal dynamics.

Some economists warn that delaying relief measures now could mean more economic pain for Americans later, arguing the White House does not have time to waste.

Claudia Sahm, who served as an economist at the Council of Economic Advisers under the Obama administration, says unemployment could rise above 30 percent without trillions more in emergency federal spending. Downplaying the extent of the economic carnage may be what the president wants to hear, Sahm said, but it could backfire if it results in slower federal action.

Trump and Kudlow have minimized or downplayed the economic threat posed by the coronavirus since the outbreak began in the United States in February, predictions that have since proved incorrect. Kudlow said in late February that the U.S. had a “pretty close to airtight” containment of the virus, which proved untrue.

At the time, the stock market appeared to be ignoring the upbeat statements from White House officials as it fell precipitously. Lately, though, the market appears to be sharing some of the White House’s optimism, even if other measurements of the economy paint a much different picture."

The wave of shutdowns and shuttered economies caused by the coronavirus pandemic fueled a momentous decline in global greenhouse gas emissions, although one unlikely to last, a group of scientists reported Tuesday.

As covid-19 infections surged in March and April, nations worldwide experienced an abrupt reduction in driving, flying and industrial output, leading to a startling decline of more than 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions. That includes a peak decline in daily emissions of 17 percent in early April, according to the study published in the journal Nature Climate Change. For some nations, the drop was much steeper.

Scientists have long insisted that the world must scale back carbon pollution significantly — and quickly — to mitigate the worst effects of climate change over coming decades, although none have suggested that a deadly global pandemic is the way to do so.

Tuesday’s study projects that total emissions for 2020 will probably fall between 4 and 7 percent compared to last year — an unheard-of drop in normal times, but considerably less dramatic than the decline during the first few months of the year when economies screeched to a halt. The final 2020 figure will depend on how rapidly, or cautiously, people around the world resume ordinary life.

The unprecedented situation produced by the coronavirus has offered a glimpse into the massive scale required to cut global emissions, year after year, to meet the most ambitious goals set by world leaders when they forged the 2015 Paris climate accord. Last fall, a U.N. report estimated that global greenhouse gas emissions must begin falling by 7.6 percent each year beginning in 2020 to avoid the worst effects of climate change.

[In bleak report, U.N. says drastic action is only way to avoid worst effects of climate change]

Tuesday’s study underscores how far the world remains from that long-term aspiration. The forced plunge in greenhouse gas emissions in recent months, while extraordinary, returned carbon pollution levels only to those last seen in 2006. And the recent changes are unlikely to last.

“History suggests this will be a blip,” said Rob Jackson, a Stanford professor and one of the authors of the peer-reviewed study, which attempts to assess the virus’s effect by nation and economic sector. “The 2008 [financial] crisis decreased global emissions 1.5 percent for one year, and they shot back up 5 percent in 2010. It was like it never happened.”

Although the decline in emissions during the pandemic may have been unprecedented, it was relatively small when it comes to combating global warming. The peak 17 percent decline in global emissions — which occurred in early April — meant nations continued to generate more than 80 percent of carbon pollution.

Researchers say the experience demonstrates how broad structural changes to the energy system are critical if the world is to slash emissions in a meaningful, sustainable way.

“We can see now that behavior change alone is not going to do it,” said Corinne Le Quéré, lead author of the study and director of Britain’s Tyndall Center for Climate Change Research.

Le Quéré said she expected to find even larger reductions in the power and industrial sectors during the pandemic. Instead, she said, many sources of carbon dioxide and other pollutants have continued steadily, almost on autopilot, even as much of the world has ground to a halt.

Appliances continue to run, office buildings must be maintained and some factories continue to hum.

“There’s a lot of inertia in the infrastructure, in the built environment,” she said. “It seems like many things are able to function on their own, at least for a short time.”

Emissions have fallen before — during world wars and economic recessions, for instance, and markedly during the Great Depression. But experts do not think the modern world has experienced a plunge so sudden and sharp as in recent months.

“In absolute terms, it will be the biggest,” said Glen Peters, one of the study’s authors and an expert at the Center for International Climate Research in Norway. “In relative terms, you will have to go back quite some [time] to find big changes like that.”

Most researchers agree that emissions are all but certain to bounce back once countries reopen. Already, demand for energy is resuming as people return to the roads and many U.S. states begin easing stay-at-home orders that helped drive the price per gallon of gasoline to less than $1 at some pumps.

Governments also are expected to begin trying to boost their economies with stimulus spending in the coming months. But how leaders decide to spend that money could make a fundamental difference.

“Where they put this stimulus is really critical,” Le Quéré said. “It’s 2020, and there’s not much time to tackle climate change.”

Some world leaders have pledged to push for a shift toward greener economies in the wake of the pandemic.

Last week, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said his country’s effort to slash its emissions remains “undiminished” by covid-19 and the economic turmoil it has caused. He singled out airlines during remarks in Parliament last week, saying the sector must limit its carbon emissions even when normal flights resume.

“Inadvertently, the planet this year will [have] greatly reduced its CO2 emissions. … We need to entrench those gains,” Johnson told lawmakers. “I don’t want to see us going back to an era of the same type of emissions as we’ve had in the past. Aviation like every other sector must keep its carbon lower.”

Last month, German Chancellor Angela Merkel indicated that she would support green investments as her nation seeks to restore its economy.

“It will be all the more important that if we set up economic stimulus programs, we must always keep a close eye on climate protection,” Merkel told a gathering of leaders focused on climate change.

The new research was conducted by Le Quéré, Jackson, Peters, and 10 other colleagues affiliated with the Global Carbon Project.

Normally, global emissions are calculated on an annual basis; doing so more rapidly, nearly in real time, presented a scientific challenge. Tuesday’s study used a combination of energy data across multiple sectors, as well as data on the strenuousness of lockdowns across 69 countries that account for 97 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, to estimate the reductions.

The results varied greatly across different sectors. Airplane emissions plunged by as much as 60 percent — but airlines represent a relatively small fraction of global emissions. Emissions from surface transportation, one of the largest sources, fell 36 percent at the peak of the shutdowns.

“Passenger vehicles are down a bit more,” Jackson said. “Commercial vehicles and long-haul trucking are down much less. I’m staying at home, but the Amazon delivery vehicle is still driving around.”

Emissions linked to home energy use actually increased about 3 percent, not surprising during a time when people are confined to their homes, using more appliances, lighting, heating and cooling. But industrial electricity demand plummeted, leading to net electricity declines overall.

Although some aspects of life may change in the wake of the pandemic — more people working remotely, fewer people commuting and taking frequent plane trips — individual changes are unlikely to make much of a long-term mark on emissions, said Zeke Hausfather, a scientist and director of climate and energy at the Breakthrough Institute.

“Unless anything structurally changes, we can expect emissions to go back to where they were before this whole thing happened,” he said.

Hausfather also said that one year of sharp reductions in emissions would do little to stave off the warming that scientists have said will continue unless the world significantly cuts emissions for good.

“I don’t think there’s much of a silver lining to covid-19 for the climate,” he said, “unless we use the recovery as a chance to both stimulate the economy and build the type of infrastructure to support a clean-energy future.”"

Several other Persian Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, have imposed new restrictions recently as cases have increased dramatically following the easing of constraints during the holy month.

Qatar’s announcement followed a cabinet meeting Monday. Starting May 22, all citizens and residents leaving their homes must download the Ehteraz tracking app on their phones so that those coming into contact with someone who tests positive can be tracked. Face masks are also mandatory in Qatar, and violators face jail time and fines of up to $53,000.

Qatar has reported 34,000 cases of the virus (more than 1 percent of the population), with 1,365 new ones just on Monday.

The UAE also announced late Monday that the night curfew would begin at 8 p.m. instead of 10 p.m., “in light of what we have observed during the holy month of Ramadan and the increase in the number of covid-19 infections resulting from some of the individuals in the community who were reckless and didn’t take into account the precautionary measures,” said Saif Juma al-Dhaheri of the Safety and Prevention Department.

Cases in the UAE have topped 24,000, more than twice the number before Ramadan began late last month. Dhaheri warned against family gatherings that could further spread the virus. The fasting period will end this weekend with the Eid al-Fitr holiday, which is normally celebrated with days of family visits and communal dinners.

Saudi Arabia and Kuwait have also experienced major jumps in the new numbers of cases over the weeks of Ramadan, and both have reimposed restrictions.

Starting on Eid al-Fitr, Saudi Arabia, the worst-hit country in the region after Iran, will return to a 24-hour lockdown. The kingdom reported 2,593 new cases Monday, for a total of more than 57,000.

In contrast, prayers at the al-Aqsa Mosque compound in Jerusalem will resume following the end of Ramadan festivities, as the virus’s spread there has slowed, the Council of the Islamic Waqf, the religious body that controls the site, said Tuesday."

What’s the explanation here? “New CDC Coronavirus Data Cuts American Death Toll Nearly In HALF” https://t.co/CyyDpI8Fll — Laura Ingraham (@IngrahamAngle) May 3, 2020

At this point, you can see the “edit” in the description of the linked article, an amendment added after the fact to acknowledge, to as small a degree as possible, that the premise of the article was entirely wrong. That was obvious in the moment, as The Washington Post’s Aaron Blake made clear.

AD

AD

What the article was insinuating was that the running total of covid-19 deaths compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was far smaller than what the media was reporting. At the time, the CDC listed about 37,000 deaths; media outlets were reporting something closer to 66,000. This was presented as the CDC having “cut” its estimate of the number of deaths from the virus — perhaps an acknowledgment that things weren’t as bad as they seemed.

But, again, this was nonsense.

Each day, the CDC publishes the number of deaths in a given week from covid-19. Many states and third-party aggregations of virus death tolls report the number of newly discovered deaths each day. If a hospital learns that a death the prior Thursday was a function of the virus, that death is included in the count for today, Tuesday. That’s not how the CDC does it. Instead, the CDC uses official confirmation of deaths from death certificates and ascribes deaths to the days on which they occur, meaning that Thursday’s death would be attributed to Thursday, even if we learned about it on Tuesday.

AD

AD

See where this is going? That means that last week’s numbers will go up more this week — and that the CDC’s numbers aren’t offered in real time. Comparing its total with compiled state reports’ total, in other words, is apples to oranges.

Now, two weeks after Ingraham’s elevation of this obviously wrong theory, we can show how wrong it was.

The article she linked to noted the disparity between the two lines below. The media was saying 66,000 deaths, but the CDC was under 40,000.

That total for the CDC used the department’s May 1 estimate. It releases a new estimate every weekday and, in each subsequent estimate, the numbers for the deaths in preceding weeks have increased as new deaths were reported to the federal government. Put visually, here’s how the CDC’s weekly estimate of deaths has increased over time.

It’s important to note that most prior weeks were adjusted upward as new deaths were reported. You might recall a few weeks ago when we learned that there had been deaths in California even before the first confirmed death in the United States. Those deaths were added to the CDC’s total for those weeks well after the fact.

The most recent estimate is from May 18. Here’s how the weekly death toll now compares with the data from May 1. Notice in particular the data from April 25, the most recent week for which data were available on May 1. In the last 17 days, the CDC’s estimated death toll that week has jumped by more than 8,000 cases — making up a big chunk of the “missing” deaths Ingraham was so worried about.

Looking at this cumulatively, you can see how the new estimate of total deaths compares with what was reported to the CDC on May 1. (The light-colored gray lines are the cumulative totals for each of the intervening estimates between May 1 and May 18.)

Note the May 2 figure, the closest end-of-week date to the article Ingraham linked. The May 18 estimate suggests that nearly 62,000 people had died by that date — a bit lower than the 66,000 attributed to the media at the time.

Again — and meaning no disrespect to my colleague Aaron Blake — this was not hard to figure out at the time. The CDC website itself indicated that the numbers were preliminary and would grow and, sure enough, they did.

For most people, absolutely, experts say. The outdoors may preserve your sanity — and save social distancing.

“If we don’t encourage people to get outside, we will have a widespread social insurrection,” said Jeanne Marrazzo, director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. “People are already challenged by the isolation imposed by social distancing.”

AD

Experts say that if you maintain a six-foot distance from other people, you should be even safer outside than in a closed area.

AD

When outdoors, “you don’t have to stay six feet away from your spouse or child,” said Maria Raven, chief of emergency medicine at the University of California at San Francisco. “But if you are meeting a friend for a hike or going to the grocery store, keep your distance.”

Dog walking is a good activity — as long as you don’t let your pet get too close to other dogs or other people. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there is no indication pets play a significant role in transmitting the virus, it recommends you treat them like family members, keeping them away from animals and people not in your household. Duke University researchers recently reported that Winston, a pug in North Carolina, tested positive for the virus — the first reported canine case in the United States. But the results still need to be confirmed.

AD

If you are a senior citizen or someone who is chronically ill or has a suppressed immune system, see if you can get prescriptions and groceries delivered, or send a younger relative to pick them up.

AD

If I’m older, do I have to stay inside all the time?

It’s hard to generalize, Marrazzo said, because “some 70-year-olds run marathons, so you can’t make a blanket statement about people’s risks.” But conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and diabetes raise people’s risks of becoming severely ill or dying of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. And even healthy seniors, she said, “don’t get a complete pass” on increased risk. The bottom line: All seniors should take extra care.

AD

What about masks? Should I wear one?

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that face coverings be worn in public places to slow spread of the virus, a reversal of previous recommendations.

The CDC’s website says the agency recommends the coverings for “public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g. grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.”

AD

Some businesses do not allow customers to enter without wearing masks.

The recommendation was announced in early April by President Trump, who stressed that the guidance was voluntary and said he wasn’t planning to wear a mask. The guidance was issued after a vigorous debate within the administration. Some officials wanted the recommendation targeted primarily to locales that are being especially affected by the virus.

But health officials argued that universal masking was necessary, pointing to new data showing that a high proportion of infected people may not exhibit symptoms, even as they spread the virus by emitting droplets when they talk, sneeze or even exhale. A mask — or some kind of cloth face covering, such as a bandanna or scarf — keeps those people from infecting others, they say.

AD

Health officials made clear that the public should avoid using the kind of gear — N95 respirators or surgical masks — that is in short supply and desperately needed by health workers.

What do I do if my significant other gets sick?

It depends. If you have been with the person day and night for several days, you may already be exposed. Still, you can’t know for sure, and doctors say it’s wise to err on the side of caution and distance yourself as much as possible.

AD

Most cases of covid-19 have mild or moderate symptoms, and a spouse probably will be able to take care of himself or herself. If possible, the ill spouse should move into an extra bedroom, use a different bathroom and wear a mask to protect others in the household.

If you are living with someone who needs help, you should wear a mask and gloves while providing care. If you are removing a dinner plate, for example, grab it with a dishrag or wear gloves, doctors say.

AD

Even at a distance, however, it’s important to monitor a person with covid-19. Doctors are finding that covid-19 can apparently raise the risks of blood clots, strokes and other serious conditions that require immediate medical care.

AD

What are the symptoms of covid-19?

A few months into the crisis, we know the disease has a far wider range of symptoms than initially thought. In addition to fever, coughing, shortness of breath and other flu-like symptoms, doctors are seeing gastrointestinal problems — nausea and vomiting, for example — chest pain and a loss of smell. Some doctors report brain inflammation and pinkeye in patients. It’s not clear, physicians say, whether the varied symptoms are caused by covid-19 or just occurring at the same time.

The CDC recently added several new symptoms to its list for the coronavirus, including chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and loss of taste and smell. The symptoms could appear two to 14 days after infection, the agency said.

AD

AD

What do I do if I think I’m infected?

Consult your primary care doctor, if you have one. Don’t go to the physician’s office or the emergency room without calling ahead. The coronavirus is highly contagious, and doctors want to protect themselves and other patients from infection. You’ll probably be advised to self-quarantine and, because there is no effective treatment for the disease, take over-the-counter pain medicines such as Tylenol.

If symptoms worsen, and you have trouble breathing or have underlying medical conditions, seek immediate medical care.

Will I be tested for the virus?

It depends on where you live and even what hospital or health system you use. After a sluggish start, diagnostic testing is ramping up in many parts of the country, helped by the entry of commercial labs and the approval of rapid tests by the Food and Drug Administration.

AD

AD

But in some states, laboratories are still overwhelmed by the demand and struggling with shortages of critical items, including chemical components needed to run the tests.

Governors, congressional leaders and public health officials have pressed for a robust testing plan from the federal government, insisting that frequent and widespread testing is crucial to ending the stay-at-home orders that have idled businesses in much of the country. But a “blueprint” presented Monday by Trump leaves the onus on states to develop their own plans and rapid-response programs.

The United States has run more tests than any other country but trails many nations in per capita testing.

What about home tests?

The FDA has not approved any tests in which the entire process — collection of nasal specimen, followed by processing and result — occur at home. But it did give emergency authorization for a test that allows patients to collect nasal samples at home. The idea is for consumers to go online and fill out a questionnaire with LabCorp, a North Carolina company. If they meet CDC guidelines for testing, they’ll be sent the Pixel kit that includes swabs and saline. Once patients collect the specimens, they can mail them to a LabCorp lab for processing.

AD

LabCorp said it would initially make the test available only to health-care workers and emergency workers showing covid-19 symptoms. The company plans to make the test available to consumers in coming weeks. Allowing people to self-swab reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to others and the need for personal protective equipment, because health-care providers are not involved in sample collection, the company said.

What about antibody tests?

One of the hottest topics now is serology tests, designed to detect whether you have been exposed to the virus and have antibodies that may help show whether you have immunity to the illness. They are not designed to detect active infections.

Dozens of antibody tests are on the market, but the FDA has authorized fewer than 10. The agency has taken a hands-off approach, allowing companies to sell the test after notifying the FDA and saying the tests have been validated. At the same time, the agency and testing experts have warned that some of the tests are being marketed fraudulently and are of dubious quality. The government is trying to validate the unvetted tests, but it is unclear when the data will be available.

Even authorized tests have come in for scrutiny. Some government and business officials tout them as a way to reopen the economy by identifying people who can safely return to work. But many scientists, as well as the World Health Organization, say evidence is lacking that even high-quality antibody tests can prove someone who was infected has immunity from the novel coronavirus and is not at risk of being reinfected.

When will this end?

No one knows, though experts say the social distancing practiced by many Americans has prevented the pandemic from being worse. It isn’t clear how the arrival of summer’s warmer weather will affect the virus.

The White House is finalizing expanded guidelines to allow the phased reopening of schools and camps, child-care programs, certain workplaces, houses of worship, restaurants and mass transit, according to documents under review by administration officials.

Several states are lifting, or considering lifting, strict stay-at-home orders to allow some businesses to reopen. Colorado, Georgia and Texas are among those pressing ahead. Even New York, which was hit especially hard, is exploring a loosening of the rules. But public health officials warn state leaders to proceed carefully and to be prepared to reinstate tough regulations if the number of virus cases surges. Experts say any successful reopening strategy must be accompanied by additional testing and contact tracing to quickly find and isolate people who contract the virus.

Even after Americans emerge from their isolation, chances are good we will have to maintain some measures — isolating the infected, regular hand-washing, some degree of social distancing — until viable treatments and vaccines are developed, which could take months or years.

In about 15 seconds, it calculates how much oxygen is being transported through the person’s bloodstream and displays the results as a percentage (abbreviated SpO₂). Doctors consider a SpO₂ reading of 94 percent and higher to be normal. Low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxemia) can lead to low levels of oxygen in the tissue and organs (hypoxia), which can lead to death.

Pulse oximeters are usually purchased for home use by people who want or need to monitor their oxygen supply, including patients with chronic lung conditions such as COPD, performance athletes or people living at high altitude. Shortly after the pandemic began, however, the easy-to-use devices started being touted as a means to detect serious complications from covid-19, the disease the virus causes.

“The reason there is such great interest pulse oximeters now is that covid-19 has a fairly significant effect on the body’s ability to oxygenate, sometimes discordant with how the patient feels,” says Benjamin Seides, director of interventional pulmonology at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield, Ill., outside Chicago. Though patients aren’t especially short of breath, their low blood oxygen levels may indicate they are headed for a crisis.

Seides said an idea started to spread: Maybe if physicians told people to watch their blood oxygen levels, they could contact a doctor or go to the emergency room if their saturation levels dramatically dipped. That prompted a run on the devices.

Sales data provided to The Washington Post from Bloomreach, an e-commerce software firm, shows that U.S. sales of fingertip pulse oximeters increased by 506 percent over the previous week during the week of Feb. 17 and 168 percent over that week during the week of Feb. 24. Since that time, demand held fairly steady and then tapered off the first two weeks of April. But in recent weeks, sales again have started to climb, perhaps as consumers prepare for the next phase of living with the pandemic. In mid-May, the devices were still sold out, delayed or on back order in stores such as Walgreens, CVS and Target.

AD

Medical-grade pulse oximeters cost $200 or more, but consumers can find them for about $50 at pharmacies, big-box stores and online. Even the lower-cost versions are considered a fast and reliable way to measure how well you are oxygenating.

Correct usage is key to a trustworthy reading, however, which can fluctuate based on a number of factors — what you are doing physically (sitting versus running), proper device placement and the altitude you live at. Artificial nails and nail polish, especially gel-based, can produce inaccurate measurements of SpO₂, as they block the light transmission. Cold hands or poor circulation can also interfere with the light and produce false numbers, because pulse oximeters need a steady flow of blood beneath the sensor.

Pulmonologist Federico Cerrone, managing physician at Overlook Medical Center in Summit, N.J., says people with chronic health issues may want to get a pulse oximeter at this time because it can be a helpful tool for regularly checking in with a doctor via telemedicine. Patients with covid-19 who are discharged from a hospital also may be given a pulse oximeter so they can monitor their numbers to see if they are improving or getting worse.

AD

AD

“It can be a reassurance or a harbinger of issues indicating you may need to return to the hospital,” Cerrone says.

Unless you have an underlying condition or are recovering from covid-19, however, you probably don’t need to add one to your collection of home health supplies.

“It’s a convenience, not a necessity. If you are short of breath or have a cough, you can usually call your physician and have a drive-through check of your oxygenation,” says Cerrone.

He also cautions against the use of oximeter apps that purport to tell you various medical readings because their performance has not been validated in scientific studies. A recent University of Oxford study found no evidence that any smartphone technology is accurate for the measurement of blood oxygen saturation. In fact, the study states, “oxygen saturation levels obtained from such technologies should not be trusted.”

AD

AD

There are potential drawbacks to widespread usage of pulse oximeters. Seides says that some patients who possess them become compulsive and check their saturation levels too often. “In the hands of nervous patients, the device creates anxiety and confusion without much probative value, because even with a small dip in readings they call their physician. It’s important to recognize that a pulse oximeter is a single data point of a complete picture.”

Another concern is that those who use a pulse oximeter as a covid-19 litmus test may ignore other troubling signs.

“I worry that though their saturation numbers look okay, people with other symptoms such a shortness of breath or persistent cough won’t seek medical attention,” says Seides.

AD

Physicians agree that during this pandemic, the important actions remain physical distancing, washing hands, wearing a mask, listening to public health officials and, if you’re not feeling well, calling your doctor."

How to support restaurants, cafes and bars that have closed

Many eateries have been forced to reduce or close operations due to the outbreak. If you want to support your local restaurant, consider ordering takeout or purchasing a gift card or merchandise.

“Gift cards are like interest-free loans,” San Antonio restaurant owner Steve McHugh told The Washington Post. Having some income from the gift cards could help a restaurant get back up and running again, says Edouardo Jordan, a James Beard-award-winning chef.

You also may consider supporting servers and other workers who have been laid off by donating to a fund or nonprofit, such as the Restaurant Workers’ Community Foundation, mentioned above. Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, a nonprofit organization serving restaurant workers, recently launched a campaign to raise $500,000 for a disaster relief fund. You can also look for workers relief funds that may have been set up in your area.

How to help seniors who are at risk

Older people are among the most vulnerable to complications from coronavirus. If you know someone who is elderly and at home, consider checking in and asking if you can help shop and deliver groceries on their behalf.

If you have a loved one who lives in a facility, respect rules the facility may have in place, including barring visitors. Deborah Dunn, president of the Gerontological Advanced Practice Nurses Association, says a lockdown is standard protocol for many facilities during flu season and can help shield residents from potential exposure.

How to help ‘flatten the curve’

One of the most important things you can do to help is protect yourself and others. Prevent the spread of the illness by practicing the CDC’s recommended guidance: Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after being in a public area or after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing. Don’t forget to moisturize.

If there has been a coronavirus case in your community, practice social distancing and avoid large gatherings and close contact with others. Yes, social distancing is difficult — and against our very nature — but it can be crucial to “flattening the curve” and slowing transmission of the virus. There are reasons the CDC recommended a nationwide halt to gatherings of 50 people or more and a federal coronavirus task force recommended no gatherings of more than 10. Local governments are canceling large events and ordering restaurants and bars to stop on-site services. These are all efforts to prevent an onslaught of ill people from overwhelming the limited resources of the health-care system.

“The idea is that the sooner you stop that transmission chain, you are actually limiting an exponential growth,” Yvonne Maldonado, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at Stanford University, told The Post. “That’s really important, because instead of preventing 1,000 cases, you might be preventing 100,000 cases — and a matter of days can make a difference.”

The CDC also recommends wearing face coverings in public, especially in places where social distancing may be difficult, such as in grocery stores, and areas with high rates of community transition. Here’s a guide on how to sew your own fabric mask. Just remember that social distancing still remains an important preventive measure.

How to help at stores

Public health officials have stated this over and over: Please do not buy an N-95 respirator or surgical mask unless you absolutely need it. Widespread panic-buying can deplete the supply of protective equipment needed for health-care workers. Because of mask shortages, groups have created websites with crowdsourced suggestions on how to donate unused protective equipment to hospitals or medical centers.

Similarly, be mindful about how many groceries you buy. If you can afford to, buy enough for at least two to three weeks but don’t take everything off the shelves. If you are older, have chronic health conditions or otherwise at higher risk for complications from the virus, consider having someone else shop for you or getting groceries delivered.

“Because everybody is panicking, there are a lot of people in the grocery stores, so if you belong in that group of people who are 65 or older, or immune compromised, then it is best to get someone else to shop for you, if you can,” said Bettina Fries, chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases at Stony Brook University in New York.

Some grocery stores have offered limited hours for those who are older.

How to help pets and shelters

Local animal shelters and rescue groups across the country are reducing services and canceling fundraisers to protect staff but still need to care for their animals. The Humane Society of the United States suggests helping by adopting or fostering a pet, which will reduce the strain on shelters. The Best Friends Animal Society has a site where you can search for partner organizations near you.

Some shelters also offer pet support services for low-wage families who may not be able to afford caring for their pet. Check with your local shelter to see if there are ways you can donate or help.

The Humane Rescue Alliance suggests checking in with people in your community, especially seniors or those with underlying health issues, and offering to walk their dogs or help with pet food.

It’s not for the ‘morbidly obese,’ says Pelosi.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/KDOQXVUZWUI6VFKDET3TSLOK5Y.jpg&w=1440,"But those dire warnings appear to have done little to change the president’s opinion. On Monday, toward the end of a roundtable event with restaurant industry executives at the White House, Trump offered his strongest endorsement of the drug to date.

AD

“I’m taking it — hydroxychloroquine,” Trump said. “Right now.”

He later told reporters: “I was just waiting to see your eyes light up when I said this … you know, when I announced this. But, yeah, I have taken it for about a week and a half now, and I’m still here. I’m still here.”

AD

Trump’s announcement that he has been taking the drug in combination with zinc for about 10 days as a preventive measure against the novel virus prompted numerous questions, reactions and concerns, including an unflattering suggestion from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) that the president shouldn’t be using the medicine because he is “morbidly obese.”

“He’s our president, and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists,” Pelosi said on CNN in a now-viral clip, “especially in his age group, and in his, shall we say, weight group: ‘Morbidly obese,’ they say.”

“I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group, and in his, shall we say, weight group: ‘Morbidly obese,’ they say,” says House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Pres. Trump’s revelation he is taking hydroxychloroquine. pic.twitter.com/0ImjpEjg9q — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) May 19, 2020

It all began Monday with a question about whistleblowers, which prompted Trump to launch into a lengthy tirade that started with Ukraine and impeachment before turning to the most recent whistleblower to draw his anger: former top vaccine official Rick Bright.

AD

“See whether or not he was a big contributor to the Democrats. See whether or not he wanted the Democrats to win,” Trump told reporters, referring to Bright. “There’s a lot of bad things coming out about him, but you people don’t want to write the news.”

Trump appeared to be angered by Bright’s comments from a “60 Minutes” segment that aired Sunday. In the interview, Bright, who claims he was retaliated against last month for raising concerns about hydroxychloroquine, continued his criticism of the federal government’s handling of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, calling the response slow and chaotic.

AD

On Monday, Trump pointed out it was Bright who had signed a request to the Food and Drug Administration to issue an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat covid-19.

“Now, if he doesn’t believe in it, why would he sign it?” Trump said, before abruptly pivoting to his startling revelation.

AD

“A lot of good things have come out about the hydroxy. A lot of good things have come out,” Trump continued. “You’d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the front-line workers, before you catch it. The front-line workers, many, many are taking it.”

Then, the president revealed front-line workers are not the only group of people taking the drug to protect against the virus. He is, too.

AD

Following a brief pause as reporters digested the news, multiple voices rang out all at once with the same follow-up question: “You’re taking hydroxychloroquine?”

Trump’s claim unleashed a torrent of queries from the journalists in the room — and number of the same questions were repeatedly raised throughout the night as politicians, medical professionals and the general public were left puzzled over the president’s decision.

AD

Chief among the questions that emerged Monday was “why?” Why would the president start taking a drug that experts say has no proven ability to protect against covid-19 and also has potentially deadly side effects?

“Because I think it’s good,” Trump said.

Up against the weight of scientific opinion, he offered “a lot of good stories” that he has heard about it. “And if it’s not good, I’ll tell you. … I’m not going to get hurt by it. It’s been around for 40 years for malaria, for lupus, for other things.”

Trump again claimed front-line workers and “a lot of doctors” take hydroxychloroquine, but he provided no details. He also repeatedly cited letters and calls he said he has received from people heralding the drug’s effects, often referring to one note from an unnamed doctor near Westchester, N.Y.

AD

“He just said, ‘Sir, I have hundreds of patients and I give them hydroxychloroquine; I give them the Z-Pak, which is azithromycin; and I give them zinc,’ ” Trump said, appearing to quote the letter from memory. “ ‘And out of the hundreds of patients — many hundreds, over 300 patients — I haven’t lost one.’ ”

AD

The reporters, however, kept pressing.

“Did the White House doctor recommend that you take that? Is that why you’re taking it?” one asked.

“No, I asked him, ‘What do you think?’ ” Trump said, recalling the conversation with the White House physician. “He said, ‘Well, if you’d like it.’ I said, ‘Yeah, I’d like it. I’d like to take it.’ ”

Later Monday, the White House released a letter from Sean P. Conley, Trump’s in-house physician, that confirmed he had spoken with the president about the drug.

AD

“After numerous discussions he and I had for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks,” Conley wrote.

AD

But the letter did not specify whether Conley had written Trump a prescription for hydroxychloroquine or if the president is actually taking “a pill every day,” as he said during Monday’s event.

“I’m taking the two: the zinc and the hydroxy,” Trump said. “And all I can tell you is, so far, I seem to be okay.”

One reporter went on to inquire about another possibility for Trump’s decision to start the regimen, given recent news that at least two people in the White House, including a personal valet to the president, have tested positive for coronavirus.

“Have you been exposed?” the reporter asked.

“No, not at all,” Trump responded, later stressing he has “zero symptoms” and has consistently negative test results.

As Trump continued touting the drug, it didn’t take long for someone to ask, “What is the evidence that it has a preventive effect?”

“Here we go, you ready? Here’s my evidence,” the president said, spreading his hands wide. “I get a lot of positive calls about it.”

Trump noted that the “only negative” feedback he has heard about the drug comes from an analysis done by academic researchers that examined the medical records of 368 male patients at Veterans Affairs hospitals nationwide and found the drug was linked to higher rates of death for those hospitalized with the coronavirus. According to the April study, more than 27 percent of patients who received hydroxychloroquine died, and 22 percent of patients who were treated with a combination of the drug and the antibiotic azithromycin also died. In comparison, the death rate for those who did not receive the drugs was 11.4 percent.

AD

“The only negative I’ve heard was the study where they gave it — was it the VA? With, you know, people that aren’t big Trump fans gave it,” Trump said, adding, “It was a very unscientific report, by the way. But I get a lot of tremendously positive news on the hydroxy. And I say, ‘Hey.’ You know the expression I’ve used …? ‘What do you have to lose?’ Okay? ‘What do you have to lose?’ ”

Medical experts quickly rejected Trump’s dismissal of safety concerns.

“There is NO evidence for [hydroxychloroquine] being effective in treatment of #covid19 or prophylaxis to prevent the disease,” tweeted Leana S. Wen, former Baltimore city health commissioner and a contributing columnist to The Washington Post. “This is a medication that has serious side effects.”

There is NO evidence for hydrochloroquine being effective in treatment of #covid19 or prophylaxis to prevent the disease. This is a medication that has serious side effects. I am very concerned about @realDonaldTrump continuing to model behavior that could harm many Americans. — Leana Wen, M.D. (@DrLeanaWen) May 18, 2020

In an appearance on CNN, Sanjay Gupta, the network’s chief medical correspondent, said Trump “shouldn’t be taking” the drug.

“His own FDA has said that this is still something under investigation that should not be taken outside of a clinical trial,” Gupta said. “Only hospitalized patients should be getting it.”

While Gupta acknowledged Trump was right in saying the drug has been used to prevent malaria for decades, its use in people who already have coronavirus poses “some real concerns.”

Aside from the medical community, Trump’s comments also struck a nerve with a number of cable news personalities, most notably Fox News’s Neil Cavuto.

“If you are in a risky population here and you are taking this as a preventive treatment to ward off the virus, or in a worst-case scenario, you are dealing with the virus and you are in this vulnerable population, it will kill you,” Cavuto said during his Monday show. “I cannot stress enough: This will kill you.”

“Whatever benefits the president says this has, and certainly it has had for those suffering from malaria, dealing with lupus, this is a leap that should not be taken casually by those watching at home or assuming, well, the president of the United States says it’s okay,” Cavuto added. “Not to make a political point here, but a life and death point. Be very, very careful.”"

AD

A Texas barbecue restaurant reopened only after hiring for a new job category: a bathroom monitor, who assures that people waiting their turn are spaced well apart. In Florida, malls are installing touch-free sinks and hand dryers in restrooms before opening their doors. McDonald’s is requiring franchisees to clean bathrooms every 30 minutes. Across the country, businesses are replacing blow dryers with paper towels, decommissioning urinals that now seem too close together, and removing restroom doors to create airport-style, no-touch entrances.

AD

In San Luis Obispo, Calif., the Sunset Drive-In held back from reopening even though the health department gave it the green light because the owner needed time to figure out how to address customers’ concerns about catching the novel coronavirus in the bathroom.

“Before we open, we want to have the restroom problem solved for your safety,” the owner, Larry Rodkey, wrote on Facebook. “Sitting through approximately five hours of movies is a necessity for the enjoyment of the Drive-In.”

The theater reopened over the weekend with extra employees to disinfect the bathrooms every 30 minutes and limits on queuing up.

The Aut-O-Rama Twin Drive-In theater in North Ridgeville, Ohio, reopened this week with 10 portable toilets added to the eight existing stalls, even though movie attendance was limited to 25 percent of the usual capacity. On its marquee facing the highway, the theater touted the advantages of outdoor, in-car movie watching: “Social Distancing Since 1965.”

AD

Owner Deb Sherman has instituted new policies, leaving plenty of space between cars, requiring masks and enforcing six-foot distancing in the restrooms.

“Anyone not following established safe policies set forth may be asked to leave the theatre without a refund,” the policy reads.

She doubled her staff from 10 to 20 to keep queues to a minimum and let customers see that someone was constantly disinfecting the restrooms and concessions stand.

“If we can give them some confidence about safety, people are ready to get out of the house and try and have a little more normal life,” she said. “The restroom situation didn’t bother me personally, but it was the number one concern people had on our Facebook page, so I had to take action to make them comfortable.”

AD

Such comfort might be hard-won. Laura Maxwell is eager to find an entertainment option that would let her take her children, ages 11 and 13, out of the house safely. Maxwell, who lives in San Luis Obispo, would happily return to the Sunset Drive-In, but the prospect of restroom queues is bothersome.

AD

“Bathrooms are a problem,” she said. “They’re huge contact places, and if you’re shedding the virus, it’ll be all over. Maybe they could just open up without bathrooms and people would know in advance and make the decision not to go, or to wear Depends.”

Solutions to people’s anxieties might not be quite so simple, said Steven Soifer, president of the American Restroom Association, which advocates for safer and more private public bathrooms.

AD

“Americans have always had a fear of contamination from public restrooms,” said Soifer, who also is a professor of social work at the University of Mississippi. “What we’re seeing now is part just heightened anxiety, but it’s also part reality-based. Public restrooms in this country generally have open toilet seats — no lids — and high-pressure flushes create a plume of droplets that extends at least six feet.”

The coronavirus has been found in human waste up to a month after a victim has recovered. And a study published last week concluded that droplets from human speaking can hang in the air for at least eight minutes.

Soifer’s group seeks a retooling of public facilities that would place toilets inside fully enclosed unisex stalls, as is more common in Europe and parts of Asia. There would be larger dividers separating urinals.

AD

“In our country, people aren’t comfortable talking about bathroom issues in general,” Soifer said. “The old frontier mentality and the emphasis on personal liberty has led to an attitude where there’s no standard for public restrooms other than the building code. Now we need to extend social distancing to restrooms, and it’s going to be very hard. Even if you limit the number of stalls, you then create a line of people outside.”

Makers of bathroom fixtures have seen a surge of restaurant owners and workplace managers ordering thorough renovations of their bathrooms — a level of attention unusual in a country where many public restrooms haven’t moved much higher up the design ladder than the stereotypically awful gas station bathroom.

“People are converting to fixtures with touchless features,” said Jon Dommisse, director of strategy for Bradley Corp., a Wisconsin-based maker of workplace washroom equipment. “They’re swapping out faucets, dryers, anything with buttons, levers, knobs. They’re reducing the number of people allowed in at a time, taking doors off and adding wash stations outside the bathroom to relieve crowding. Most of all, we’re seeing a commitment to almost relentless levels of cleaning.”

Bradley regularly conducts national surveys about bathrooms, and even in good times, 76 percent of Americans say they’ve had memorably bad experiences in public restrooms. The latest survey, conducted last month, found that 91 percent of consumers want touchless fixtures in bathrooms, Dommisse said, “a number we’ve never seen before.”

Going away: Push-button soap dispensers, and those high-velocity hand dryers that can blow germs across an entire room. Coming to a restroom near you: More copper fixtures — copper has antimicrobial properties — and dryers integrated into the sink so no one walks across the room dripping water.

“Maybe the multi-stall restroom is obsolete,” said Michelle Kempen, an interior designer at Kahler Slater, an architecture firm in Milwaukee. “With covid, we’re moving toward a more European model, where the WC is a single room and then you go out into a shared sink area, along with touchless design and maybe a return to restroom attendants.”

Having an employee present at all times, she said, makes cleaning ongoing and evident.

But employees cost money, and the bill for retooling a restroom can be $25,000 or more — McDonald’s is leaving it to franchise owners to foot the bill for $718 touchless sinks and $310 sensor-activated towel dispensers. Quick fixes are likely to be cheaper, such as a return to paper towels, additional signage and one-way foot traffic.

Some businesses now want cleaning done by day rather than when they’re closed so customers and employees can see the company taking cleaning seriously, said Michelle Goret, a spokeswoman for Cintas, an Ohio-based supplier of restroom services.

AD

AD

“To further ease consumer anxiety around restrooms, our customers are also more interested in providing proof of service,” Goret said. “We’ve even had some customers film our technicians performing a deep clean to share with their customers and employees.”

Figuring out what might restore consumer confidence is more art than science. In a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll this month, 78 percent said they would be uncomfortable eating at a sit-down restaurant. The results were similar whether people lived in a state that is opening up businesses or one still operating under tight restrictions.

In South Florida, where many stores are reopening, the Bal Harbour Shops mall hired 14 extra people to clean. Restaurants will move their seating outdoors, but customers still need to go inside to use the restrooms, which are being renovated to include automatic doors, touchless sinks and dryers.

In Milwaukee, at Good City Brewing’s two locations, owner David Dupee plans to “control the number of people and mark off space where people should stand while they’re waiting for the restroom — whatever we can do to make people feel comfortable that guests around them will be appropriately distant. But we don’t expect any return to normalcy until there’s a vaccine. We’ve all been trained in recent weeks to walk across the street when we see other people on the sidewalk. That’s just in our psyche now.”

Outdoor venues might seem to be the easiest to reopen, but whether they are sports stadiums, concert facilities or parks, visitors still eventually need to go — a packed event and beer and soda sales inevitably lead to crowded bathrooms and long lines — so managers of such spaces are focusing on how to provide relief.

The American Hiking Society has recommended that people limit their walks to places in their neighborhoods, in part to avoid having to stop to answer nature’s call. Bathrooms at many parks and beaches are closed, and those that are open struggle with staffing and with maintaining a supply of toilet paper, which remains difficult to find in many places.

Some mayors have even talked about hiring guards to assure that toilet paper doesn’t walk off the premises.

All beach restrooms remain closed in Emerald Isle, N.C., but the Outer Banks town is taking bids from private services to clean bathrooms every 90 minutes and disinfect them every night once they reopen, probably in late May.

Town Manager Matt Zapp said the added measures will cost $250 per cleaning for each of the three public restrooms, as well as the town’s fire, police and EMS stations.

AD

Although beach crowds so far have been “substantially less than normal,” Zapp said, “public demand to return to ‘life as we knew it’ is increasing weekly.”

The closing of many public facilities already has posed a considerable hardship to essential workers such as delivery drivers and police and to homeless people, who say the lack of access to toilets in stores, restaurants and even fire stations has made it difficult to get through the day.

Truckers and food delivery drivers have filled social media with accounts of their fruitless search for open restrooms at their usual stops. Some restaurants now limiting their business to takeout service are barring delivery drivers from their bathrooms, erecting walls of tables and chairs to keep people out.

Some cities have put portable toilets on streets to serve homeless people who previously depended on restrooms in public libraries, community centers and fast-food restaurants.

Seattle opened six hand-washing stations and 14 portable toilets near homeless encampments, and San Francisco is staffing public bathrooms at 49 locations where homeless people congregate.

Even police officers are having trouble finding a place to go during their shifts. Coffee shops are closed, and fire stations formerly hospitable to other first responders are taking a newly cautious approach.

In Manchester, Maine, the fire station restroom was closed to the state and county cops who usually pop in. “No law enforcement,” said the sign on the door.

“We have a small, volunteer fire department, and it would be devastated if we lost a couple of guys who had to quarantine,” said Robert Gasper, who is chairman of the town board of selectmen and a captain in the fire department. “Volunteerism is down across the country, so we can’t afford to take a chance.”

Such uncertainty is likely to remain as people decide when to resume going out, and part of the calculus will be whether they can make it comfortably through a day.

“The new normal is going to be traveling with your own toiletries,” said Sonia Massey, who, with her husband, Bill, developed the Restroom Kit, a packet the size of a deck of cards that includes a toilet seat cover, three feet of toilet paper, and sanitary wipes. They also sell hand sanitizer in misters and gel bottles.

The Masseys, who live in Clinton, Md., have seen sales surge for their five-year-old product — a sign, they say, that people who feel they’ve lost control are eager to take charge of at least life’s most intimate aspects."

Americans, though, don’t seem to be crediting Trump nearly as much as he would like.

New polling data from SurveyMonkey, which were shared with The Washington Post, show that fully 49 of 50 governors have significantly higher approval ratings for their coronavirus responses than Trump does in recent polls. A Washington Post-Ipsos poll last week showed 43 percent of Americans approved of Trump’s handling of the outbreak.

AD

AD

The one governor on Trump’s level is Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R), whose efforts to reopen his state have proved controversial. In the Post-Ipsos poll, Kemp’s approval rating was 39 percent; in the new one, it’s a similar 43 percent — the same as Trump’s.

Apart from Kemp, the governor closest to Trump is Hawaii Gov. David Ige (D), at 54 percent. No other governor falls below half of their constituents supporting their response.

Here’s the full list:

The data show Democratic governors with an average coronavirus approval rating of 69 percent, while Republican governors are at 67 percent.

But interestingly, most of the highest and lowest approval ratings belong to Republicans.

AD

Among the highest are a trio of moderate Republicans who have distanced themselves from Trump — Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) at 85 percent, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott (R) at 82 percent, and Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker (R) at 82 percent. They occupy three of the top five slots, and six of the top seven are Republicans.

AD

Hogan has clashed with Trump over the availability of testing and has criticized some of the president’s comments. Baker’s restrictive measures on businesses have drawn rebukes from his own state party chairman, who appears to side with Trump’s push to reopen the economy. The trio also supported the impeachment inquiry into Trump last year.

Interestingly, all three have significantly more support from Democratic-leaning voters than Republicans, with at least 9 in 10 giving each governor a thumbs-up. Scott is at a particularly remarkable 97 percent support among these Democratic-leaning voters. Among Republican-leaning voters, he’s at 66 percent, while Hogan is at 77 percent and Baker is at 69 percent.

AD

The same reversal is true of the other Republican governors ranking in the top seven, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) is at 82 percent overall, including 86 percent among Democratic-leaning voters and 70 percent among Republican-leaning ones. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) is at 80 percent overall, including 92 percent among Democratic leaners and 74 percent among Republican leaners.

AD

On the other end of the scale, though, are many of their fellow GOPers. Of the 11 governors with the lowest approval ratings on coronavirus, nine are Republicans.

Along with Kemp, they including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) at 58 percent. Both governors, like Kemp, have pushed forward with among the most aggressive reopening plans.

AD

Also among the 11 at the lowest end are four Republican governors of Midwestern states — Iowa’s Kim Reynolds, South Dakota’s Kristi L. Noem, Missouri’s Mike Parson and Nebraska’s Pete Ricketts — all at 58 percent. All four were among the latest holdouts on issuing statewide stay-at-home orders or were among the few to never issue them at all.

The only other Democrat to rank among the lowest 11 besides Ige is Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers (D), at 60 percent.

AD

The numbers reinforce the rallying effect the coronavirus outbreak has created among the American people -- at least when it comes to their governors. They also suggest a more steady, competent response from the federal government might have carried significant upside for Trump; instead, he’s stuck at where he almost always has been in polling of his performance: the low-to-mid 40s.

As the virus has continued to spread, experts and more casual observers have tracked daily numbers to evaluate the progress being made. Seeing a gap in data on daily testing, a group of volunteers established a project to compile individual state reports. Dashboards like the one created by researchers from Johns Hopkins University became go-to destinations for information about the virus’s spread. More sophisticated users tracked the reproduction number for the virus by state, a measure of its effective contagiousness. And when the Trump administration decided to encourage a scaling back of the containment measures, which had left a number of businesses closed, it established numeric benchmarks that states were supposed to meet before doing so.

AD

AD

When numbers and politics overlap, though, tension often emerges. If facts are stubborn things, numbers are nearly immobile — but not irreplaceable. In recent weeks, we have seen a number of occasions when the numbers related to the coronavirus pandemic have been misrepresented, altered or made a focus of efforts at reinterpretation as the inertia of political motivation has pushed against mathematical reality.

On Monday evening, Florida Today reported that the head of the Florida Department of Health’s data team claimed to have been forced from her position earlier this month. Rebekah Jones helped create a localized dashboard of coronavirus information used to track the spread of the virus in the state. A few weeks ago, though, control over the information was taken away from the department.

In a farewell note, Jones offered a word of caution about the data still being presented on the site.

AD

AD

“I would not expect the new team to continue the same level of accessibility and transparency that I made central to the process during the first two months,” Jones wrote. “After all, my commitment to both is largely (arguably entirely) the reason I am no longer managing it.”

Once the White House gave the green light for states to scale back distancing measures at the end of April, Florida quickly moved forward with doing so. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), a strong Trump ally, announced that the state would begin to reopen on May 4 — one day before Jones was removed from her position. The state did not reply to questions from Florida Today about the change in management of the data.

In Georgia, a different data-based kerfuffle emerged late last week. The state, which moved even more rapidly than Florida to scale back social distancing measures, has been a subject of scrutiny about whether it moved too quickly. So far, neither Georgia nor Florida has seen a significant increase in new infections — but things have not gone quite as well as one graph from the state’s Department of Public Health made it seem.

AD

AD

Political reporter Stephen Fowler noticed an anomaly in the graph showing a consistent downward trend in new cases in several large counties. That trend was a function of the data being shown out of order — May 1 was followed by April 30, which was followed by May 6, for example. The state claimed it had made a mistake, seeking to show data in a more readable way, without success. As Fowler noted, this wasn’t the primary graph detailing the spread of the virus on the site, bolstering the idea that it was simply a mistake, albeit a mistake that, at first glance, bolstered Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s decision to reopen Georgia.

As the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported, though, this was only one of a number of data mistakes or changes made by the state government. To some extent, this is a natural function of the fluid, shifting pandemic. It nonetheless raises questions about the validity of the numbers being used to evaluate Georgia’s progress and introduces the possibility of outside influence.

Trump and his allies are certainly aware of the focus on the numbers undergirding the pandemic. The president has consistently focused on the number of new cases of coronavirus and the death toll from covid-19, the disease it causes, as measures of his administration’s success. At times, he has been explicit about his efforts to keep the numbers from being inflated, as when he said at the beginning of March that he preferred to keep passengers on a ship anchored near San Francisco to prevent the number of cases in the United States from spiking.

AD

AD

Earlier this month, Axios reported on a different effort by the administration to tweak the numbers. Worried about a continually increasing death toll from the virus, Trump — echoing voices on Fox News and in the conservative media — argued that the totals were being overcounted. In reality, the death toll is almost certainly being significantly undercounted, but that is far less politically useful to a president seeking reelection in November.

Again, there is a natural uncertainty to a number of these metrics, offering cover to efforts to shape what they say. In Nebraska, counts of new infections at meatpacking plants were climbing quickly — until the state stopped reporting the numbers. Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) argued that some of those who had been infected were misreporting their places of employment, making the numbers seem worse than they were. Public pressure eventually helped prompt the companies to release information about new infections.

Nationally, the data show that the number of new cases each day and the number of deaths from covid-19 have each declined. That’s obviously good news and bolsters the idea that the nation can cautiously begin relaxing some containment efforts. The question that arises, however, is whether states and the federal government will respond if those cases begin to rapidly increase again. Will there be a new push for social distancing rules?

And even that channel isn’t available to everyone.

Pakistan already struggles to keep millions of children in school, and as partial shutdowns continue, educators warn enrollments could drop further. Some private-school students were given study plans and extra coursework, but most Pakistani children — those who attend public government schools — were sent home with no further guidance.

“They said, ‘Keep them busy,’ but they didn’t provide us an outline to study, anything,” said Kainat Nisar, a 24-year-old university student who suddenly found herself in charge of the education of five nieces and nephews between the ages of 4 and 14.

The children watch the government channel for their allotted hour, but Nisar, as one of the most educated people in her family, is left to keep everyone engaged for the rest of the day. A typical day has the younger children outside on the roof hunched over workbooks while the older children share use of the family’s only laptop in a back room.

""You are teaching your children on your own; you're on your own,"" she said.

Pakistan has some of the world’s worst education indicators. More than 40 percent of Pakistan’s school-age students don’t attend school, the second-highest rate in the world. And even for those who do attend school, literacy rates suggest many are not learning. Fewer than 20 percent of Pakistani third-graders can read and comprehend a short passage.

Now, educators, experts and officials fear the months-long closure of schools in Pakistan with minimal distance learning is set to exacerbate the problem.

The national Pakistani curriculum is taught in Urdu and English — the country’s official languages. But most Pakistani children grow up speaking a regional language at home and struggle to absorb information in the classroom. Lessons largely consist of rote memorization with teachers reciting the content of textbooks to classes of 30 to 40 children. The students chant back what the teachers just said.

AD

""It's almost like we think kids are USB sticks, and we are just downloading this information onto them and that will make them educated,"" said Nadia Naviwala, a global fellow at the Wilson Center and an expert on the Pakistani education system. She warns Pakistan's education crisis is preventing the country from advancing economically and undercuts efforts to battle extremism.

These larger problems in Pakistan's education system, Naviwala says, are reflected in the government television channel created during the coronavirus pandemic.

The Teleschool channel is uneven in its quality. Some programming is incomprehensible and fast-paced, while other broadcasts are better than the content children get in the government school system, according to education experts.

AD

In one recently broadcast English lesson for kindergartners about the letter “u,” a young female voice narrates an animated story about a village of huts destroyed by a mudslide after a greedy man cut down all the trees. As the story is told, the words “hut,” “mud” and “cut” flashed on the screen.

AD

But during another broadcast, a second-grade science lesson on the eyesight of owls delved into how unique proteins in the birds’ eyes sense different light wavelengths, subject matter far beyond the comprehension level of a second-grader.

Pakistan’s education minister, Shafqat Mahmood, acknowledges problems with the content. “We know it’s not perfect,” he said, but he explained his ministry was left scrambling after the shutdown was announced. The country had never had an educational television channel before, and because of the low rates of Internet access in the country, setting up online lessons with video conferencing and interactive lectures would have been impossible. About 36 percent of Pakistani households have broadband Internet access, according to government figures, and according to the World Bank 15.5 percent of the population used the Internet in 2016.

“We believe it has been very successful,” Mahmood said of the Teleschool channel. He said the feedback he has seen from parents and teachers has been overwhelmingly positive. But, he said, “it doesn’t replace the classroom.”

AD

Mahmood also acknowledged that the channel wasn’t reaching Pakistan’s poorest families and said his ministry is trying to develop educational radio programing.

Pakistan’s schools will be closed through the rest of the school year, officials announced this week, despite the easing of other lockdown restrictions. Coronavirus infections, meanwhile, are steadily increasing. As of Monday, the Health Ministry had recorded nearly 42,000 infections. More than 900 had died.

Imtiaz Ahmed, a headmaster at a school in Pakistan’s northern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, said hardly any of her students have been able to see the program. Like most government school students in Pakistan, the children at Ahmed’s school are mostly from poor families of farmers or day laborers, and they cannot afford a television set.

Once schools reopen, Ahmed said, it will take months to bring students back to the level they were at when the lockdown began. And she said she expects fewer students to return as more families put their children to work for additional income.

Partial coronavirus lockdowns in Pakistan have put millions out of work and are estimated to have pushed up to 10 million Pakistanis into poverty, according to government estimates.

Saima Ali, a middle-class housewife, said her family’s finances have taken a hit from the lockdown. Ali went to government schools as a child but insists on sending her children to private schools, where she believes they receive a better education.

“It’s expensive, it’s a lot for us, but we must by hook or by crook,” she said of scraping together the fee payments.

“We have a saying in Urdu: The most important wealth you are giving to your children is education.”

Now the Globe is threatening it won’t survive the year without at least a $7 million injection of cash.

AD

The playhouse — the brainchild of the American actor and director Sam Wanamaker — operates as a pure nonprofit, without any regular government support. It has lived “hand to mouth,” as its artistic director Michelle Terry put it, on guided tours, workshops, weddings, catering and ticket sales for packed performances of Hamlet and Macbeth, until the pandemic shut the playhouse down in March.

AD

Shakespeare’s Globe is just one of many British cultural institutions endangered by a long lockdown. Also struggling are other independent venues, including the Old Vic, the Royal Academy and Royal Albert Hall.

The London Theatre Consortium, which represents 13 venues in the city, told Parliament that their members didn’t see any way to operate with six feet of social distancing, and warned that their stages would not be able to open immediately when a lockdown is lifted (because it takes several months to ready a performance) and that if theaters were repeatedly opened and closed to deal with ensuing waves of infection, they wouldn’t survive economically.

AD

The outlook isn’t much better for the purely commercial theaters in the West End — the Victorian-era jewels that serve as London’s version of New York’s Broadway, staging everything from cutting-edge modern drama to long-running crowd-pleasers like “Les Misérables” and “Mama Mia!”

AD

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told Brits that the country will ease out of lockdown very slowly — always ready to slam on the brakes if new cases begin to spike. In June, the government hopes to open some schools and retail shops. In July, sit-down restaurants may again be serving meals — as long as the outbreak continues to remain manageable.

Tourism? Not likely in the short run, as the Johnson government has said it will order travelers to quarantine themselves for 14 days upon arrival.

AD

Operators of theater companies, cinemas, opera houses, concert halls and night clubs in Britain assume their large-scale, indoor gathering places may be the last to reopen, perhaps not until the end of the summer. Or later.

The full-scale replica of the open-air Globe, circa 1599, is a sublime place to experience Shakespeare, but a sketchy place to be during a viral outbreak.

AD

During a performance, half the audience sits on rows of hard benches in galleries above “the pit,” where a standing-room-only crowd of “groundlings” watch the play unfold, much as audiences did 400 years ago, shoulder-to-shoulder, often with an ale or a sausage in their hands, close enough to feel the spray from actor’s lips, who must project without the aid of microphones.

AD

Neil Constable, chief executive of the Globe, told The Washington Post it was hard to imagine how strict social-distancing might work in any playhouse, especially one like the Globe.

He said that because the main 1,500-person venue is open to the sky, the Globe’s season runs from April through October, when it generates most of its $30 million in annual revenue.

Constable assumed most or all of the summer season might be lost — and that theaters and many hospitality venues (like pubs) might not really rebound until there is a vaccine.

AD

This week, Parliament’s Committee of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has been taking testimony from cultural institutions struggling with the lockdown.

AD

One group, called the Theatre Trust, worried that the virus had thrown the sector into a downward spiral that would see many venues close.

The chairman of the committee, Conservative Party lawmaker Julian Knight, wrote to the government’s Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, that “Shakespeare's Globe is a world-renowned institution and not only part of our national identity, but a leading example of the major contribution the arts make to our economy.”

He said, “For this national treasure to succumb to covid-19 would be a tragedy.”

In their submission to Parliament, the Globe’s directors reminded the panel that “more people engage with us about Shakespeare than anywhere else in the world,” with a million visitors a year.

AD

AD

The Globe management called the shutdown “financially devastating,” and said without emergency funding and the continuation of Britain’s generous Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, which pays 85 percent government subsidizes the salaries of low to middle wage workers, “we will spend down our reserves and become insolvent.”

The BBC recalled in its report on the threat to the Globe that actors Ian McKellen, Christopher Plummer, Judi Dench, Jude Law, Ralph Fiennes and David Tennant had all performed on its stage.

The Globe chief executive said he was confident people will come to Shakespeare — and to British theater. But the theaters have to survive long enough for the doors to open again."

AD

AD

Nkurunziza, Ndayishimiye and Rwasa were all rebel leaders during the 1993-2005 civil war and come from the Hutu majority group. Both Ndayishimiye and Rwasa have assured their supporters of victory, setting the stage for street protests in the likely event that Rwasa is not announced the winner.

The ruling party has garnered support through social welfare programs, such as free maternal care, but has also been accused by human rights groups of regularly intimidating people into voting for them and using mass arrests to silence anti-government voices. The country’s economy is practically nonexistent, and more than 90 percent of its people rely on subsistence farming, leaving them susceptible to climate shocks.

“The Burundian people are determined to shape Burundi anew,” said Rwasa in a phone interview. “Our agitation is embarrassing the dictatorial system, which relies on harsh measures as if we were in a state of emergency. Despite this negative attitude and all ill treatments, we hope to get the big victory.”

AD

AD

More than 140 members of Rwasa’s party have been arrested since campaigning began on April 27, according to SOS Médias Burundi, a group of independent journalists.

Most foreign media outlets have been barred from reporting inside Burundi. Last Thursday, the government expelled a team of experts and the country’s World Health Organization representative after he raised concerns about large election rallies.

Regional election observers were also barred from monitoring Wednesday’s election as the government said they would have to abide by 14-day quarantine protocols after entering the country.

Nkurunziza’s government has refused to cooperate with the International Criminal Court and the United Nations’ human rights organization. The Burundian diaspora, which generally aligns with the opposition, will not be able to vote Wednesday because Burundian embassies have decided that doing so would breach social distancing measures.

AD

AD

At a recent rally, Ndayishimiye attempted to assuage public concerns about the coronavirus, which has only been confirmed in 42 people there.

“Do not be afraid. God loves Burundi and if there are people who have tested positive, it is so that God may manifest his power in Burundi,” he told supporters.

Ndayishimiye controls the ruling party’s youth wing, known as the Imbonerakure, who act as a sort of quasi-police force, especially in rural areas. U.N. investigators have repeatedly pointed to the Imbonerakure as the perpetrators of brutal crackdowns, citing instances of summary executions, torture, sexual violence and mass arrests.

After Nkurunziza extended his mandate and ran again for president in 2015, the military and Imbonerakure quashed street protests. Over the next two years, at least 1,200 were killed in violence, which the United Nations says was mostly carried out by the state’s various security forces. Almost all of the 400,000 who were displaced by the violence remain in camps, mostly in Tanzania, where they are unable to vote.

“The human rights situation is catastrophic on two fronts,” said Janvier Bigirimana, a Burundian lawyer and human rights activist living in exile in Belgium. “First, opposition activists continue to experience all kinds of violence with total impunity. Second, the government of Burundi favored the electoral campaign while sacrificing human lives in the face of the covid-19 pandemic.”

Rwasa’s rallies have drawn large crowds despite the specter of a crackdown. As a rebel leader, Rwasa was also accused of numerous human rights abuses, but human rights groups have praised his restraint even as hundreds of his supporters are arrested.

“His members have been pretty good about not retaliating in face of arrests and killings,” said Lane Hartill, an American researcher at the Burundi Human Rights Initiative. “Having said that, the temperature is increasing. Everyone’s really on edge.”

AD

AD

Hartill and Burundian activists expressed some skepticism that Nkurunziza would step down, even if his own chosen successor won the election. Nkurunziza adopted the title of “eternal supreme guide” of his ruling party two years ago.

If Nkurunziza does step down, he is assured a $530,000 parting gift as well as a luxury mansion according to a law passed in his most recent term. The law gave some activists reason to believe that he would step down, and that real change, however incremental, might be afoot.

“We want a project of a hopeful society for a destitute population,” said Anschaire Nikoyagize, president of Ligue Iteka, a Burundian human rights organization, from exile in Uganda. “The constant courage and commitment of a population subjected to bloody repression and all the hate speech emanating from the Burundian authorities will lead to a popular revolution if it’s not heard.”

Moderna’s announcement comes days after one of its directors, Moncef Slaoui, stepped down from the board to become chief scientist for Operation Warp Speed, a White House initiative to speed up vaccine development. Watchdogs called out Slaoui’s apparent conflict of interest. Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Slaoui’s stock options in Moderna are worth more than $10 million with the company’s share price at $66.69. In regular trading Monday, Moderna’s stock soared almost 20 percent to $80.

Moderna also received $483 million from the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a federal agency. Moderna has also partnered with a contract development and manufacturing firm, Lonza, and Slaoui stepped down from that company’s board on Monday.

Slaoui will divest his Moderna stock holdings, effective Tuesday morning, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services said Monday afternoon. He will donate the value the Moderna stock gained since Thursday, before the announcement of his position leading Operation Warp Speed, to cancer research.

Companies and countries are racing to create a coronavirus vaccine and taking on financial risk to manufacture doses in large quantities before they even know if the products are safe and effective. The U.S. is aiming to have hundreds of millions of doses of a vaccine broadly available by the end of the year.

An effort led by the University of Oxford, in partnership with pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, plans to have millions of doses of vaccine available by fall. Last week, those researchers disclosed that more than 1,000 patients had already enrolled in the initial trial of its vaccine, which began in late April.

A Chinese company, Sinovac Biotech, recently published a study in the journal Science showing that its vaccine protected rhesus monkeys against infection and is currently being tested in 144 people. Two other safety trials are ongoing in the U.S., led by Pfizer and Inovio Pharmaceuticals.

AD

AD

Vaccine experts have said that these accelerated development timelines are theoretically possible, but extremely optimistic — and depend on everything going right. They stress that it will be crucial to gather convincing data the vaccines are safe and effective before using them broadly — and the new data are promising but preliminary, from the earliest phase one trials that test safety in healthy people.

“I would certainly take this as good news, and it’s certainly worth moving forward” into later stage trials, said Daniel Salmon, director of the Institute for Vaccine Safety at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “There’s just historically, if you look at vaccine development, lots of vaccines that look good out of phase one that don’t turn out to be good products.”

The data released Monday by Moderna is encouraging, but represents only a first step in a long process to bring a vaccine to market. It comes from an interim report on dozens of patients followed over weeks, whereas vaccine approval requires broad testing in thousands of patients followed over many months or years.

AD

AD

Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, said the data looked promising and it made sense to proceed to a large trial this summer.

“The fact that the vaccine elicited neutralizing antibody amounts comparable or higher to those found in convalescent sera [plasma] is very encouraging,” said Arturo Casadevall, chair of molecular microbiology and immunology at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who is spearheading the initiative to test plasma as a treatment.

Peter Jay Hotez, who is working on developing a coronavirus vaccine at the Baylor College of Medicine, said it would be important to understand the level of antibodies detected in the patients beyond the information provided in a company news release. He pointed to emerging evidence that many recovered patients do not muster high levels after they recover — and that high levels of antibodies may be needed to neutralize the virus.

AD

AD

The vaccine showed few safety signals, aside from redness at the injection site for one patient and some transient “systemic” symptoms in three patients given the highest dose — which the company will not be using in future trials.

The interim data comes from a clinical trial aimed at showing the safety of its experimental vaccine and helping the company select the correct dose. The company has not yet picked the final dose, or announced the size or length of the large trial that it will start in July, which will be the key one that regulators consider to decide whether the vaccine is safe and effective.

This month, the company received permission from the Food and Drug Administration to begin a 600-person, phase two trial to begin to test the effectiveness of the vaccine.

AD

“We are very, very happy because first the vaccine was generally safe,” Stephane Bancel, chief executive of Moderna said in an interview. “The piece that was really exciting and was the big question, of course, was can you find antibodies in people in enough quantities” to prevent disease.

AD

Moderna also reported that the vaccine protected mice who were vaccinated and then exposed to the virus, preventing it from multiplying in their lungs.

Moderna’s vaccine uses a genetic material called messenger RNA that codes for the distinctive spike protein that studs the outside of the novel coronavirus. The vaccine delivers the messenger RNA to cells, which then follows the genetic instructions to create the virus protein — allowing the body to learn to recognize and neutralize the pathogen."

Up and down the supply chain, from factories to hospitals, opportunists are benefiting from the chaotic market as prices have quintupled. Rampant price gouging and fraud has provoked dozens of lawsuits and hundreds of cease-and-desist orders, from major mask manufacturers as well as state attorneys general.

AD

While profiteers and crooks make their fortunes, medical workers across the United States are rationing masks, recycling them and treating infected patients without them. The federal government has taken steps to address the shortages, but emergency management experts say the efforts were distressingly inadequate. The Trump administration ignored early warnings that it needed to shore up its stockpile of masks and other personal protective equipment and has fallen behind several other Western nations in the race to secure them, documents and interviews show.

AD

Current and former government officials interviewed by The Washington Post say the most powerful country in the world should not have suffered from shortages of a basic, low-tech product.

“The lack of preparation and coordination has been appalling,” said Stephen S. Morse, an epidemiologist at Columbia University who has advised Republican and Democratic administrations on planning for a pandemic.

AD

“In past disasters, the federal government, with its enormous buying power, took the lead in procurement,” he said. “This time, federal inaction forced states into competing with each other for these scarce products. ”

Canada moved more quickly to manage the crisis. Early on, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau focused on the logistics of shipping and manufacturing. He assigned a team to develop a plan to expand domestic manufacturing of masks and immediately obtain supplies from the world’s largest producer of PPE: China. Canada’s mask procurement operation has not been problem-free — some large orders have fallen through or not passed muster with inspectors — but overall the country achieved faster and better results than the United States.

AD

U.S. government efforts to procure masks hit another setback last week, when the Food and Drug Administration partly reversed course on an initiative designed to increase availability. Since April 3, it had been allowing a class of Chinese-made masks to be imported for hospital use despite not meeting previous U.S. regulatory standards. On Thursday, the FDA sharply cut the number of Chinese manufacturers cleared for import after finding that some masks did not provide the promised protection. The reversal has sown confusion among the Chinese manufacturers on which the United States depends for key supplies.

AD

“This is an unprecedented pandemic and while the FDA continues to take action to balance the urgent need of supplies of respirators for health care personnel, we are also doing everything in our authority to ensure health care personnel receive adequate protection,” agency spokeswoman Brittney Manchester wrote in an email.

The federal government’s long-standing estimate is that the United States needs 3.5 billion masks to respond to a serious pandemic. As of May 7, according to the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the Department of Health and Human Services and the private sector had either “coordinated the delivery of or are currently shipping” 86.1 million N95 respirators. The government has lined up contracts to obtain another 600 million masks in the coming months, partly from U.S. manufacturers — such as Honeywell and 3M — that have ramped up domestic factory production.

AD

The administration’s most touted program to ship protective gear, Project Airbridge, has distributed just 768,000 N95 masks, according to a recent Post analysis of the latest FEMA records.

AD

While some states and cities report improved stocks of medical masks, many areas in the United States remain dangerously short of what’s needed, according to interviews with state officials, nurses and other front-line providers.

President Trump recently disputed such accounts, including one nurse’s complaint of “sporadic” supplies of medical masks, telling nurses gathered May 6 in the Oval Office, “I’ve heard we have tremendous supply to almost all places.”

‘Sea of sleaze’

As the virus spread through parts of China in January, Wong searched fruitlessly in Hong Kong for masks for her young children. That’s when she saw a potential business opportunity.

AD

AD

Wong has worked in the high-stakes San Francisco real estate market and launched an Asia-based tech start-up. She knows the political contours on both sides of the Pacific. But she says she’s never faced a more dicey business than dealing in masks during a pandemic.

Her description of a daily dilemma to sort out legitimate deals from scams illustrates what U.S. states and hospitals encounter as they seek relatively small shipments of masks. Wong did not provide records documenting her volume of deliveries, but The Post confirmed at least two successful deals, including one with a Louisiana-based hospital chain. A review of business and court records in San Francisco shows that Wong built a sizable real estate business over the past decade, one that attracted civil lawsuits against her company and occasional liens for failure to pay taxes and franchise fees.

To secure mask contracts, Wong lines up buyers and sellers in a market that involves proof of funds on one side and proof of product on the other. Money goes into escrow accounts, while in-person or video evidence jokingly known as “proof of life” inspections are carried out to make sure the product really exists.

AD

AD

Much of that is normal in international trade. What is unusual, Wong said, is how much fraud there is.

“Imagine what it’s like to navigate this sea of sleaze to get people the masks they need,” she said.

Of all the potential mask buyers and sellers with whom she has come in contact, Wong estimates that less than 20 percent are real. Escrow provides some sanity: The buyer’s money goes into an account controlled by an independent agent and is only released when the transaction is confirmed.

But before that happens, Wong says she has to identify what’s real and what isn’t. She regularly sees sophisticated forgery of financial documents and even videos of fake caches of masks. She provided examples to The Post that reflected forged financial statements from banks including Chase and PNC with balances ranging from hundreds of millions of dollars to $3 billion.

AD

AD

Federal investigators have already charged a mask seller in the United States for wire fraud. On April 10 in Atlanta, federal authorities arrested and charged Christopher Parris, a 39-year-old businessman, after he offered to sell the Department of Veterans Affairs 125 million N95 masks. An affidavit filed by a federal special agent in the case states the businessman’s credentials were suspect and the masks, as it turned out, didn’t exist. Parris could not be reached and the attorney who represented him in a separate case in Rochester, N.Y., did not respond to a request for comment.

50 states of chaos

Several dozen state and local government officials, hospital executives and medical supply brokers interviewed by The Post in recent weeks echoed Wong’s account, describing a process riddled with lies.

Andy Beshear, a Democrat, had been serving as Kentucky’s governor for just a few months when the novel coronavirus hit his state. Beshear began holding 5 p.m. briefings each weekday, sometimes appealing for donations of personal protective equipment.

“This is a Breeders’ Cup of PPE,” he said in April, using a thoroughbred racing analogy to describe a recent mask donation. “It comes from Kentuckians, knowing what we’re fighting is the challenge of our lifetime and giving up the supplies that they have. It is the selfless, we’re-all-in-it-together attitude that we are seeing from everybody.”

In an interview, Beshear said his duty is to his own constituents first. “If I have to compete with other states, I will compete with other states.”

The mask shortage has been one of his most difficult challenges during the pandemic, though the state now has enough to expand testing significantly.

AD

At one point, Kentucky paid $8.60 a piece on an order of 1,000 N95s, a number that wouldn’t supply an average hospital for long.

The governor said he has competed with the federal government at times.

He recounted one incident where a company informed his aides that FEMA had rerouted Kentucky’s shipment of N95 masks. “They were diverted to one of the hot spots. I can’t argue with that, but it did add to our challenge.”

“Our hospitals are securing enough to get by, though our nursing homes are struggling,” he said. “The costs that we’re having to pay are outrageous, but at the same time, this a hundred-year pandemic.”

The same problems are filtering down to local governments across the country. Andrew Hime, a purchasing agent for Maryland’s Anne Arundel County, says he has been forced to navigate the treacherous foreign markets — an unfamiliar assignment for a local official.

“There are people we’ve never dealt with before, and we’re going to pay five times the normal price,” he said. “But they’re the only folks who are telling me that they can get product at a certain date.”

Before the crisis, top quality N95 masks traded for about a dollar apiece, but those days are gone as global demand has shot way past supply. Hime says he is bombarded with offers that are steadily getting more expensive.

Among a bevy of promotional fliers is one decorated with a fuchsia-colored banner from Ontario-based Vanguard Pharma offering N95s for $6.30 each in mid-April. The company advertises itself on its website as “salesforce solutions” for the pharmaceutical industry but says nothing about sales of masks or other protective equipment.

Canadian antitrust lawyer Antonio Di Domenico, an expert in price-gouging laws, said that such markups could be a problem. The U.S. leading manufacturer of medical masks, 3M, says it has not changed the price it charges for the masks as a result of the pandemic.

“To the extent that companies are retailing N95 masks for large multiples over 3M’s list price — and there is evidence that their costs associated with bringing them to market do not justify the markup — then they could be exposed to prosecution under Ontario’s recently enacted price-gouging measures,” Di Domenico said.

Executives from Vanguard Pharma did not return emails, calls or texts seeking comment this week.

Even a state behemoth like California has been beset by problems as it sought to obtain masks. On Monday, state officials were grilled by California State Assembly oversight committee looking into several troubled masks deals. The questions focused on the state’s decision in March to buy 100 million N95 masks from a new supplier, Blue Flame Medical. The state of Maryland terminated a contract earlier this month with Blue Flame after state officials said it failed to deliver on a $12.5 million contract for masks and other equipment.

A lawyer for Blue Flame said the company was acting in good faith in its dealings with California, Maryland and other clients.

In California, legislators wanted to know why the state contracted for such a huge number of masks with a company that had no track record. The state halted the contract and got an immediate refund after receiving a warning from Blue Flame’s bank.

“The sense of urgency and panic, trying to get supplies, rushing to compete with the federal government and other states, created the need for expediency,” the state’s treasurer, Fiona Ma, told legislators at the hearing.

California has also ordered 375 million N95s from BYD Precision Manufacture that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined this month did not meet all of its certifications. The firm has described the problems as “easily fixable,” and the state won’t have to pay until the masks win federal approval.

At every level, government officials are also having to find ways to filter out the crooks, gougers and incompetent players who have moved to take advantage of the crisis.

“It’s all taken a rhythm in government that government ain’t used to,” said Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman (D). Even now, he would welcome federal officials stepping in to make mass purchases. “But we can’t rely on the federal government.”

HHS officials were warned about this potential shortfall in late January, when one of America’s major mask manufacturers emailed former HHS official Rick Bright, offering to open the company’s closed factories to boost domestic production of masks. While Bright warned department officials of the need to rebuild the stockpile, according to a whistleblower complaint, no one took Prestige Ameritech chief executive Mike Bowen up on his offer.

Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.) said in an interview that the warnings the administration received in January to bolster the nation’s stockpile amounted to “a flashing red light.”

“Words are inadequate to describe the inaction,” he said. “So much of this was preventable. It did not have to happen this way.”

‘Is this a joke?’

In mid-March, a White House task force assembled by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, and staffed by inexperienced volunteers began vetting potential suppliers to import masks from abroad.

In an email exchange from late March obtained by The Post, an executive at an Australian trading company expressed bewilderment to one of the volunteers about the administration’s informal and disjointed approach to entrust such a critical mission to a group of novices. The Post withheld the names of the people in the correspondence as a condition of describing the email exchange.

The executive, who is a U.S.-based American citizen, was working with the task force to help the State Department navigate the supply chain and source masks from a factory in China.

“I am a volunteer working on the White House Task Force combating COVID-19,” the task force member wrote to the executive. “We’ve been doing this for a while now and have outlined a process to make everything move smoothly.”

The task force member outlined a multistep process and included a link to a U.S. procurement website. He said the team would require an inspection of the factory to proceed.

“No offense, but is this a joke?” the executive replied. “The world is burning down, you guys are volunteers, who is coordinating this? Volunteers?”

The executive warned that the United States was already behind in the race to secure masks.

“People are dying,” he wrote. “Let’s fix this.”

Kushner’s office did not respond to a request for comment about the email exchange, though the White House senior adviser has defended his volunteers in a statement. “The bottom line is that this program sourced tens of millions of masks and essential PPE in record time and Americans who needed ventilators received ventilators,” Kushner said. “These volunteers are true patriots.”

By the time the task force started reaching out to find new suppliers of N95 masks, it may have already been too late for the United States to make a big move.

Christopher Kirchhoff, who was director for strategic planning on the National Security Council in the Obama administration, says there were two ways to make sure the United States had enough critical supplies to handle the crisis.

“Use the free market. Or use the federal departments whose mission it is to source and allocate scarce resources in a public emergency.”

Trump has been reluctant to make broad use of federal power, such as invoking the Defense Production Act, the Korean War-era statute that gives presidents the authority over factories and supply chains to secure critical equipment.

The shortage has forced American hospitals, fire departments and paramedics into agonizing choices this spring to not resuscitate infected patients who go into cardiac arrest because of concern for medical staff members.

Trump briefly invoked the Defense Production Act, requiring 3M to cease delivering masks to foreign buyers who had contracted for them. But the president’s instructions were later changed in part because of concerns it could result in retaliatory action against the United States.

While the Trump administration left much of the heavy lifting to the states, other countries had a national strategy. The government of France alone has bought 2 billion face masks, including 400 million N95s.

In an interview, Kieke Okma, a former Dutch health official, said that because of their centralized medical systems, European countries, including her own, already have systems in place to buy and distribute medical equipment in bulk for hospitals.

In Canada, government and private sector officials said this week that their own shortage of N95 masks had largely been resolved, at least for now.

The short-term effort was led in part by Canadian diplomats and consultants in Beijing and Shanghai who developed connections to manufacturers. The Canadians then leased warehouse facilities in China to be sure that the acquired masks were secure before they passed through customs on their way to Canada.

In Ottawa, Trudeau’s government asked the country’s two major airlines to set up an air bridge bringing supplies quickly into the country. Once the masks arrived, federal officials worked with provincial leaders to distribute them where they were most urgently needed, Canadian officials said.

The country also fought gouging aggressively. As the pandemic spread, two provinces passed new laws against the practice, and others encouraged more aggressive enforcement of existing laws.

Canada may also have benefited from relatively calm diplomatic relations with China as tensions were spiking with the United States.

Kirchhoff, who in 2016 wrote a White House paper on lessons learned from the Ebola epidemic, says the Trump administration missed an opportunity to alleviate the shortages with bold, early action.

“This administration’s response introduced chaos precisely because it did not mobilize the federal machinery it alone commands‚” he said."

The same month she contracted the novel coronavirus, Wilson-Griffin was finalizing her latest endeavor: creating a maternal triage acuity index for pregnant women.

But on March 20, the day her proposal was scheduled for approval by her academic adviser, Wilson-Griffin succumbed to the virus. The 63-year-old was the first person in St. Louis County to die of covid-19.

She was a “gentle driving force for change,” said Laura Kuensting, her committee chair for her doctor of nursing practice program at the University of Missouri, St. Louis College of Nursing.

“Her number one motivation was because she cared about the health of women, especially black women and their babies,” Kuensting said.

At Barnes Hospital, now BJC Hospital, where Wilson-Griffin worked from 1981 through 2007, she was instrumental in creating the state’s first maternal transport teams for high-risk pregnant mothers when she learned black women and their babies had a higher mortality rate in the United States.

AD

AD

Her new venture was through her clinical scholarship project for her program, from which she was scheduled to graduate in December.

Kuensting and Wilson-Griffin were scheduled to meet on the evening of March 20 to review the proposal, but when the typically prompt Wilson-Griffin didn’t arrive on time, concern washed over Keunsting.

She waited about 30 minutes for a response from Wilson-Griffin before tapping into her nursing network, which confirmed Wilson-Griffin’s death. “I was devastated,” Keunsting said.

Wilson-Griffin’s death underscores the disparity with which the virus is ravaging black populations across the country. The grandmother of four had been living with lupus for years, according to her daughter, Valerie Griffin. The disease is three times more common in black women than white women. Wilson-Griffin’s health history and her age made her more susceptible to complications caused by the virus.

AD

AD

Wilson-Griffin’s commitment to others had been recognized at all levels by friends, family and also the nursing community, which awarded her the 2019 March of Dimes Missouri Chapter Nurse of the Year in Women’s Health and Obstetrics .

Her death has left behind a stunned medical community that respected her passion for marginalized women and their unborn children, and a family in pain.

Compassionate caregiver

Wilson-Griffin had a knack for doing the unorthodox for the benefit of those who needed her help, said her longtime friend and colleague Pamela Lesser, director of perinatal services at SSM St. Mary’s Health Center, where Wilson-Griffin last worked as a perinatal clinical nurse specialist.

AD

The model of care in the 1980s was for newborns to remain in the nursery most of the time after a birth, Lesser said.

AD

Wilson-Griffin told the other hospital staff that the mother was going to take the baby home in a few days, and that the hospital wouldn’t be caring for the infant after the hospital stay ended, according to Lesser.

“The baby’s staying in the room because it’s the right thing to do,” Lesser remembered Wilson-Griffin saying when a mother wanted her baby in her room overnight.

It wasn’t the first time her intuition led her to help a patient in an unusual way.

As a U.S. Navy Reserve Nurse Corps member deployed overseas during the Gulf War, she helped a soldier who had endured sleepless nights because he heard voices.

AD

The labor and delivery nurse had no expertise in this kind of medical care, but she wanted to help, Lesser recalled of her friend’s active-duty time, which also required her to set up a field hospital that had nothing to do with birthing babies.

AD

She told the distressed man that she would put the voices in the refrigerator overnight for him so he could sleep. The young man slept through the night.

“She got in trouble because they said he was going to have a food aversion,” Lesser told The Washington Post, laughing as she recalled the story.

Wilson-Griffin’s tenacity for knowledge and advancing patient care inspired other nurses confronting complex problems to think: “What would Judy do?”

AD

Lesser and Wilson-Griffin’s collaborations on ideas and projects created such a tightknit relationship that the two joked they shared a brain. Sometimes mail would arrive to the hospital addressed to “Pamela Wilson” or “Judy Lesser.”

“In many ways, she was more like a sister to me,” Lesser said.

Something about her

Of her achievements, the connection Wilson-Griffin formed with her daughter, Valerie Griffin, was one of her most prized.

AD

Valerie Griffin was in her 20s when she met the woman who eventually became her stepmother. Her father, Tyrone Griffin, had been divorced for years, and his daughter watched him navigate the dating scene. When she met Wilson-Griffin for the first time, Valerie said she “loved her instantly.”

AD

The new woman in her father’s life had a compelling warm energy that effortlessly won over Griffin and her brother, Tyrone Griffin Jr.

She watched as her father courted Wilson-Griffin, the woman who would offer Valerie Griffin dating advice over dinners and a supportive ear during shopping ventures.

The two women grew closer when Tyrone Sr. became ill with lung cancer in January 1996. She lent her medical expertise to be hands-on with his medical treatment plan and comforted Valerie Griffin throughout her father’s swift decline. His rapidly devolving health welded the two women together.

AD

“I don’t know what we would’ve done without her,” Griffin said.

AD

Tyrone and Judy married in April 1996. He died two months later. She remained a Wilson-Griffin until her last day.

“She loved my father,” Griffin said. “Loved him.”

When Griffin’s mother died three years after her father, Wilson-Griffin salved her daughter’s loss by becoming the maternal figure young adults need as they try to balance moving through the world and figuring out who they are.

She would be there for Griffin throughout her first pregnancy and in the delivery room when she gave birth to her daughter, MaKayla, who is now 14.

“The minute I started going into labor, she started calling her friends,” Griffin said. “Everyone was looking for me and looking after me.”

Wilson-Griffin remembered her daughter’s gynecologist from the days when he was a resident at the hospital. At least 20 other people connected to Wilson-Griffin were in her daughter’s room, cheering her on and caring for her through her delivery.

Her presence would remain steadfast at soccer, basketball and field hockey games her granddaughters would play or violin recitals she found time to attend. Wilson-Griffin would take the girls and her grandson, T.J., on summer vacations that included a train ride to Chicago or caravan trips to the Deep South, where she would visit family.

Pray for Nana

In mid-March, as news of the novel coronavirus spread across the country and organizations started canceling large gatherings, Wilson-Griffin drove to Indianapolis to attend a professional nursing conference. Griffin fussed at her mom for deciding to go despite the risk.

AD

Griffin said this conference needed to be her last for a while.

The next week, Wilson-Griffin was hospitalized with pneumonia, a condition she had experienced before because of her lupus.

Wilson-Griffin told her daughter she might be able to see her once she was cleared by doctors. Griffin told her mom to keep her posted. She asked her daughters to pray for their nana.

The next day, Griffin texted her mom but heard nothing. She would eventually learn her mother had been sedated because her breathing had become labored. Wilson-Griffin was diagnosed with the virus on a Wednesday. By Friday, her dear friend Lesser suited up in protective gear to see her and to report back to the family.

The family never got to tell her goodbye.

The virus had caused her organs and health functions to shut down. Wilson-Griffin died before doctors could remove her from a ventilator.

She was buried with her late husband in Jefferson Barracks National Cemetery in St. Louis.

Birthdays above

At midnight on what would’ve been her 64th birthday, more than five weeks after Wilson-Griffin died, her granddaughters wished her a happy birthday in the family’s group text.

“We love and miss you already,” one text read. The other wished her fun in heaven.

The family gathered at Wilson-Griffin’s home later that day to release pillow-shaped balloons into the sky with messages for her eyes only.

The department store chain posted a 41 percent drop revenue for the quarter, offering a stark reminder of how the pandemic is boosting some retailers while hastening the demise of others.

AD

Consumer spending has dropped precipitously in the weeks since the pandemic took hold. U.S. retail sales fell a record 8.3 percent in March, then plunged 16.4 percent in April, according to Commerce Department data, as Americans stopped spending on clothing, furniture, housewares and other nonessentials.

AD

Retailers temporarily closed more than 260,000 stores because of the coronavirus outbreak, all but bringing business to a halt for many companies that rely on in-store shoppers to drive the bulk of their sales. Four major retailers — J. Crew, Neiman Marcus, Stage Stores and J.C. Penney — have filed for bankruptcy this month, and analysts say they expect others to follow as more companies run out of cash and the economy continues to sour.

Pier 1, which had filed for bankruptcy weeks before the shutdowns, announced Tuesday it would cease operations altogether. It had planned to closed 450 of its 936 stores and shed 40 percent of its workforce and find a buyer, but the pandemic ended those hopes.

AD

“It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy: the bigger, stronger players are taking even more market share,” said Mickey Chadha, senior credit officer at the rating agency Moody’s. “And the companies that were weak to begin with, they are only going to become weaker.”

AD

But spending on groceries has continued to climb. Walmart, the country’s largest grocer, said profits rose 4 percent, to $3.99 billion, during the first quarter. Demand has been so brisk that Walmart has hired more than 235,000 workers since mid-March, according to chief executive Doug McMillon. All 5,355 of the company’s U.S. stores have remained open during the pandemic.

“More than ever, the news this quarter is our amazing associates,” he said in a statement. “They are rising to the challenge to serve our customers and our communities.”

AD

But worker advocacy groups say the company’s gains have come at the risk of employees’ health. At least 22 Walmart employees have died from covid-related complications since March, according to labor advocacy group United for Respect.

Walmart said it is providing free masks and gloves to employees and has installed sneeze guards at its checkouts. It has also announced two rounds of bonuses — $150 for part-time workers, $300 for full-timers — who work through the pandemic. It said it spent nearly $900 million on employee bonuses and other covid-related costs.

AD

The retail giant also announced Tuesday that it is discontinuing the e-commerce site Jet.com “due to the continued strength of the Walmart brand.” Walmart paid $3.3 billion for Jet.com in 2016 and continued to invest heavily in the site in hopes that it would help win over younger, more affluent, big-city shoppers from Amazon. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)

AD

Home Depot, meanwhile, said sales at U.S. stores open at least one year rose nearly 8 percent. Profits fell nearly 12 percent to $2.25 billion, as the company spent more on wages and cleaning stores.

“Although the pandemic has shrouded the retail world in gloom, Home Depot’s results are something of a bright spot,” Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.

AD

That was not the case at Kohl’s, which was one of thousands of retailers that shut its stores and furloughed the majority of its workers in March. The department store chain posted $541 million quarterly loss, compared with a $62 million profit in the same period last year.

AD

“Kohl’s results show the extent of the damage the pandemic has caused to nonessential retailers,” Saunders said. Though he said a number of factors worked in the company’s favor, including its focus on fitness apparel and the location of its stores in strip centers instead of shopping malls, “the toll on the financial health of Kohl’s should not be underestimated.”

“If a reasonably well positioned retailer like Kohl’s is posting such bad numbers, it does not bode at all well for much weaker players in the market,” he said."

No two turns are the same. The walls, they come up on you quick. The car can win at some tracks. The driver must win at “The Track Too Tough to Tame.”

Yet Darlington, like so much about NASCAR’s unique and colorful roots, has been disrespected and disregarded by its top decision-makers — until those decision-makers needed old standbys to come through. The original 2020 NASCAR schedule had one race in the elite Cup Series at “The Lady in Black,” which is one more than at the similarly historic tracks abandoned years ago in North Wilkesboro and Rockingham, N.C.

AD

Somewhere along the road to becoming a chic mainstream sport, NASCAR lost its soul. Maybe a pandemic could help NASCAR rediscover it.

NASCAR became the first major U.S. sport to hold a regular season, this-really-counts event in two months when it staged a 400-mile race at Darlington on Sunday. It’ll follow with another Darlington race Wednesday night, doubling the number of Cup races the track was scheduled to host this year in a matter of four days.

Study the revised and still-evolving schedule — altered, of course, by the novel coronavirus pandemic that has changed every aspect of our lives — and note the tracks that are hosting seven Cup races between now and June 10: Darlington, Charlotte Motor Speedway, Bristol Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway and Martinsville Speedway. That right there is the heart of NASCAR’s old footprint. That right there is where any post-pandemic schedule should be based.

AD

I’m not going to pretend I follow the inner workings of NASCAR on a week-by-week — or, at this point, even a season-by-season — basis. But for most of two seasons, I covered this traveling circus for the News & Observer in Raleigh, N.C. They weren’t just any two seasons, either. They were 1999 and 2000, right when NASCAR was rocketing into widespread mainstream popularity, right when it was spreading to markets in every region of the nation, right when NBC and Fox combined to grant it a massive national television contract, right when it was losing its way before it could realize what was happening.

The rejiggered NASCAR schedule for this season is designed completely around the pandemic. These first seven Cup races are within easy driving distance of the headquarters for the vast majority of race teams, which is the Concord, N.C., area, just north of Charlotte. The idea is to limit competition to one day — no qualifying, no practice, just racin’ — and eliminate air travel and hotel stays.

There’s an opportunity within: What if, in the aftermath of all this, we relearn that — at least from a sports perspective — geography and the culture associated with it matter?

AD

AD

NASCAR originally grew from the rural South, where clever and resourceful mechanics souped up cars for bootleggers so they could outrun the law in dry counties. There was a creative rebelliousness about it all, and the cunning that went into speeding away from Smokey to deliver moonshine ended up in the NASCAR garage, where real American ingenuity took the shape of bent — and outright broken — rules, all in the name of making a car go fast. How original. How fun.

Just before the turn of this century, more people started to sense that originality and that fun. NASCAR pounced. What once was a regional sport with its headquarters in Daytona Beach, Fla., and its heart in the Carolinas expanded — quickly — into a national brand. The advertisers in New York wanted a piece and, in turn, NASCAR wanted a piece of Hollywood. New offices developed in Manhattan and Los Angeles. New sponsors elbowed each other out of the way. Disney made “Cars.” Will Ferrell made “Talladega Nights.” NASCAR knew no bounds.

With more demand came more supply, and the race calendar bulged. New markets percolated from coast to coast. There was money! There was attention! There was growth! In 1993, what was then known as the Winston Cup Series held 20 points races in seven southeastern states and 10 more spread among seven states, with just two races west of the Mississippi. NASCAR knew where its biscuits were buttered.

AD

AD

By 2005, by which time the top series had been renamed the Nextel Cup, regional loyalty and identity had been abandoned. A bursting-at-the-seams 36-race schedule featured 16 points races in those seven southeastern states — Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, Alabama, South Carolina and North Carolina — and the remaining 20 spread across a dozen states, with nine races west of the Mississippi.

And it wasn’t just the new markets that seemed like a cash grab. It was the construction of new tracks, so many of them nearly identical “tri-ovals” that served to maximize more expensive seating on long frontstretches, with the requisite corporate and sponsor boxes above the masses. No minnow pond would ever get in the way again.

What’s clear now was only predictable by pessimists back when I covered NASCAR: It ended up with a watered-down product on boring tracks spread across the country in front of fan bases that didn’t care as much, if they cared at all. By 2018, television ratings hit an all-time low. NASCAR stopped announcing in-person attendance. Many tracks removed grandstands. In pursuing new fans, NASCAR alienated its base.

AD

AD

Maybe the restructuring forced by the pandemic could win it back.

There’s really no way to tell what any specific sport will look like assuming we get to the other side of all this, but it just seems foolish to assume it’ll be precisely as it was when 2020 dawned. In a sense, the pandemic should force leagues to consider not only what’s best for the rest of this year but how they might improve well beyond.

After Wednesday night, the next two races on the Cup schedule are at Charlotte, which might not be the most interesting layout but at least is at the sport’s geographic epicenter and cultural core. Beyond, there’s the variety of the short tracks of Bristol and Martinsville. In late June comes the monstrous superspeedway in Talladega, Ala., as fast as the sport can go. Embrace it.

AD

Why not grow by shrinking? Race at Richmond and Atlanta, Daytona and Bristol, even Darlington again. Even without fans in the stands, pander to the base in hopes of recapturing it again, especially when there are precious few sporting alternatives to focus on.

In a Monday email, Vida Fitness urged members to email and call the mayor’s office to urge that gyms be among the first nonessential businesses allowed to resume operations. Officials suggested members tout the importance of exercise for a healthy immune system.

“We believe we have the means and methods to protect our members and our employees uniquely and more effectively than almost any other retail establishment out there,” David von Storch, president and founder of Vida’s parent company, said in an interview.

He said his facilities would reopen with a host of social distancing measures, with visits scheduled by appointment, temperature checks upon entry and face masks required. He also added that the gyms could assist city officials with contact tracing by providing names and contact information for anyone who may have come into contact with infected members.

The advocacy comes as an advisory group on reopening the District formed by the mayor is set to issue recommendations this week. With the District on track to meet metrics to lift social distancing measures, the mayor said she may have a reopening date Thursday, when she will update residents on the advisory group’s recommendations.

The current restrictions are set to expire June 8. A spokeswoman for the mayor declined to comment ahead of the Thursday briefing.

Von Storch has been in touch with the leaders of a committee focused on open spaces and recreation but got a cool reception.

Tommy Wells, director of the D.C. Department of Energy and Environment and co-chair of the recreation committee, said in a Monday email that fitness gyms will not be included in a Phase 1 opening.

“Outdoor programming with low intensity activities will be first,” Wells told Von Storch. “Let me assure you, if our committee had place[d] gyms in the first phase, it would have been removed by the chairs above us.”

Von Storch said the city needs to provide more flexibility to struggling businesses depending on their ability to impose social distancing measures."

The District, Maryland and Virginia have been in a near-total shutdown for months to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, but Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) and Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) are beginning to relax restrictions in their states. However, areas in the D.C. region that have been hit hard can delay reopening plans.

Northern Virginia will not begin to reopen until May 28 at the earliest — two weeks behind the rest of the state. In Maryland, leaders in Montgomery and Prince George’s counties have said it’s too soon to reopen.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) also says it’s too early to lift measures for the District, which had been set to expire Friday. Instead, she extended the city’s stay-at-home order, mass-gathering ban and closure of nonessential businesses through June 8, and at least until the decline in new cases lasts two weeks.

All three jurisdictions are looking for signs that the coronavirus “curve” — the number of infections over time — is flattening. They’ve set goals for increased testing capacity, a greater number of hospital beds and more protective equipment for front-line workers.

Despite rigid stay-at-home orders, hundreds of new cases are still reported each day. The number of known novel coronavirus cases in the greater Washington region has passed 70,000, and more than 3,000 people have died of covid-19, the disease the virus causes. The newly reported cases tend to stem from confined living quarters such as nursing homes and jails or are among essential workers and those who can’t afford to miss work or are unable to telecommute.

More than 885,000 people in the District, Maryland and Virginia have lost their jobs during the past seven weeks, according to federal data.

Here are answers to frequently asked questions.

What are the current restrictions in the DMV?

Maryland and Virginia have relaxed some of the restrictions that have been in place, while the District and its suburbs remain mostly shut down.

In Virginia, some restaurants, barber shops, and hair and nail salons in areas outside Northern Virginia can reopen with limited capacity, and religious organizations are cleared to hold reduced-capacity services.

Much of Maryland has similar precautions in place, although restaurants remain closed for in-person dining. Populous areas of the state, including Montgomery and Prince George’s counties, remain closed.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser this week extended the restrictions in the city to June 8. Starting on Saturday, D.C. residents and visitors are required to wear face coverings when out in public near others, with some exceptions. People who are exercising or walking do not need to wear a mask, as long as they stay six feet away from others.

For a look across the nation, The Washington Post also has a state-by-state review of the stay-at-home orders.

When will the region reopen?

Any reopening will be gradual, with restrictions lifted in phases.

Each jurisdiction has set goals for lower infection rates, increased testing, greater hospital capacity and much more personal protective gear. Until those goals are met, local officials say most restrictions will remain in place.

In addition to rolling back restrictions outside Northern Virginia, Gov. Ralph Northam (D) also may adjust the stay-at-home order that expires June 10, which restricts gatherings and other social activities.

[When will Virginia reopen?]

In Maryland, Hogan already has eased some restrictions on outdoor activities, opening public beaches and golf courses in the state. The Washington Post’s Erin Cox reports the plan is to reopen businesses and allow certain social activities in phases.

[When will Maryland reopen?]

Bowser extended the city’s stay-at-home order, ban on mass gatherings and closure of nonessential businesses through June 8. Starting Friday, however, educational and academic retail shops, such as bookstores, can seek waivers to reopen for curbside and front-door pickup sales.

The mayor has created an advisory group, led by Susan E. Rice and Michael Chertoff, to decide when and how to lift restrictions.

[When will D.C. reopen?]

Why are people still getting sick in the region?

Doctors and public health officials tell The Post the coronavirus is increasingly infecting people who cannot afford to miss work — such as grocery store employees, delivery drivers and construction workers. Despite the broad shutdown, there’s still communal spread.

Increased testing across the region helps explain why the daily case count continues to rise. “That is expected,” said Laurie Forlano, Virginia’s deputy commissioner of health. “Obviously we’ll detect more cases, and those cases will be counted.”

But health experts say the region is far from testing enough of the population, including those who are symptomatic and those who are not, to truly know who is infected. The District, Maryland and Virginia do not have enough contact tracers in place to sketch a picture of how the coronavirus is spreading.

Where can I get tested for covid-19?

New testing sites are popping up across the region. Most — but not all — sites require a doctor’s note and scheduled appointment. Clinicians are prioritizing front-line workers and adults who are 65 or older.

Local officials have repeatedly stated reopening the region will depend on how fast they can expand testing capacities in the coming weeks. Health experts say the region still needs to test far more of the population to get a clear picture of who has the virus.

Here’s an updating list of testing sites in the District, Maryland and Virginia.

Can I travel for work? Can I travel out of state?

Certain jobs are listed as essential, and those people are still allowed to travel for work. The definition of essential differs slightly in all three jurisdictions. Read more here.

Some Americans are concerned about heading to work as states reopen businesses to restart the economy. Here are common questions and answers regarding an employee’s rights when returning to work.

There are no restrictions on interstate travel in or out of the District, Maryland or Virginia. However, officials recommend those traveling in from out-of-state locations self-quarantine for 14 days.

Can I go to church, the mosque or synagogue?

Religious institutions in the southern and western parts of Virginia on Friday were cleared to resume indoor services for groups larger than 10.

Houses of worship in Maryland will be allowed to operate at 50 percent capacity — unless local governments deem it unsafe. The Post’s Sarah Pulliam Bailey and Michelle Boorstein report many religious leaders in the area are hesitant to open up their doors again.

The District allows residents to travel to places of worship, but most services have been canceled because of the limitations on gatherings in the region.

A coalition of religious leaders, business owners and Maryland state lawmakers are suing the state government over the governor’s stay-at-home orders. In the lawsuit, the group argues Hogan is violating the constitutional rights of individuals to gather to worship or engage in free speech.

Is public transportation open? Are there any restrictions?

Starting Monday, Metro will require riders to wear masks while on a bus or train. The transit agency has reduced service after “significant” drops in ridership due to regional stay-at-home orders and advised passengers to use Metro only if no other option is available.

Metro officials don’t plan for service to return to pre-pandemic levels until spring of next year, The Post’s Justin George reports. The transit agency plans to continue the current reduced-service schedule until the start of the school year.

Metrobus operates from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. on weekdays and 8 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. During the week, buses arrive on a Sunday schedule, and over the weekend, they arrive every 30 minutes. All customers should enter and exit the bus at the rear door, except those using mobility devices or who require bus kneeling. Fares are waived during this time.

The D.C. Streetcar operates Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. for essential trips only. Passengers are encouraged to allow extra travel time, as D.C. Streetcars will arrive approximately every 20 minutes.

In Prince George’s County, residents are required to cover their faces on the county’s bus system.

Amtrak has reduced its service between Washington and Boston by as much as 35 percent, The Post’s Luz Lazo reported. All passengers on Amtrak trains and in stations are required to wear masks. The rail company will restore some service on June 1, with the return of Acela, the premier passenger trains that run through the Northeast Corridor.

When will schools open? What about colleges and universities?

Schools in Virginia, Maryland and the District are closed for the rest of the academic year, but remote learning is underway.

In the District, instruction will end in late May, instead of June 19. Some charter schools say they will remain open into June. Private schools are following their own schedules, though most are expected to remain closed through the academic year.

The public school system says it will offer summer school, though it is still unclear if that will be done in person, remotely, or a combination of the two.

Maryland officials say masks, temperature checks and shortened weeks could become the norm when students return to in-person instruction, The Post’s Donna St. George reports.

Schools in Montgomery County and Fairfax County have grappled with the complications related to transitioning to full-time online learning.

Most jurisdictions are offering free meals to students and all children, and the federal government is allowing school districts to distribute meals “to a parent or guardian to take home to their children,” The Post’s Hannah Natanson reports. Here is a list of places to pick up breakfast and lunch in the District, Maryland and Virginia.

Local colleges and universities have cleared their campuses, too, but are now facing questions about how to fill classrooms in the fall. Hundreds of colleges and universities have pushed back admission decision deadlines to June 1 and offered extensions, especially for out-of-state students.

As schools prepare for next semester, leaders are considering a few different options — including extending virtual classes, bringing students back to campus for in-person classes, or a hybrid model in which students do both. Final decisions may not come for weeks.

Officials at George Washington University said they will make a decision about next semester by June 15, though university President Thomas J. LeBlanc warned he may extend that deadline as it approaches. Jay A. Perman, chancellor of the University System of Maryland, which includes U-Md. and 14 other public universities and education centers, said he is “reasonably optimistic” campuses will reopen by September.

What’s the situation at local nursing homes?

As of late April, at least 255 nursing homes in the greater Washington region reported coronavirus cases.

Former and current employees at Maryland nursing homes tell The Post their facilities are struggling with shortages of staff, testing and personal protective equipment. Maryland regulators already have announced fines for one nursing home.

Hogan has ordered universal testing for nursing home residents and employees, making Maryland one of the first states to do so.

The federal government issued guidelines in April requiring nursing homes to update patients’ families regularly on coronavirus cases in their facilities.

Maryland health officials publish a list online of every nursing home reporting an outbreak. As of May 6, according to state data, long-term-care facilities in Maryland have accounted for more than 6,000 of the state’s coronavirus infections and more than 800 covid-19-related deaths.

The District occasionally provides a list of nursing homes with outbreaks in the mayor’s daily briefing.

Virginia reports the aggregate total of outbreaks at nursing homes across the state but does not list specific long-term-care facilities.

What businesses are open? When will other stores reopen?

In Virginia, restaurants already licensed for outdoor seating can open at half-capacity with social distancing requirements, while barber shops and hair and nail salons can open for appointments and with strict guidelines. Nonessential retail stores can open with limits on the number of customers allowed in the store. Employees are required to wear face masks, and customers are strongly encouraged to wear them.

While religious organizations can hold services, gatherings must be at 50 percent capacity and are subject to other safety requirements. Movie theaters, concert venues, amusement parks, bowling alleys and indoor gyms remain closed.

In Maryland, many similar precautions are in place, although restaurants remain closed for in-person dining. Hogan replaced a statewide stay-at-home order with a “safer at home” policy that relaxes some restrictions.

The new policy allows some nonessential retailers to reopen, including clothing and shoe stores, pet groomers, animal adoption shelters, carwashes, art galleries and bookstores. But they must remain at 50 percent capacity or less, employees must wear masks, and other social distancing restrictions must be observed.

The changes took effect at midnight in Virginia and at 5 p.m. Friday in Maryland. The changes do not apply to Northern Virginia or the Maryland suburbs.

How can I apply for local unemployment benefits?

A few weeks ago, The Post’s personal finance columnist, Michelle Singletary, shared her guidance about eligibility and how to apply for unemployment benefits.

More than 885,000 people have filed for jobless benefits in the District, Maryland and Virginia since the Washington area closed down under the stay-at-home orders.

What do I need to know about grocery shopping?

Supermarkets, convenience stores and restaurants have all adapted to meet the changing demands, now that people in the Washington region are stocking up.

Face masks are required at grocery stores in the District and Maryland, while face coverings are recommended in Virginia but not mandated. Officials recommend shoppers wash their hands before and immediately after shopping for groceries and bring their own disinfectant wipes if planning to use a shopping cart.

Stores are offering older shoppers dedicated hours, usually early in the mornings, so they can shop without crowds. The District has extended sidewalks near some grocery stores to allow for social distancing.

Farmers markers in the region are still open, but vendors often require advance orders for curbside pickup. Farmers report more people are signing up for community-supported agriculture, or CSA, preorders, and some already have waitlists for new members. Restaurants are selling staples, like milk and eggs, alongside prepared takeout fare.

Can I go for a run? What else can I do outside?

The District, Maryland and Virginia’s stay-at-home orders allowed for walking, biking, dog walking, hiking and running outside, as long as people remain six feet away from those outside their household. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people build exercise into their routines during the outbreak to keep physically and mentally healthy.

A person is allowed to walk, bike or run through a park or trail, but all three jurisdictions caution against sitting or congregating in parks or public fields.

Maryland has relaxed some restrictions on outdoor activities. Public beaches are open for exercise. Family members from one household can go camping, fishing and hunting, as well. For more on what is and is not allowed outside under all three orders, read here.

How can I help?

People can donate blood, give to a local or national nonprofit, support local bars and restaurants or help an older adult with groceries.

Those decisions depend on a few key metrics: namely, downward trajectories in the rate of infection and number of people who are sick, plus indications the state has sufficient testing, protective equipment and monitoring in place to deal with a potential surge.

AD

AD

Here is what is open in some parts of the state — and the latest on the benchmarks state and local officials are using to decide whether reopening is safe.

New daily deaths per 100,000 residents

Is everything open?

Far from it. Even in southern and western Virginia, where most counties and cities have entered Phase 1, movie theaters, indoor gyms and restaurant dining rooms remain closed. Only restaurants already authorized for outdoor dining can offer sit-down service — outside, at half capacity, with patrons at least six feet apart and any game areas or playground facilities closed.

Virginia’s limit on gatherings of more than 10 people stays in place until June 10 but is waived to allow nonessential retailers to reopen at half of their lowest licensed capacity. All customers must be kept at least six feet apart. No fitting rooms. Face masks are required for employees and strongly encouraged for customers.

Outdoor exercise classes are allowed, with equipment disinfected and participants at least 10 feet apart. Outdoor pools can reopen for lap swimming, with one person per lane. Hair and nail salons can reopen by appointment and with strict limitations. Providers and customers will be required to wear masks, so no beard trimming or lip waxing.

AD

AD

In Virginia Beach on Friday, the beaches will be open to swimming and sunbathing. No group sports, alcohol, tents or large groups will be allowed, and parking areas will be limited to 50-percent capacity.

What about Northern Virginia?

The elected leaders in the region’s five largest jurisdictions — Fairfax, Prince William, Loudoun and Arlington counties, plus the city of Alexandria — asked Gov. Ralph Northam (D) to keep them shut down a while longer, and he agreed.

The region, which contains a third of Virginia’s population, has averaged nearly double the number of daily coronavirus-related deaths in recent days than the rest of the state, a Washington Post analysis of government data found.

AD

Though his executive order on a gradual reopening carries a May 28 deadline for Northern Virginia, Northam said he would allow the state’s economic engine to resist reopening for “as long as it takes.”

“This is about safety,” he said.

How many people are hospitalized?

In Virginia, 1,502 people with confirmed or probable cases of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, were hospitalized Monday, after 47 more were admitted since Sunday. On Monday, the rolling average of daily hospital admissions over five days was 60, compared with 82 the previous Monday. There were 361 covid-19 patients in intensive care units Monday, down from 396 in the past week.

What about hospital beds?

Virginia officials have said there are enough hospital beds to handle admissions through mid-June, with 4,389 still available Monday, according to the Virginia Hospital and Healthcare Association.

AD

AD

On Monday, 629 ventilators were being used, 21 percent of the state’s supply.

Does the state have enough personal protective equipment?

Last month, Virginia officials said the state had ordered 17.4 million respirator masks, 1 million face shields and 17 million pairs of gloves. No hospital in Virginia has reported difficulty in acquiring enough protective gear within a 72-hour period since May 8, down from a high of seven hospitals in mid-April, according to the state health department.

[The latest on reopening plans in the region: D.C. | Maryland]

What about coronavirus testing and the rate of infections?

The state initially prioritized testing for specific groups, such as those older than 65, first responders and people already showing flu-like symptoms. Facing criticism over Virginia’s low rate of testing, state officials began taking samples from residents in low-income areas and plan to test people with chronic diseases, expectant mothers, babies born to mothers with covid-19, and uninsured and underinsured residents, said Karen Remley, a former Virginia health commissioner who is helping the state with testing.

AD

AD

The average number of tests conducted increased from about 2,600 a day to more than 7,000 per day about a week ago before dropping to just over 5,800 on Monday. The state hopes to get to 10,000 tests per day.

As of Monday, 194,677 coronavirus tests had been conducted.

Northam’s office says the governor wants to see sustained declines in the rate of people testing positive. Last week, the state health department eliminated results from less-reliable antibody tests from that calculation, which had pushed the positivity rate slightly downward. The seven-day average of positive test results for Monday was 14.9 percent, up slightly from the past week’s 14 percent but still lower than a high of 22 percent in mid-April.

What about contact tracing?

The National Association of City and County Health Officials estimates states need about 15 to 30 contact tracers per 100,000 residents, the governor’s office says.

Larry Hogan (R) announced that people who have been exposed to the coronavirus but are not showing symptoms will be able to get tested at several state-run testing sites starting Thursday. No appointment or doctor’s referral will be needed. He also authorized store pharmacies to purchase and administer tests.

AD

Hogan has come under pressure recently from local leaders who say more people need to be tested before their regions can begin to reopen.

AD

“This will help doctors diagnose and treat new cases more quickly, and it will further increase the safety of our state for all citizens,” Hogan said in a statement.

D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) has set up two testing sites in the city, and is especially encouraging people who have symptoms, are front-line workers, live in institutional settings or are 65 or older to get tested.

And Prince William County offered free testing for all county residents Monday and Tuesday — no appointment or symptoms needed.

Yu Lihua, 90

Gaithersburg, April 30

Yu Lihua was one of the most important Chinese American writers of her day. She published more than two dozen books, the fruit of a fascination — and obsession — with writing that spanned 75 years. The work guided her and her mostly Chinese-speaking readers through heartbreak, divorce, struggles over identity and belonging, and questions of sex, sexism, friendship and family. She pushed herself, and those she loved, with a mantra she held onto from a grade-school teacher who read one of her early stories: “You can make something of yourself.” She died of covid-19 in a suburban Maryland retirement complex.

Washington, April 30

It was not unusual for Alyce Gullattee, a pioneering psychiatrist and devoted civil rights activist, to wander alone down alleys in Northwest Washington, at the height of the crack epidemic of the 1980s, searching for a patient she feared had overdosed. She would become one of the nation’s most respected experts on substance abuse in a career that spanned half a century at Howard University, where she spent a career serving as an associate professor of psychiatry and as director of the school’s Institute on Substance Abuse and Addiction. Before her death, Gullattee was the oldest faculty member at Howard.

Lawrence, 69, and Minnette Nokes, 71

Carroll County, April 15 and April 7

Lawrence Nokes was admitted to Carroll Hospital Center on March 30 and intubated. After about a week in a coma, his prognosis improved, his family recalled. He started to breathe on his own. When he regained consciousness, Nokes asked for just one person: Minnette, his wife of 24 years.

Minnette Nokes had died days earlier, on April 7, a day before her 72nd birthday, of a heart attack. The medical examiner’s office said she posthumously tested positive for the coronavirus. Once Lawrence Nokes found out, his breathing grew raspy again. He died on April 15, eight days after his wife.

Temple Hills, April 15

Michael Miller was rarely spotted alone. In the nine years he worked at the Silver Spring bus depot, he was most often seen in “a crowd of fellas,” and on summer weekends he hosted barbecues at his Temple Hills home, playing ’70s music while grilling ribs. There was nothing that pleased Miller more, said his wife, Donna Miller, than seeing the people around him having a good time. He was the first Montgomery County government employee to lose to his life to the disease.

That journey led him to a career with the U.S. Education Department’s Rehabilitation Services Administration, where he helped students with disabilities like his, and to a rich and busy life filled with friends and travel. Both were cut short on April 13 when Miller, who lived in Alexandria, Va., died of complications of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. He was 52 and otherwise healthy, his mother said.

Deon M. Crowell, 51

Washington, April 13

Deon M. Crowell had been in the D.C. jail since 2018, when he was charged with first-degree murder in the stabbing death of a D.C. woman. His was the first in-custody death attributed to covid-19 at the facility. His attorney had petitioned a D.C. Superior Court judge to have her client released as he awaited trial, arguing that Crowell’s diabetes and other health challenges associated with the disease put him at greater risk of contracting the coronavirus.

After a peak week of sheltering in place in early April, U.S. residents began to inch out of their homes, according to new cellphone data. But even as states begin to âopen up,â more Americans appear to be staying put than sprinting out the door.

See full methodology at bottom of article.

According to a Washington Post analysis of data provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates cellphone location information, the peak period of our collective, coronavirus-induced lockdown was the seven-day period ending April 7. (There was also a one-day spike on Easter Sunday.) During that time, U.S. residents spent a whopping 93 percent of their time at home, up from the early March averages of roughly 70 percent.

Some governors began relaxing restrictions meant to curb the spread of covid-19 at the end of April, after they were prodded by President Trump and cautioned by public health officials. But as of April 30, people were still at home an average of 89 percent of the time.

The numbers vary greatly by geography. People in some counties appear to barely leave their homes, especially in large metro areas, including hard-hit New York, Detroit and Chicago. People in areas that are less populated tend to leave a bit more, and residents in at least one very rural county in Arizona are approaching the amount of free-roaming time they enjoyed in early March.

To determine when people are home, SafeGraph obtains GPS data through regular pings from smartphones that are running one or more apps from an undisclosed list. (This type of tracking, which requires users to allow location data when they use certain apps, has rattled privacy experts. App users are often not aware that their data is being used by third-party companies.)

[Itâs the middle of the night. Do you know who your iPhone is talking to?]

The company defines âhomeâ as a common location from which a phone pings between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m. When the phone pings from elsewhere, SafeGraph assumes the phone is away from home.

Itâs not a perfect measure, but the data, aggregated from an average of 18 million phones per day, reveals broad insights.

Hereâs where people are going

Just because people are leaving their homes more doesnât mean theyâre flouting stay-at-home orders or that theyâve abandoned social distancing. They simply may be enjoying warmer weather outdoors, especially in places such as the Upper Midwest, which had an unseasonable April cold snap.

[Americans widely oppose reopening most businesses, Post-U. Md. poll finds]

Pings from phones within businesses and recreational areas show where people are â and arenât â showing up. Theyâre going to parks and grocery stores, according to Google data, which tracks users via their Google Accounts and compares their locations to a baseline from before stay-at-home orders were in place.

Park visits have trended upward recently.

Workplace visits, however, have not. The percentage of phones (and presumably, their owners) in workplaces dropped steeply in mid-March and has barely risen. More than 30 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in the past six weeks.

SafeGraphâs more granular data shows people are again hitting general merchandise stores such as Walmart and Target at near-March levels. Some are satisfying fast-food cravings at restaurants with counter service.

The data lines up with responses in a Washington Post-University of Maryland poll released May 5 in which more than half of people said they were comfortable visiting grocery stores, but 78 percent said they would not be comfortable eating at a sit-down restaurant, and 67 percent said they wouldnât be comfortable shopping in a clothing store. Only 18 percent of respondents were in favor of reopening movie theaters.

State orders donât necessarily dictate behavior

While governors have issued guidelines for reopening their states, businesses and customers have been slow to return in many locales.

One of the earliest states to relax restrictions was Georgia, where a group of southwestern counties are suffering through some of the highest per capita covid-19 death rates in the country. Gov. Brian Kemp (R) allowed spas, hair salons, tattoo parlors, bowling alleys and gyms to reopen on April 24. As of April 30, it did not appear that most Georgians immediately flocked out to get haircuts and hit weight rooms. On average, they were still staying home 86 percent of the time, compared with 92 percent at their early-April peak.

Some states are starting to leave home more than others

Share of time spent at home, for the seven-day period ending on each date

New Jersey South Dakota Select a state: Michigan

In New Jersey, second only to New York in covid-19 deaths, people are spending 96 percent of their time at home, just 1.7 percent less than at the peak. That is both the highest stay-home percentage and the smallest change of any state. Gov. Phil Murphy (D) reopened state parks and golf courses on May 2, but his stay-at-home order is still in effect.

Montanans, by contrast, are going out 10 percent more compared with the peak, the largest change in any state. The state has reported 456 covid-19 cases and 16 deaths as of May 5. Gov. Steve Bullock (D) has allowed retail and churches to reopen and will allow restaurants and schools to open May 7.

Alaskans and South Dakotans are spending the least time at home, 80 percent on average. South Dakota Gov. Kristi L. Noem was one of seven governors to never issue a stay-at-home order. The state has one of the largest coronavirus clusters in the country, at a Smithfield pork-producing plant in Sioux Falls.

Variations on how people move around within states are common and sometimes large, and they often â but not always â follow the pattern of virus outbreaks.

In Florida, people in the populous southern counties of Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach, where most of the stateâs covid-19 cases have been concentrated and where beaches remain closed, are spending about 4 percent more time away from home than in early April. But people in the adjacent counties of Collier and Monroe, which includes the Florida Keys, were out of their houses 13 percent more as of April 30 than at the peak.

[Where people have died of covid-19 by county]

Areas of Georgia around Atlanta showed almost no decrease, led by Forsyth County, which barely budged from its peak of 97 percent at home. By contrast, people in rural Dooly County in the central part of the state were going out 12 percent more than they had at their stay-home peak, despite having a covid-19 death rate that is 19 times higher than Forsythâs.

In Arizonaâs La Paz County, residents are away from home 25 percent more than they were at the peak â the largest change of any county in the country â and theyâre home just 57 percent of the time, roughly the same rate as in early March. In Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, the difference is just 4 percent off the peak, and as of April 30, people were still home 90 percent of the time.

In general, people in rural areas are away more than people in urban and suburban areas, in large part because stores, services and essential workplaces are much farther away and delivery services are rare or nonexistent. But the trend lines are very similar across all types of places.

The data clearly shows that when Americans were told it was time to stay home, most people did. It also indicates that they are deciding for themselves when to go back out.

About this story

Data for this story was provided by SafeGraph, a company that aggregates location data from tens of millions of devices and compares it with building footprints. The Post analyzed its social distancing metrics data set to estimate the share of time spent at home for each county.

The raw numbers fluctuate from day-to-day and county-to-county, and some counties have far fewer devices than others. To account for these challenges, we adjusted the device counts based on population and performed a multilevel regression using a random effects model on the county, state and national levels. Because people tend to leave their homes far more on weekdays than weekends, we chose to calculate a seven-day rolling average, which results in each âdayâ of data including five week and two weekend days.

This analysis relies on defining a âhomeâ location for every device. SafeGraph does this by finding the usual nighttime location of each device over the course of six weeks. It then buckets that location into a grid of roughly 150-meter-wide boxes across the country. When the device remains in that box, it is considered as being home. Of course this is not perfect, but in aggregate and at scale, SafeGraphâs at-home numbers track with other data sources, including location-data research published by other companies and public polling.

Urbanization figures are based on county designations from the National Center for Health Statisticsâs urban-rural classification scheme.

But even those of us who have been cheerleaders for the CDC’s role in keeping the United States and the world safe recognize the need for fixing this venerable institution.

It is reasonable to ask why the CDC was unable to quickly develop and scale up testing for SARS-CoV-2, the virus’s official name. Why was there no backup plan? How come SARS-CoV-2 circulation in many parts of the United States remained undetected by the CDC’s early warning systems for at least several weeks after January? Why did the CDC not take the lead in developing, or at least systematically collating, projection models for the pandemic’s spread, which would have decreased confusion among decision-makers and the public?

AD

If we want to avoid asking similar questions again the next time a new virus appears, the CDC needs some changes.

Over the years, there has been a substantial expansion in the types of activities the CDC is involved with. The federal agency whose original name was the Communicable Disease Center now deals with issues ranging from birth defects to injury prevention. Critics have charged that this expanded focus has resulted in dilution of the CDC’s outbreak response mission. The CDC should not ignore other health issues such as obesity and noncommunicable diseases. But it cannot afford to lose focus as the nation’s insurance policy against infectious disease threats.

Reform efforts should focus on increasing CDC’s infectious disease laboratory capacity and enhancing its expertise in scaling up testing during public health emergencies. One of the most effective ways to get ahead of outbreaks is to have a highly sensitive epidemiological surveillance system. CDC maintains several surveillance systems, but they were of limited utility as early warning systems for covid-19. CDC will have to reassess the data it acquires, how fast these data get transmitted and what analytical tools it uses to detect signals. CDC will also have to modernize the types of data it routinely uses. For example, rapidly sequencing and analyzing genomes of circulating viruses can provide important information, such as where the virus was imported from. To better prepare for fast-spreading outbreaks, CDC will have to expand the use of genomic epidemiology and other modern tools for surveillance.

AD

The CDC also badly needs more money, and Congress has to change the way it funds the agency. Public health investments yield very high returns: For every dollar spent on prevention, there is a five times return on investment within five years. Despite this, Congress has tried to fund public health on the cheap. As a result, the CDC has been chronically underresourced. For example, CDC’s Public Health Emergency Preparedness (PHEP) program that supports states and local areas in their preparations for pandemics and other emergencies has had its funding shrunk from $940 million in 2002 to $675 million in 2020. PHEP funds can be used to develop laboratory and contact-tracing capacity — which could have come in handy in this pandemic.

CDC’s programs are micromanaged by Congress through detailed line-item budgeting, which means lawmakers and their aides have undue influence over CDC priorities. A stroll through the CDC campus can be illustrative: You arrive at the (Rep. Edward R.) Roybal campus to check in at the (Sen.) Tom Harkin communications center to walk to the (Sen.) Arlen Specter Headquarters and Emergency Operations Center. The instinct to appease political leadership was criticized by the National Academy of Sciences during another infectious disease emergency — the smallpox bioterrorism threat in 2005. A nimble, evidence-driven CDC would require flexibility in resource allocation based on scientific acumen and experience of public health professionals, rather than ideological leanings of vested interests.

The Epidemic Intelligence Service (EIS), CDC’s flagship training program for its staff, needs to be modernized. This postdoctoral program trains CDC scientists in epidemiologic field work through a combination of classroom training and experiential learning. Career CDC leaders usually come from this cadre of staff; it is rare for a non-EIS-trained CDC staff to rise to the senior echelons.

EIS officers are trained in conventional methods for investigating and responding to outbreaks, such as fast-paced studies that compare exposures among those with illness labeled as “cases” and those without disease labeled as “controls.”

But the science of disease control has evolved substantially and now includes tools such as advanced mathematical modeling, genomic epidemiology and high-end laboratory methods. CDC does employ scientists with expertise in these and other emerging subfields. These skills are increasingly so seminal to modern disease control approaches, though, that they should be a major part of the core EIS training requirements. Moreover, EIS officers should be well-versed in the science of behavioral interventions — designing a smart social distancing strategy is as much about human behavior as it is about biological characteristics of the virus.

Just over a year ago in a U.S. Senate committee hearing, I was asked about the value of the CDC. Without hesitation, I described the CDC as a national treasure. I continue to believe this. And it is precisely because I have such faith in the abilities of the men and women of the CDC that I know we must reform this U.S. institution of global significance. We need it to be as excellent as it can be.

It’s unclear what share of the population is currently infected. Nor do we know how many have been exposed and developed antibodies, which would indicate how far we are from the approximately 70 percent necessary to attain herd immunity. This basic question has enormous influence on the pace at which society can confidently reopen — yet we are not even on a path to answers.

In at least a dozen states, testing capacity outstrips the supply of patients. Another approach is urgently needed.

No existing or planned covid-19 surveys meet the two fundamental conditions for testing results to reveal the true rate of spread.

First, the people invited to be tested must be representative of the general population. They should be drawn randomly. So far, much of what is known about U.S. cases comes from specialized populations: the sick and symptomatic, and essential workers. In Taiwan, 158 tests have been conducted for every confirmed case. In the United States, the rate is just eight and drawn largely from the groups mentioned above

Second, among those invited to be tested, those who show up must also be representative of the general population. Current approaches fall apart here because only a fraction of those able or invited to be tested follow through. The major covid-19 prevalence studies to date — Santa Clara, Iceland and even ongoing National Institutes of Health testing— have relied on the self-motivated or volunteers.

AD

The problem is that volunteers differ from people who choose not to volunteer in ways that cannot be readily observed. This is why reliable polling is not based on specialized populations, such as people who have a particular interest in a topic, but on random sampling from the general population. In terms of the pandemic, people who are sick or suspect that they have been exposed might be more likely to seek testing, such that volunteers’ rate of infection could exceed that of the general population. In the other direction, the very health-conscious might jump at the opportunity to be tested, and their rate of infection might be below average.

Unrepresentative testing cannot produce a reliable compass to guide policy. If testing is not mandatory, individuals decide whether the benefits outweigh the costs: if the information and contribution to the public good are worth physical discomfort, general hassle and the invasiveness of sharing health information. These are not small problems. In Iceland, only 33 percent of those invited to be tested for covid-19 took up the offer; two-thirds of those invited decided the costs outweighed the benefits and went untested.

There is, however, another option. If economics has taught us anything, it is that financial incentives can change behavior. Offering payments for completed tests could change the calculus of those invited to be tested.

AD

Some people might agree for $25. Some might follow through at $50 or $100. With each higher incentive, more people are likely to conclude that testing is worthwhile.

Absent the reliability of everyone being tested, plausible assumptions suggest it is possible to learn the infection rate in the general population by comparing how people’s infection rates vary with their willingness to be tested.

Governments could implement this approach inexpensively to learn about covid-19’s prevalence in their jurisdictions. Some colleagues and I are working to launch a program in Chicago, where we expect to determine a reliable measure of citywide prevalence with only 2,000 tests. We plan to draw a random sample of the population, invite the full sample to be tested and randomly offer incentives for completed tests.

This approach doesn’t require millions of tests or several hundred thousand contact tracers, averting privacy concerns. It is unhindered by shortages in testing supplies and protective equipment for those administering the tests.

Once launched, the tests could be repeated regularly to track how the disease evolves and even the protection offered by developing antibodies. The results could reliably be a guide to safely unlocking our economy. At lower rates of spread, partial reopenings could be based on data, not hope. And if we reach herd immunity, decision-making becomes easier.

Until we implement covid-19 testing that produces representative results, it is impossible to know the current prevalence of the disease or of past infection in the population. Policymakers need this information to navigate between the goals of protecting health and reopening the economy; without it, we all pay the cost in lives and livelihoods.

Better to pay smaller amounts, upfront, to encourage people to get tested.
