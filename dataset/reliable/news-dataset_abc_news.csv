“We assess conspiracy theories linking the spread of COVID-19 to the expansion of the 5G cellular network are inciting attacks against the communications infrastructure globally and that these threats probably will increase as the disease continues to spread, including calls for violence against telecommunications workers,” the U.S. Department of Homeland Security reported Wednesday in an intelligence report obtained by ABC News.

“Violent extremists have drawn from misinformation campaigns online that claim wireless infrastructure is deleterious to human health and helps spread COVID-19, resulting in a global effort by like-minded individuals to share operational guidance and justification for conducting attacks against 5G infrastructure, some of which have already prompted arson and physical attacks against cell towers in several US states,” the report concluded.

The assessment was followed on Thursday by a joint intelligence bulletin issued by the FBI, DHS and the National Counterterrorism Center. Both documents were distributed to senior federal officials and law enforcement agencies around the country.

The federal officials who wrote the DHS analysis could not be more pointed about the seriousness of their concerns, saying the bulletin was “intended to highlight targeting and attacks globally against critical infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic and advise of online threats against critical infrastructure made by individuals including domestic violent extremists in the United States and others possibly driven by conspiracy theories. Critical infrastructure has been a longstanding target of (domestic terrorists) and current targeting observed appears to be focused primarily on locations associated with the (5G network) and the electric grid.”

The conspiracy theory is totally bogus and has zero connection to legitimate science, according to numerous experts who have researched the question and have been interviewed by ABC News. Once confined to the fringe of the internet, the theory says coronavirus is caused or spread by 5G technology, which is being constructed throughout Western Europe and the US as a means of improving phone and computer communications.

Eileen Culloty, a researcher specializing in countering disinformation at Dublin City University, told ABC News last month that “theories about 5G have been around for years, but were mostly confined to the fringes… For some people, the dramatic upheaval of COVID-19 demands an equally dramatic explanation. That’s the core appeal of a conspiracy theory -- it reduces complexity and coincidence into a simple narrative and points at someone or something to blame.”

As the pandemic first began to appear outside of China early this year, fears were heightened among law enforcement when a series of cell towers around Britain were targeted in unexplained arson attacks. By mid-April officials in the UK and US agreed the attacks were likely the result of the online paranoia having jumped from the screen to the real world.

Similar incidents have now been reported in the U.S., according to the federal documents.

“Since December 2019, unidentified actors conducted at least five arson incidents targeting cell towers in Memphis, Tenn., that resulted in more than $100,000 in damages,” the DHS reports say. “Additionally, 14 cell towers in western Tennessee, between February and April, were purposely turned off by way of disabling their electrical breakers,"" according to separate DHS field intelligence reporting. In April, arsonists set fire to a major cell tower in Portland, Ore., damaging electrical components at the base of the structure.”

Internationally, incidents were also reported in Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, according to the documents obtained by ABC News. On top of that, union officials in England reported that “telecommunications workers have been threatened with physical violence in light of conspiracy theories linking 5G networks to the spread of COVID-19.”

The chatter about 5G towers boiled over into an April 22 Facebook posting that “encouraged individuals associated with anarchist extremist ideology to commit acts of sabotage by attacking buildings and 5G towers around the world…in furtherance of an ‘International Day of Sabotage,’” the bulletin said.

Videos have also been posted online, showing people how to damage or destroy cell towers, according to the bulletin.

While many try to dismiss internet craziness as words without significance, experts fear the arson incidents could become another conspiracy like “Pizzagate,” which circulated during the 2016 presidential election campaign. In that case, false allegations that a Washington, D.C., pizzeria was a front for a human-trafficking and a child-sex ring were spread online by a number of far-right commentators, leading ultimately to a shooting without injuries at the restaurant in 2016. The shooter later told authorities he went to the restaurant to rescue the “victims” he had heard about.

The 5G conspiracy, unlike Pizzagate, has attracted people from across the political and ideological spectrum, according to intelligence analysts.

“We are seeing more people spreading these conspiracies, but equally disturbing is that more Americans seem to be believing them,” said ABC News contributor John Cohen, who used to oversee DHS intelligence operations as the acting undersecretary of the department. “In some cases, those people that believe the conspiracy theories commit destructive and violent acts as a result. This can be dangerous.”",High,Left-center,USA,1

Medical professionals in 20 states and Washington D.C. are investigating more than 200 confirmed or suspected cases of a mysterious illness thought to be linked to the coronavirus and affecting children, according to a new ABC News survey of hospital and state health officials across the country. And while the unexplained syndrome is believed to be extremely rare, experts said they expect the number to grow.

Experts said the inflammatory syndrome, recently named by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), resembles toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, itself a rare inflammatory disease typically affecting children under the age of five, and has the potential to be deadly. At least three children have died with the syndrome in New York, where at least an additional 119 cases are under investigation, according to the New York State Department of Health.

While the CDC says the group of symptoms is ""associated with"" COVID-19, exact cause remains a mystery.

Many kids, though not all, who experience symptoms of MIS-C -- which include fever, rash, eye irritation, swollen lymph nodes and/or swelling of the hands and feet -- either have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or tested positive for the antibodies, said health experts. And doctors say even those that have tested negative for antibodies could test positive later because of the lag in antibody development.

According to the CDC, It typically takes one to three weeks after someone becomes infected with the novel coronavirus for their body to make antibodies, and some people could take longer than that.

The illness is only a small percentage of the 1.5 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. Dr. Courtney Gidengil, a pediatric infectious disease physician and a policy researcher at the thinktank RAND, said the syndrome is incredibly rare, and parent’s should not panic.

But Gidengil warned the U.S. should expect to see the number of reported cases of the mystery illness rise.

“It seems like it takes four to six weeks for [MIS-C] to develop after infection, not due to the virus itself but rather the body’s response to the illness,” Gidengil said. ""We probably will start to see it pop up more around the entire country.”

There is no current official tally of suspected incidents of the illness nationwide, but an ABC News survey of hospital and state health officials in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. found at least 220 confirmed or possible cases of the illness. The majority of possible cases have been reported in New York, but more than a dozen have also been reported in New Jersey and Michigan, and officials said they also saw potential cases in Massachusetts, Washington D.C., Connecticut, California, Utah, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington State, Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri, Georgia and Minnesota.

Some other states like Maryland and North Carolina have told ABC News they don’t have any confirmed cases but are monitoring for any suspected cases.

""I'll wager that's going to only go up and it's going to be much more widespread than anyone thinks,"" New York's Cuomo said.

The CDC sent a warning Thursday to thousands of doctors to be on the lookout for the illness, which was previously known as pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome, or PMIS. Friday the government agency said that surveillance of the disease ""is limited,"" but ""now that the case definition and [a health alert] are out, more info is likely to follow.""

Health departments across the country said they have already been on the lookout. Doctors in the U.K., Italy and Spain reported an increase in cases there last month.

The Michigan health department sent out an alert earlier this month to local health agencies and health care providers about the disease and a reminder to report suspected cases within 24 hours. To date, there are 17 suspected cases under review in the state, Michigan health department spokesperson Lynn Sutfin told ABC News. New Jersey, which has reported a total of 18 cases as of Wednesday, sent out their own alert earlier this month as well.

A doctor in Oregon told ABC News proper knowledge about the illness allowed an afflicted eighth grader to get treatment immediately, which ultimately helped save her.

""I'm very grateful because I could have been gone,"" 14-year old Leah said in an interview with ABC . ""I'm glad I got help right away.""

In California, the state has yet to declare the syndrome a reportable illness, but hospitals have been paying close attention as early as March. Dr. Jim Stein, chief medical officer at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, said the illness is a sign that the impact of the novel coronavirus is extending to children in a way that “this is no longer considered necessarily less significant for children than it is for adults.”

The CDC alert said that “It is currently unknown if multisystem inflammatory syndrome is specific to children or if it also occurs in adults.”

But little is known about the illness' connection to COVID-19.

Of the 16 children with inflammatory symptoms in California, 14 have been tested for coronavirus antibodies, Stein said. None of them had tested positive for the coronavirus detection at the time they were admitted to the hospital, but four of them tested positive later. Stein added that the 10 patients that tested negative could also develop antibodies later.

Dr. Andrew Pavia, who has been monitoring two suspected cases at the University of Utah Health Primary Children’s Hospital, said treatments given to patients with the toxic shock related symptoms could also interfere with antibody tests for COVID-19, further complicating the efforts to identify any link between the two.

Health experts are also going back to their current and past patients as they examine more patients and the case definition of the illness broadens from the classic Kawasaki disease, which could increase the number of cases brought forth.

“There's just a lot to worry about with respect to kids,” Alker said. “We really need a national strategy we need our leaders to sort of thoughtfully consider and address this wide range of threats that children face right now to their health and development.”

“And unfortunately there's just no sign that exists right now,” Alker added.

With new illness, questions about summer camps, schools re-opening

The sudden rise in critically ill children, albeit extremely small nationwide, has only further ignited the debate surrounding reopening, especially when it comes to schools.

Most states have decided that school openings will occur on a local level, and for nearly the entire country that decision still hangs in the balance. But the start of summer camps and summer programs is just around the corner, and many states have already moved to allow them to go on. States including Georgia, Tennessee, and Connecticut all have possible cases of MIS-C they have been monitoring in their state but have said summer camps may reopen with various forms of social distancing in place.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, repeatedly warned lawmakers during a hearing on Tuesday about opening schools and businesses too soon, which he said could cause further outbreaks.

“We don't know everything about this virus and we really better be very careful particularly when it comes to children,"" Dr. Fauci warned.

But some lawmakers have been quick to dismiss the warnings, eagerly pushing to open schools in the fall, which are seen as a major indicator of the country being officially opened.

Sen. Rand Paul, R- Kentucky, pushed back on Fauci's calls for cautiousness and said it would be a “huge mistake” not to let kids return to school sooner. President Trump also told reporters Wednesday that he was “surprised” by Fauci’s comments. He said it was “not an acceptable answer.”

""I think that we have to open our schools,"" Trump said in an interview on Wednesday. ""Young people are very little affected by this. We have to get the schools open.""

In Connecticut, where Gov. Ned Lamont and hospitals have recently confirmed that at least five children in the state are being monitored and treated for the new syndrome, the state’s Office of Early Childhood announced this week that summer camps, with the exception of overnight camps, can open on June 29 with specific guidance in place, including a requirement to get a permission to host a group more than 30 as well as other social distancing measures. When schools can reopen there remains a question, as Education Commissioner Miquel Cardona said this week that the school reopening plan will depend on infection trends and that they will need to be flexible.

Georgia Gov. Kemp has implemented a similar measure. Summer camps were permitted to begin operating this week, as long as they follow 32 mandatory criteria that his team developed in absence of the CDC’s guidance. Overnight camps are prohibited. Kemp's office did not respond to a request for comment about how the new illnesses in the state would impact his decisions about schools moving forward.

In most other states, some summer camps are opening up while some other camps are choosing to remain closed amid state governments’ lack of state-wide directives.

In Maryland, Montgomery County this week went ahead and cancelled all summer camps in the county as it awaits for state health department's guidance for camps. Guidance on summer camps is pending in Michigan and Massachusetts as well, while Missouri has left it to counties and cities to decide on the fate of summer camps.

In Utah, the Girl Scouts of Utah has extended the cancellation of “in-person meetings for troops and services of units” until June 30, but YMCA of Northern Utah is moving ahead with its camps while adhering to CDC social distancing guidelines. Schools remain closed through the end of the academic year.

An 'additional risk to consider'

Early concerns about re-opening schools had more to do with the possibility of children potentially transmitting the coronavirus to their teachers, parents or elderly grandparents, who have shown to be much more susceptible to COVID-19's more serious effects.

Pavia said that the new ""scary illness"" affecting kids, while very rare, has only added to the difficult safety calculations.

“I think it's one more factor to put into the very complex decision making about letting kids go back to school in the fall or the summer camps,” Pavia said. “We know that overall they're likelihood of getting severe respiratory disease is very low. We think that MIS-C is a rare but very serious complication, and you know how it's hard to make decisions about rare but serious events.”

“I think for schools, it's just an additional risk to consider,” Pavis added. “I still think that for deciding whether to open schools, the bigger concern is what role children may play in prolonging the epidemic and infecting older people. That's likely to be a much larger impact in terms of numbers. Psychologically, this may have a bigger role.”

In the meantime, health experts are urgently trying to get the word out about the disease so parents can know identify and get their children medical attention as soon as possible.

“Parents: know the signs of Pediatric Multi-Symptom Inflammatory Syndrome to protect your child,” New York City blasted out in its text-message notification system on Friday.

""This is truly disturbing,"" Gov. Cuomo said of the illness at a press conference this week. ""We raise it because it's something parents should be aware of.""

Recommendations on how to protect ourselves from contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 are everywhere, like washing your hands, wearing a mask, and staying at least 6 feet away from people outside your home. But not all risks are created equal; home, public transportation and the grocery store all have different challenges.

A blog post by University of Massachusetts Dartmouth professor, Dr. Erin Bromage, who studies immunity of infectious diseases in animals, titled ""The Risks - Know Them - Avoid Them"" garnered major attention for showing that some of the highest risk areas may not be what you'd expect.

A lot of attention is being spent on opening up the economy, but it seems like the highest risk is more likely your own living room.

The data suggests that most people will get infected in their home, according to Bromage.

Tune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.

So where are the highest risk areas in the community for getting infected?

""The general theme of what I can see is, lots of people together in an enclosed environment with poor airflow and usually some sort of talking or singing involved leads to lots of people in that environment getting infected,"" said Bromage, in an interview with ABC News.

Case studies that traced back COVID-19 outbreaks at the beginning of the pandemic, have found that the main sources of infections in the community lead back to the workplace, public transportation, social gatherings, and restaurants — indoor environments, with limited air circulation, and many people spending a prolonged period of time in the same place.

Some of the biggest outbreaks, excluding nursing homes, in fact, that have been reported and traced occurred in prisons, religious ceremonies, choir practices, indoor sporting events, and even birthday parties.

""You've got a lot of people in an enclosed space with lots of huffing, puffing, or yelling, which just led to large outbreak events,"" Bromage said.

Being exposed to the virus does not automatically mean you will be infected. A successful infection is dependent on the time exposed to the virus and the amount of viral particles you are exposed to. For example, ""While joggers may be releasing more virus due to deep breathing, remember the exposure time is also less due to their speed,"" Bromage writes.

Scientists call the amount of exposure to the virus that leads to infection the ""infectious dose."" Although scientists are still learning more about how many viral particles lead to infection, they do know that sneezing and coughing release the highest amount of viral material into the air, and you're more likely to become infected if you're in a confined space.

A single sneeze, according to Bromage, has been estimated to release about 30,000 droplets that can travel up to 200 miles per hour, which means it could easily cross a room. A cough releases round 3,000 droplets that can travel around 50 miles per hour. These particles may drop to the ground or could hang around in the air for a short period of time.

In fact, a recently published study showed that speaking loudly in an enclosed space creates ""substantial"" risk of transmitting the virus to others. Prolonged contact and lots of direct talking, breathing, and yelling between individuals increases the direct exposure to viral particles, which increases the likelihood for infection.

The amount of virus a person release changes over the course of the infection and varies by person. This is dependent on the infected persons' viral load, which is the amount of the virus detected in a test sample from a patient and reflects how well the virus is replicating.

Many people are asymptomatic and may easily spread the virus, unknowingly, by directly talking, singing, yelling, or even breathing around other people in close contact. This is why the CDC advises that everyone wear face coverings in public.

Bromage underscores that the exact number of people infected by respiratory droplets versus transmission through touching contaminated objects like door handles and elevator buttons is unknown, which is why it's also important to wash your hands often and avoid touching your face. But the compilation of studies he wrote, ""serves to highlight that being in an enclosed space, sharing the same air for a prolonged period increases your chances of exposure and infection.""

In very high-risk situations, social distancing guidelines are not as effective because even if you are far away from an infected individual in a small, poorly ventilated enclosed space for a long period of time, a low dose of the virus in the air can reach you and over a sustained period of time may be enough to cause infection.

Bromage said that the activities many typically view as highest risk for infection like grocery shopping might not be as risky if you're spending a brief amount of time at the store, you're avoiding other shoppers, not speaking directly with people, and the store restricts the number of people that can enter at a given time.

Public bathrooms may also pose a risk, but for slightly different reasons, said Bromage. Bathrooms have a lot of high touch surfaces like door handles, faucets, and countertops.

So far, the science seems to suggest that outdoor areas and large ventilated spaces are the lowest risk areas for infection. Outdoor areas are generally safer because wind and infinite air space could dilute the viral particles circulating. If you are actively moving outside that also reduces the exposure time to any viral particles hanging around.

With restrictions lifted in some states, many Americans will face a new challenge: ""Just because something is open doesn't mean it is an instruction to go,"" said Dr. Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health at UC Irvine.

Before you put yourself in a high-risk situation, Bromage suggests asking yourself, ""Are there too many people here and how much time have they spent here? Are there loud talkers? Singing or yelling? What's the amount of people in my area that actually are infected?"" If you are in an environment with a lot of people, you should also assess what changes the business owner put in place to lower the risk of virus spreading.

If you choose to meet other people, you should also consider their level of exposure and health status. Ask your friends or family where they have been, how often they go to the store and whether they have been staying home, suggests Dr. Henry Raymond, epidemiologist and associate professor at Rutgers University.

""It's not just about your health but about the health of those people around you,"" Raymond said.

If you know your friend or relative has underlying health conditions or is at an increased risk of developing severe symptoms due to a weaker immune system you should take extra precautions to avoid exposing them to the virus. If your state permits social gatherings and you decide to meet up, keep it to a small group and make it safe as possible by staying outside, Raymond said. Agree on some ground rules, such as: ""We don't shake hands, we bring our own food, we space the chair out at least 6 feet away.""

""The best course of action is to be personally cautious and personally responsible. We don't have a vaccine. But we do have social distancing and masks,"" said Raymond.

Texas has seen a steady rise in novel coronavirus cases and fatalities since reopening just over two weeks ago.

There are now 45,198 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services. That is an increase of 1,347 cases from Thursday to Friday. The new numbers have not yet been recorded for Saturday.

Last Friday, the daily case increase was 1,219.

While the cases are still well below New York, the state with the most confirmed cases at more than 345,000, the steady increase shows that the curve has not yet flattened in Texas.

The state also experienced its highest and second-highest daily death toll just a day apart. On Thursday, 58 deaths were recorded in 24 hours and Friday that number dropped only slightly to 56, according to the health department. The total number of fatalities is at 1,272.

Last Friday, the daily death toll was 31.

Hospitalizations rates have appeared to flatten, but that data is reported on a two-week lag. Currently there are 1,716 people in a Texas hospital, according to the health department.

Gov. Greg Abbott's communications director John Wittman told ABC News that the amount of testing has doubled since reopening, contributing to the rise in cases.

""Since [COVID-19 testing] started, we did 330,000 tests in March and April. Since May 1, we have done over 330,000 -- so in 16 days we have doubled our testing from the previous entire two months,"" Wittman said.

""The governor has been clear that as the state of Texas conducts more tests, we will see the raw number of cases rise,"" Wittman said. ""However, the [rolling seven-day] average positivity rate has steadily declined from our high April 13 [of a bit more than 13%] to around 5% today. Our hospitalizations remain steady, and Texas has one of the lowest death rates per capita in the nation.""

Texas began reopening after its stay-at-home order was lifted on April 30.

Restaurants are open for in-person dining at 25% capacity. Movie theaters and malls are also open at 25% capacity.

Retail stores, libraries and museums are fully open. Come Monday, gyms will reopen too.

The two most populous counties -- Harris and Dallas -- have recorded the most cases. There are 8,817 confirmed cases in Harris County and 6,837 confirmed cases in Dallas County.

The state has tested nearly 646,000 people out of a population of 29 million. Cases are most likely higher because of how few people have been tested.

A total of 2,981,000 more Americans filed for unemployment insurance last week, bringing the total number of jobless claims filed amid the coronavirus pandemic to more than 36 million, according to the Department of Labor.

Since late March, millions of Americans have lost their jobs as states shuttered their economies to stop the virus's spread. New unemployment filings peaked at a staggering 6.9 million in the week ending March 28. Weekly unemployment filings still remain in the millions even as the number of Americans filing has been slowly decreasing.

As restrictions around the coronavirus caused restaurants across the country to halt dine-in service, many people staying at home turned to food delivery apps.

Wendy Reynolds, a 34-year-old food delivery driver in Elkhart, Indiana, has seen a big increase in orders. Before the COVID-19 crisis, Reynolds said that on average a food delivery driver in Indiana could make about $400 for a relaxed 40-hour workweek. Since COVID-19, she said that has gone up to $700 or $800 a week.

“Our orders have more than tripled and it seems like people are turning more to this delivery as the stay-at-home orders are put into place,” Reynolds told ABC News.

While working as a delivery driver at the height of the pandemic, Reynolds made the decision to stay in Airbnb rentals and hotels, paying up to $600 a week for a room to sleep in.

“The hardest part personally would just have to be the isolation that I've experienced from my children,” Reynolds said. “I have two daughters. They aren't with me during all of this because I'm afraid of it. I'm afraid that I would give them something that would get infected and somehow infect them.”

Although business is booming, Reynolds has found herself working exhausting 14-hour days and facing new challenges. As the demand for takeout and delivery has increased, Reynolds said sometimes she now has to wait in long drive-thru lines to pick up orders.

“That order can only be $4 and we're waiting for 15 cars to get up there to get our order, and then we have to still drive it 15 minutes away,” Reynolds said. “So it's hard. You have to work all day or night to make it.”

Reynolds has also had to adjust to no-contact deliveries, which means she has limited interaction with both restaurants and customers.

“When you come up and you give them their food, there's interaction and that just all stopped,” she said.

While out making deliveries, she has struggled to find somewhere to use the restroom without having to travel all the way back to her current Airbnb or hotel. Usually, she could go into restaurants or gas stations and use their restrooms, but now these restrooms are often closed.

Although gas prices have gone down due to the current crisis, Reynolds said the amount of driving she is doing is resulting in increased wear and tear on the car. To work as a delivery driver, she said she is constantly buying tires and doing repairs. In the past few months, she said she has spent over $5,000 on her car in repairs alone.

In audio diaries she recorded, Reynolds talks about how the coronavirus pandemic has affected her life and work as a food delivery driver. Her personal story can be heard in this week’s episode of the ABC News podcast “The Essentials: Inside the Curve.”

Before her life changed due to the pandemic, Reynolds would host shows to share her art and the rocks she collects, such as geodes and agates. This hobby has been meaningful to her since her first experience hosting an art show.

'It was just for me to sell my art and it was just a beautiful setting and I just remember feeling that night, like, this is a great moment. 'Tonight's a great moment for me,'"" Reynolds said.

As the future remains uncertain due to the coronavirus, Reynolds has been worrying about when the crisis will end and whether she will be able to safely hand out sack lunches to the homeless again. It's a volunteer activity that she does every summer with her two daughters, who are 15 and 12 years old. She said it’s important for her to teach her children to give to those who are in need.

Wendy Reynolds says she usually makes sack lunches for the homeless every year. Wendy Reynolds

“In my life, I've had ... my ups and downs just like anyone else, and I have found myself out about and needing, and being a person in need,” Reynolds said. “You see people out there on the side of the road hungry, laying down, sleeping on the side of the road. And my kids, you know, they don't understand, but their mother has been there.”

Reynolds recently made the decision to return home to her daughters, where they are taking small steps to being together again while still avoiding close contact.

“I needed to be around some people, mentally,” she said. “I'm happy that I'm back around them and I'm just glad that I'm not alone now.”",High,Left-center,USA,1

Massachusetts, praised by public health officials for being one of the first states to set up a coronavirus contact tracing program, is running into a problem: people aren’t picking up their phones.

When investigators reached out to infected residents and those with whom they came into close contact, more than half of their calls were being ignored, health officials revealed in recent a press briefing with Gov. Charlie Baker.

“If you get a call or a text from your local board of health or the COVID Team, it’s vital you take that call,” Baker said at the May 7 news conference, though state officials said the numbers have since improved.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said her state has faced the same problem.

""I know a lot of you don't answer the phone when you see an unknown caller reaching in, but I implore you to answer the call if it comes,"" she said at an April 20 news conference.

Experts have long said that along with robust coronavirus testing, contact tracing -- the detective work of searching backward from a positive coronavirus case for everyone who might've been exposed to it -- on a massive scale is key to a safer reopening of the country.

Starting with people who test positive for COVID-19, tracers, with a series of carefully worded questions, figure out who a person was in contact with a few days before their symptoms started – skillfully reconstructing their schedules from sometimes hazy memories to map out a detailed chain of potential COVID-19 transmission.

They then follow up with that person's close contacts, alerting those who may have been exposed to COVID-19, all without ever revealing the identity of patient zero.

But across the country, the growing number of coronavirus contact tracers are struggling to reach some residents who may have been exposed and, therefore, could be spreading the disease, public health officials in several states told ABC News.

While it’s not clear how many Americans are ignoring contact tracing calls – a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) spokesperson said the agency is not gathering data on the subject from the states – any spike in missed connections could delay efforts to quickly notify people and limit the spread of the virus in communities beginning to loosen restrictions, public health officials and experts told ABC News.

“When you miss anyone, and your contact tracing is incomplete, then you are at risk of ongoing transmission,” said Capt. Eric Pevzner, the chief of the CDC's Epidemic Intelligence Service, the country’s premier public health investigation program.

In interviews with ABC News, health officials offered a variety of explanations for why people aren’t answering phone calls from contact tracers, from robocall fatigue to concerns over privacy to a general mistrust of the system.

“It’s a trend we need to watch,” said Dr. Crystal Watson, a senior associate at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, in light of the “truly unprecedented” scale of contact tracing being done.

“It’s going to take a really impressive amount of cooperation and buy-in from the public to do this,” she said.

A consequence of endless robocalls

At a time when Americans are bombarded with more than 58 billion robocalls a year, and fraudsters are using the coronavirus to target potential victims in phone calls and text messages, many people are reluctant to field unexpected calls from unknown numbers.

“We’re hearing more and more from local health departments that have ramped up contact tracing, if citizens, if community members are seeing the Health Department on their phone, they’re really reluctant to provide information,” said Lori Tremmel Freeman, the CEO of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, which represents nearly 3,000 local health departments across the country.

Before the coronavirus pandemic, local health officials performing contact tracing to track down food-borne illness and sexually transmitted disease outbreaks would be responsible for placing calls.

But with many states partnering with private companies and nonprofits to expand their coronavirus contact tracing efforts, some calls are being made from numbers that trace back to local health departments -- meaning the people who may already have been reluctant to answer are more likely to assume it's a robocall, a telemarketer or some other kind of sales pitch.

“We’re in a time in the United States when there’s a ton of spam phone calls,” John Welch of Partners in Health, the nonprofit working with the state on their contact tracing program, said at the press conference with Baker last week. “If they are worried about a scam, have folks call us back.”

To address the problem, Massachusetts is working with telephone companies to make sure their contact tracers are identified as “MA COVID TEAM” on any call in hopes the more official-sounding identification will convince people the call is legitimate.

The state has also launched a public service announcement campaign to promote the effort help residents understand what to expect from a potential phone call.

State health officials told ABC News Friday the outreach, along with some new tracing communication strategies, has recently brought their ""connection rates"" to above 60%, including 67.9% for May 11. The officials said that through the middle of the week, the state's effort has reached more than 34,000 people -- 18,936 confirmed cases and 15,889 of their contacts.

Some communities wary of giving health investigators personal info

But even if the recipient recognizes a legitimate government entity, sometimes that's a problem too. In some communities, contact-tracing response rates also appear to reflect larger concerns about what health authorities could do with the information they're given.

“In general, people are wary of sharing personal information with strangers or with people from government,” said Dr. Richard Besser, the president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and former acting director of the CDC.

“Many of the groups that are being hardest hit -- black Americans, Latinos, Native Americans -- have had poor experiences with government officials and many have had poor experience with public health,” said Besser, who also previously served as chief health and medical editor for ABC News.

Freeman, who is in contact with hundreds of counties conducting contact tracing each day, said that communities with large immigrant populations have struggled in some cases to reach undocumented immigrants who have come in contact with people infected with COVID-19.

“Because of some of the fear created already in our country around immigration and legal status, there are some we simply will never reach because they’re fearful that the information will be used to somehow track them"" by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, she told ABC News.

In Maryland’s Anne Arundel County outside of Baltimore, public health workers have made community outreach a priority in their contact tracing by adding translators to their staff, and making sure all their informational handouts are available in Spanish.

The county has also increased outreach to African-American and Hispanic community leaders, to help encourage residents to participate, according to Jennifer Schneider, the deputy director of the health department’s bureau of disease prevention and management.

“There is some mistrust, and we battle with that in public health in general, for the communities to trust the government,” she said. “Immigration status is not a requirement for being tested. We just try to get that messaging out as much as we can and often.”

While the county, which has over 2,500 cases of COVID-19, says it has reached roughly 95% of traced contacts, Schneider said they are concerned about that figure rising as the state begins to ease out of its lock-down, and residents begin interacting with more people.

“We may have to pivot our operations to better find those individuals. That is a concern that we do have,” she said.

The emerging role of technology

In some parts of the country, local public health officials are using technology to reach residents who favor other forms of communication over phone calls.

In Chicago, the city launched Chi COVID Coach to allow the health department to communicate directly with Chicago residents via text message, and provide them with resources on testing and symptoms.

“Let’s not make the choice between tech and people, we need both,” Raed Mansour, Director of Innovation at the Chicago Department of Public Health, told ABC News. “In contact tracing, you need to meet people where they are.”

In many places, that has included text messaging for those who are less likely to answer calls.

""Texting is another way we are letting people know they are trying to reach them,"" Pevznar, the CDC official, told ABC News.""We find people tend to be more receptive to text. Text is a valuable tool.""

Perhaps most importantly, however, experts also urged for a more robust public awareness campaign to encourage people to participate.

That effort could help address problems some tracers have faced when they finally do successfully get in touch with people.

One of the newer unexpected problems some tracers are seeing is nearly an existential one: a lost sense of time.

Some people have struggled to piece together their schedules, after weeks of stay-at-home orders in certain regions, public health officials told ABC News.

Since your life has been disrupted, you don’t have those things to pin your memory to. People’s days tend to blend together,” said Pevznar.

Then, there are those who make contact tracing exponentially difficult by flouting quarantine measures. Sara Bosse, the health director in California’s rural Madera County, said that her team has checked in on asymptomatic residents infected with COVID-19 who have stopped complying with stay-at-home restrictions.

“As the weather has gotten warmer, we’ve noticed that people want to be outside and go places and do things,” she told ABC News.

Dr. Philip Huang, the director of the Health and Human Services department in Dallas County, Texas, said it's important to get people to understand why they need to isolate and self-quarantine if contacted, even if they don't have symptoms.

""People need to be responsible. It’s actually caring for the community and caring for others – it may be someone's mother or someone’s grandmother,"" he said. ""It does affect us all.""

When Ken Gregersen, 88, left his wife's nursing home in Ankeny, Iowa, on March 11, he didn't know that that would be the last time he'd see her for two months.

""I got an email, or I got notified by the care facility that no longer could I visit her. So I haven't actually seen her then since March,"" he told ABC News.

Evie, his wife of 67 years, is in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease and receives hospice care. Just like thousands across the country, her nursing home closed its doors to visitors amid the coronavirus outbreak.

The COVID-19 pandemic has rocked long-term care facilities. State data analyzed by ABC News reveals that almost a third of coronavirus deaths come from nursing homes.

With nearly half of all long-term care facility residents living with Alzheimer's or dementia, individuals with the disease have become one of the most disproportionately impacted groups from COVID-19 in the country.

As coronavirus-related deaths continue to climb, some observers have raised alarms that not enough is being done to protect Alzheimer's and dementia patients and those in long-term care facilities.

""Given some of the numbers that have now emerged, it's pretty clear that we did not have and probably still today don't have what would be full transparency on an accurate and timely basis about where the cases are occurring,"" Alzheimer's Association CEO Harry Johns told ABC News.

Alzheimer's, a chronic neurodegenerative disease, itself, does not make someone more vulnerable to coronavirus. However, those with the illness are more susceptible because they are usually older and/or have co-morbidities. Living in nursing homes also heightens the COVID-19 exposure risk for Alzheimer's and dementia patients.

Still, health concerns are not the only extra burden these individuals carry amid the outbreak. The enforced separation of nursing home residents from their families and loved ones may only increase the hardship.

""Depending on the degree of progression of the disease, someone with Alzheimer's may not understand what's going on,"" Johns said.

""[They] may not understand then why they can't leave the house. Why the kids are at home and extended family. Those kinds of confusions can, in and of themselves create challenges for the individual who has dementia, as well as for those carers,"" he added.

Johns says he believes current public health circumstances impact those with Alzheimer's more than other care home residents.

""For any resident that family contact is so important if someone is ill. But for Alzheimer's, people who have dementia, it is especially difficult because the connections to family can -- when someone has progressed -- keep them grounded,"" Johns told ABC News.

Coronavirus has also forced families of individuals living with Alzheimer's and dementia to navigate not seeing their loved ones for extended periods of time.

""It's not enjoyable at all. I don't know the right emotional words to say. I really do miss her. We're a very close couple, we've been married this long. We've had a wonderful marriage,"" Ken Gregersen said.

Ken's wife, Evie, moved to her nursing home in 2016 after her Alzheimer's diagnosis in 2012. Before the coronavirus outbreak, he would visit his wife three times a day.

""I would go over there and give her her breakfast. And then I'd go back and give her her lunch, and then I also (went) back to give her her dinner in the evening. And that's when I usually stayed a few minutes extra and I'd walk her around in her wheelchair and sing a song to her. And so I could then go from being her caregiver to being her husband again,"" he said.

While Evie's nursing home ended visits, Ken still talks to his wife every weekday on FaceTime. He said as Evie's condition deteriorates -- she can no longer open her eyes or speak -- he worries about many unknowns.

""Every day, when I see her FaceTime, and I talk to her and I try to tell her, what's going on in my life, or what are our children or grandchildren are doing, I always wonder does she hear me? Does she understand me? Does she miss me? You know, it makes me very anxious,"" he added.

Although Evie's nursing home has reported no patients or caregivers testing positive for coronavirus, Ken still worries what could happen if his wife contracts the virus.

""I know that I'm going to lose her someday. I mean I'm prepared for that. I think people who are taking care of someone with Alzheimer's, they start through the grieving process long before death occurs,"" he said.

""I know it's going to occur, but I don't want her to suffer. And the COVID virus ... it looks like there's a lot of suffering going on, you know, gasping for air and being so uncomfortable. That worries me,"" he added.

Ken says he's satisfied with the precautions Evie's nursing home has taken. However, as coronavirus cases rise in long-term care facilities, there have been calls for states and the federal government to do more to protect care facilities.

This week, the Alzheimer's Association announced new policy recommendations to fight coronavirus in long-term care facilities.

Johns identifies increased transparency, testing and personal protective equipment (PPE) as critical in fighting the disease at nursing homes, and helping to get to a point where family members can visit their loved ones.

""We believe it takes these multiple approaches. That PPE will make a difference, but if you don't have the testing, then you can't prevent the outbreaks. If you don't have the transparency, you can't deal rapidly enough with the outbreaks. So, it is the dynamic combination of doing these things that we believe is most crucial,"" Johns said.

""It is the dynamic of all of these things happening to improve people's lives, save people's lives and really, relieve the burden that is so present for people who care for those with Alzheimer's and other dementia,"" he added.

On Monday, President Donald Trump's administration also called for increased coronavirus testing with Vice President Mike Pence telling governors he wants to see every state prioritize COVID-19 screening inside the facilities.

However, those guidelines do not go as far as those of the Alzheimer's Association.

But until those guidelines are met, people continue to wait to visit their loved ones living in long-term care facilities. Meanwhile, family members, like Gregersen, settle for seeing their parents, spouses and friends' faces confined to portable screens.

""Thank goodness the hospice caregivers who come in set up a FaceTime event Monday to Friday so that I get a chance to see [Evie's] face. She no longer opens her eyes, but I'd like to think that she hears my voice. And I'd like to think she recognizes it,"" Gregerson said.

KAMPALA, Uganda -- Burundi is pushing ahead with an election on Wednesday that will end the president's divisive and bloody 15-year rule.

When President Pierre Nkurunziza hands over power, it could be the first truly peaceful transfer of authority in the East African nation since independence in 1962.

But the coronavirus poses a threat to the May 20 vote. Burundi has kicked out World Health Organization workers after concerns were raised. The WHO Africa director messaged the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief about political rallies the day that Burundi's campaigning launched and images of crowds circulated online.

Authorities have been accused by critics of downplaying the pandemic and citing divine protection. But the government appears to be using virus measures to limit election observers, warning the East African regional bloc on May 8 that arriving foreigners face a 14-day quarantine.

More than the virus, however, it's the fear of violence that weighs on many of the more than 5 million people eligible to vote.

Government agents have been accused of harassing the main opposition party, the CNL, whose leader Agathon Rwasa is believed to be in a close race with Nkurunziza's chosen successor in the ruling CNDD-FDD, Evariste Ndayishimiye.

More than 145 CNL members have been arrested since campaigning began on April 27, according to SOS Medias Burundi, a group of independent journalists. Police spokesman Pierre Nkurikiye has accused Rwasa of making “incendiary and defamatory” remarks and inciting revolt.

Rwasa, the deputy parliament speaker, has drawn large crowds despite the risks of openly supporting him, according to an online group of activists known as i-Burundi.

The group worries that a rigged election could spark the kind of street demonstrations that marked the previous vote in 2015.

“The ruling party was hoping to use this post-Nkurunziza election to gain a semblance of legitimacy, but given what’s happening we might end up with more violence,” i-Burundi said in an interview. “People want change. ... But the ruling party has the incumbent advantage and controls the electoral process.”

Rwasa told The Associated Press he feels it's important not to boycott the election even if the outcome is not expected to be fair.

“Everything has its right time,"" he said. “Right now, it is not the time to give up and abandon our people.""

Ndayishimiye, a retired general, would be a weak president because he will be a front for Nkurunziza and other powerful ruling party members, said David Gakunzi, a Burundian political analyst: “He consults but he will fear to take independent decisions.”

Ndayishimiye fought alongside Nkurunziza as a rebel in the civil war from 1993 to 2005 that killed about 300,000 people. Nkurunziza was chosen by lawmakers to be president during the peace process known as the Arusha Accords, which specified that a president's term can be renewed only once.

But Nkurunziza, who won a second term in 2010, said he was eligible for a third term in 2015 because he had not been chosen the first time by universal suffrage.

The deadly turmoil that followed badly damaged ties with the international community, and Burundi became the first country to leave the International Criminal Court after it started investigating allegations of abuses. The U.N. human rights office reported more than 300 extrajudicial killings and was kicked out of the country.

Nkurunziza survived a coup attempt shortly after the 2015 vote while traveling in Tanzania and has left Burundi only once since then. Meanwhile international donors have cut support, leaving the government struggling. It has ordered citizens to pay for the upcoming vote.

Many Burundians were surprised when the president announced in 2018 that he was serving his last term. Skepticism persists. The government has approved legislation that bestows upon Nkurunziza the title of “paramount leader” after he steps down.

“It’s hard to know what’s going to happen ... Nkurunziza has a track record of being quite unpredictable,"" said researcher Lane Hartill of the Burundi Human Rights Initiative. ""Both the ruling party and the main opposition party, the CNL, are convinced their candidates are going to win the presidential election. It’s telling, though, that government officials continue to arrest large numbers of CNL members.”

Even some senior members of the ruling party are tired of rights violations and the cratering economy but are afraid to speak out for fear of losing their jobs or being killed, Hartill said.

Burundi's government has denied allegations it targets its people, calling them malicious propaganda by dissidents.

Memories of the 2015 violence are still raw. Jean Baptiste Bakunzi said he remains traumatized by his brother's death at the hands of the police and the Imbonerakure, a militarized youth group associated with the ruling party. His brother, accused of participating in anti-government activities, “knelt down and begged them to save his life,"" Bakunzi said.

""Instead, one policeman pulled the trigger and shot him dead,” he said. “Whoever opposes the ruling party becomes an enemy even today.”

The violence has dimmed hopes for those outside Burundi who will not be able to vote. Over 330,000 refugees are sheltering in Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Congo, according to U.N. figures.

“These elections will not bring hope for us because we have lost so much,"" said Solange Teta, a refugee in Rwanda. “The ruling party candidate cannot alleviate our suffering.""

Sporadic violence persists. Police said two people were killed and eight wounded in a grenade attack Sunday on a bar in Bujumbura that's a popular hangout for ruling party supporters. Opposition supporters worry the security services may retaliate.

Charles Nditije, a former government minister who lives in exile, described the election as a “joke,” calling the polls a formality aimed at installing Nkurunziza's chosen successor.

“What Burundians want now is anything that can bring to (an) end the reign of CNDD-FDD. But the ruling (party) candidate will fight tooth and nail to win fraudulently and set another round of crisis,” he said.

Hartill, the Burundi researcher, said disputed election results could put the country back on edge. The big question, he said, is whether the opposition leader will “say enough is enough.”

As the novel coronavirus continues to impact most aspects of American life, including health care, abortion funds across the country are reporting that calls for assistance have increased.

Abortion funds provide money and other forms of assistance to patients seeking abortions, including to help cover the cost of the procedure itself as well as associated costs like transportation, child care and hotel stays as getting an abortion for many U.S. patients involves traveling long distances to clinics and multi-day processes due to state laws.

The Tampa Bay Abortion Fund reported a 30% increase in callers in April from March, and the Chicago Abortion Fund reported a 35% increase in callers in March and April from February, marking a total year-over-year increase of more than 140%. The Chicago fund notes the yearly increase started before the pandemic, in part due to an increase in restrictive laws around Illinois, but recently it has been seeing an increase in callers who needed the full price of the procedure funded, rather than just a percentage.

Fund Texas Choice and Women Have Options in Ohio report they have had to increase their spending and funding since the pandemic hit in March. Other funds, like the New Orleans Abortion Fund, have become more proactive, increasing outreach and ads so patients can access care.

These increases in need come as the country is facing historic unemployment levels, meaning that people are less able to pay for unexpected costs like those associated with accessing an abortion. And while anti-abortion legislators have been working to shut down access for years, the pandemic has sparked new fights as some state lawmakers seek to label abortion a nonessential procedure.

""All of this, plus the worst unemployment rate since the Great Depression, means people who might not have had the need to call an abortion fund a month ago are now facing economic instability and uncertainty, new difficulties affecting their parenting options and a landscape more hostile to their reproductive choices. As a result, the need for abortion funds only grows,"" Yamani Hernandez, executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, which serves as the umbrella organization for the local funds, told ABC News.

Hernandez noted that the pandemic hit in the midst of the national network's annual fundraising push, which was expected to raise $2 million, so funds are facing even more of a crunch. Even so, she said, ""Abortion funds know what it means to fill the gaps of a public health crisis, and that’s what we’ll continue to do now.""

In Kentucky, one of several states with only one abortion clinic, the state attorney general called for abortion providers to stop providing care in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic in March. Gov. Andy Beshear, a Democrat, vetoed a bill pushed by Republican lawmakers in late April that would have given Attorney General Daniel Cameron the authority to ban abortion procedures during the outbreak.

""Kentucky's anti-abortion laws created the foundation for even more restricted access during the pandemic,"" Meg Sasse Stern, support fund director for Kentucky Health Justice Network, told ABC News.

Kentucky Health Justice Network also reported an increase in calls since March, adding that many callers said they are delaying accessing abortion care because of worries about, and practical barriers created by, coronavirus.

""Transportation and child care remain the largest hurdles that Kentucky patients face, and having to overcome those hurdles has caused patients to delay care,"" Stern said.

Typically, Kentucky Health Justice Network can help patients by driving them to appointments, but Stern said because of coronavirus ""drivers can no longer drive to rural areas to pick up patients for appointments, creating more challenges for the caller.""

Stern also expects the increase in calls for need to continue into the summer with the shelter-in-place orders, ""just as we see after a winter storm event.""

""Even during a pandemic, people will still need abortions, and regardless of when or why folks need support accessing abortions, we are here to accompany them,"" Stern said.",High,Left-center,USA,1

What gyms will look like amid COVID-19 An expert shares five tips to stay as safe as possible back at the gym.

Gyms are known for being social places where people share equipment, are often in close quarters with strangers and sweat together.

All of that is changing as gyms start to reopen in parts of the U.S. amid the coronavirus pandemic.

In Oklahoma -- where gyms were allowed to reopen on May 1 with social distancing and sanitation protocols in place -- some gym members are wearing gloves and masks as they exercise, according to Julie Hibbard, who owns an Anytime Fitness franchise in Ardmore, Oklahoma.

""I added restrictions like a strong suggestion to wear masks, mandatory wiping down of equipment and we only have 25% capacity [of members inside the gym],"" said Hibbard, adding that she watches the gym's security cameras to make sure protocols are followed. ""I also added social distancing, so [members and staff] have to keep 15 feet away from people inside the gym.""

Hibbard, who also owns three gyms in Texas, said she also has a professional cleaning staff that cleans the gym every day and a staff member who cleans the gym hourly, a sign of the additional precautions most gyms will be expected to take.

In Texas, where gyms will be allowed to open on May 18, Kaitlyn Gannon, the owner of Dallas Iron Fitness, is busy making adjustments to her two private, boutique gym locations so that they can reopen.

""All of our members, upon entering, will have to wash their hands. We'll have spray bottles around the gym and members are required to spray down equipment after the first touch,"" she told ""GMA."" ""Every member has to wash their hands when they’re done and we have antibacterial hand sanitizer at the front and they have to put that on as they leave.""

The gym's personal trainers will rely on verbal cues in order to maintain a safe distance from clients and will wear masks as needed and members will have to book appointments to work out, according to Gannon. The gym will start a modified class schedule one week after it opens, with only two to five people per class instead of the usual 15.

""The environment is just going to be totally different and the support we need is immeasurable,"" said Gannon, whose second gym location opened the day before stay-at-home orders were put in place in Texas. ""Know that gym owners and staff are doing everything possible to open up in a clean environment.""

Nationally, gyms and boutique studios -- even ones that have not yet announced plans to reopen -- are already giving their members a glimpse of what the future will look like.

Equinox, a national gym chain, has told members they will need to book visits via the gym's app and will have their temperatures checked upon entry using touchless thermometers. Members will also be required to wear masks except while ""vigorously training"" and have to follow guidelines to accommodate for social distancing.

Extra luxuries like saunas, pools, showers, kids' clubs and basketball courts will also be closed during the initial reopening of gyms, according to Equinox.

Soul Cycle, a national chain of cycling studios owned by Equinox, is planning to limit the number of riders in each class to allow for social distancing and is encouraging riders to wait outside or in their cars before class. They will also check the temperatures of their staff members and also riders if required by state or local governments, according to the chain's website.

And Gold's Gym, which already has opened around five company-owned gyms and over 20 franchise gyms across the U.S., has spaced out its cardio and strength equipment to meet social distancing standards. Company-owned gyms are requiring staff to wear face masks and gloves and recommending that members wear masks as well, in addition to instituting additional cleaning protocols such as a cleaning intermission between 1 and 2 p.m. local time.

The gyms that have already reopened are reporting a record number of people signing up for new memberships, according to Gold’s Gym President and CEO Adam Zeitsiff.

""They'd never been a member before. They just wanted to be active, wanted to be healthy,"" Zeitsiff told ABC News of the new members. ""They probably were sick of being at home and decided this was time for me to make that emotional decision.""

How to know if it's safe to return to the gym

The reopening of gyms across the U.S. is happening at the same time that the number of coronavirus cases and deaths continues to rise in this country, reaching more than 1.3 million diagnosed cases and at least 82,548 deaths.

People who live in areas where COVID-19 still has a major presence and are viewed as vulnerable -- those age 65 and older and people with pre-existing conditions like heart disease and diabetes -- should exercise caution still when it comes to returning to a gym or boutique fitness studio, according to Dr. Simone Wildes, a Boston-based infectious disease specialist.

""If you live in an area with large numbers of COVID-19 cases, it places you at higher risk for contracting the disease, so it might not be wise to return to the gym at this time,"" she told ""GMA."" ""And the vulnerable population might have to wait until vaccines and effective treatments are available. They should sign up for virtual classes or continue to exercise outdoors.""

""However, if you live in an area of low incidence of the virus, and your gym has taken all the necessary steps, then I would return. However, if not reassured by the measures at the gym, I would continue my workout at home and outdoors,"" Wildes added.

The risk of transmission of COVID-19 at the gym comes not from sweat -- there is no evidence that virus is spread through sweat -- but through frequently touched surfaces, like weights, strength machines and treadmills, that you may touch and then touch your face, eyes, nose and mouth, increasing the risk of contracting the virus, according to Wildes.

It is also more difficult to maintain the recommended six feet of physical distance from another person inside a gym than it would be outdoors or inside your own home. The main way the virus is spread is through respiratory droplets via coughing and sneezing, but also when breathing hard and forcefully exhaling, as commonly occurs during exercise, experts say.

If you are ready to head back to the gym, here are Wildes' five recommendations to stay as safe as possible.

1. Practice safe social distancing: Maintain a distance of at least six feet from other people in the gym, recommends Wildes.

2. Clean equipment before and after use: ""Definitely clean the equipment before and after use and use and use hand sanitizer between equipment use.""

3. Wear gloves: ""I would wear workout gloves as well for extra layer of protection from touching high touch surface areas.""

4. Wear a cloth face covering: ""The CDC has recommended that a cloth face covering be worn in public settings where other social distancing measures will be difficult to be enforced especially in areas of significant community-based transmission. Wear cloth face coverings that you can breathe through comfortably and your nose and mouth are fully covered. The mask should fit snugly against the sides of your face so there are no gaps.""

""The face covering should be either tied or secured to prevent slipping while working out. Wash mask after use. Try not to touch your eyes, mouth or nose when removing mask from face and wash or sanitize your hands immediately after removal.""

5. Make sure your gym is taking all necessary precautions: Wildes recommends reading your gym's COVID-19 guidelines to make sure the below questions are answered, and asking the gym directly if they are not.

- How will the club limit the individuals in the facility while maintaining social distancing requirements and how will this be managed?

- Will there be signs and floor markers in place to help members?

- Will there be temperature checks or just symptom checks to enter the building?

- What are your cleaning protocols? Will equipment be cleaned before and after use with EPA-approved disinfectants. Any additional cleaning with UV lighting?

- How will staff be protected -- i.e. the cleaning staff, personal trainers and front desk staff -- from coronavirus and will they be given personal protective equipment?

- Do you have a return to work policy in place for employees that are COVID-19 positive?

- Will there be continual training and updates of staff on COVID-19?

- Will there be group exercise or small groups happening?

- How will social distancing on free weights and cardio machines be enforced?

- Will all the members be required to wear a face mask during workouts and do you have masks on hand for those without masks?

- Are childcare services available and what protocols are in place for adequate sanitation?

- Will there be fans and will doors and windows be opened to keep air moving?

- What is the communication protocol for informing members of the gym if others members are diagnosed with COVID-19?

It was a show like no other for country music star Keith Urban.

Instead of people standing together in a massive auditorium or on a field like at past shows, the audience members for this surprise performance, all health care workers, watched the ""We Were"" singer from their cars, parked 6 feet apart.

""It felt amazing to be playing,"" Urban said. ""People were honking horns and flicking headlights. ... It was really magical.""

The surprise concert Urban performed on Thursday was held at the Stardust Drive-In Movie Theater, about 40 miles east of Nashville, Tennessee. He was one of the first artists in the country to perform a live show in front of an audience since the onset of the pandemic.

Almost 125 vehicles filled the parking lot for the unannounced show, which was only for doctors, nurses, EMTs and staff from Vanderbilt Health, a division of Vanderbilt University Medical Center.

""So we had the idea for the drive-in ... over a month ago,"" Urban said. ""It's an obvious venue because you're playing to people in cars, which is such a great way to keep the distance between everybody in a safe environment, but the venue is already built.""

""We just set about figuring it out, how to do it in a safe way,"" he continued. ""The crew could be minimized. Musicians on stage could be minimal, everything just had to be very, very minimal.""

Urban and his crew's decision to hold a concert using this format was a huge first step as the world of live music tries to find its footing amid the ongoing pandemic.

""Just freezing and stopping and doing nothing is just not an option,"" Urban said. ""So, how do we move forward, steadily, methodically, not just for us but for the audience too? The audience is out there and they want to come and see something but they want to feel like it's a safe environment and everything's been thought through.""

Concerts and festivals haven't been immune to the nationwide stay-at-home orders. The music industry is preparing to lose an estimated $9 billion in ticket sales, according to a study published by the trade publication Pollster.

Some of today's biggest entertainers are finding new ways to adapt and connect with fans.

Doja Cat's song ""Say So"" became a No. 1 hit, fueled by a TikTok dance craze. Artists like Ariana Grande, Justin Beiber and Drake have filmed quarantine-themed videos. Legendary DJs have turned their living rooms into night clubs and live streamed dance sets.

""One amazing thing that we've seen is that artists are feeling they're still entertainers and they still want to bring people together,"" said Puja Patel, editor-in-chief of Pitchfork. ""We've seen everyone from Cardi B to Diplo ... take over their Instagram Lives. ... Travis Scott did a concert within Fortnite.""

""It's been really special to see so many musicians come together for their fans and to know that fans really need them right now and they need kind of that escape,"" she added.

Patel said livestreaming is crucial right now for artists while everyone is stuck at home.

""So many people are turning to mobile devices for entertainment,"" she said. ""I think this will get us through, but believe live music will return in a public facing way. For now, I think these shows are the way we move forward.""

Derrick Jones, whose stage name is ""D-Nice,"" has been called a hero for his livestream sets dubbed ""Club Quarantine,"" streaming for hours on end and breaking the internet with as many as 100,000 viewers. Guests for that show included Michelle Obama, the Kardashians and Mark Zuckerberg.

""I started DJ-ing and, listen, the energy was just different, it really felt like a party,"" Jones said. ""Then I would read the comments and then say, 'Wow, I was putting out energy,' but based on what people were saying, I could really feel the energy.""

""That's when I realized this thing has legs,"" he continued. ""This is a good thing that's happening and it just keeps going.""

But for someone who built his career on the road performing for big audiences, he says it's not the same.

""Before the pandemic, I was on the plane every few days. My gigs were all over,"" Jones said. ""Once the pandemic hit, I had to be still and sit at home. I honestly didn't know what to do because I almost didn't recognize this was my residence because I was never here.""

It's a sentiment shared by people in jobs all over the industry. Longtime production manager Chris Gratton said there are many others in the business who are being forgotten in the pandemic.

""It's really affected the 12 million people in the entertainment business, you know, live entertainment in the U.S. alone,"" Gratton said. ""I mean, we have caterers, there's the popcorn poppers, the ushers, the parking lot people. It's not just the roadies.""

Gratton said it's these unsung heroes who have been hit the hardest.

""We go to the studio, do work with the artists and the dancers and the choreographers and designers and work throughout the day ... going through setlists, getting everything advanced,"" he said.

He said his team was supposed to kick off Justin Bieber's ""Changes"" tour on Friday in Seattle.

""This would have been the day we would have finished production rehearsal,"" he said. ""It's kind of sad for me and the fellas that we're not doing that today, but our time will come. So we will be back.""

A roadie for over 30 years, working for artists like Ariana Grande, Kanye West and J Balvin, Gratton said he's never seen anything like this.

""Man, the only thing that even comes close at all would be 9/11,"" he said. ""Everybody was afraid to fly. So everybody postponed or canceled for a few weeks. But that was a few weeks, the maximum a month. And then everybody got back up to it. And, you know, it was scary, but it's the only thing we ever got close to this.""

Gratton spends around 10 months a year on the road. Now he and 87 employees on his team are out of work. He said he's worried about his crew and their families being able to put food on their tables.

""We're going to get to that point. Independent contractors often live check to check,"" he said. ""We went from having the biggest year ... to zero dollars overnight.""

Gratton said he's eager to get back to work, but believes his team is looking at up to two years before things get back to normal.

""It's not just a matter of doing a show,"" he said. ""How do you park the kids outside? How do you line up? How do I dump my trucks with the band gear into it, into the building when you have a lot of heavy gear? You need to try to stay 6 feet apart. You're wearing masks.""

""I want to hear the drums,"" Gratton continued. ""You know, I want to feel the music. We want to open Justin Bieber's doors and the girls go crazy when 'Baby' comes on ... you can't get that off a computer. There's nothing better than live music, and it's truly the only language we all speak. We need to bring it back, of course, and it shall come back.""

It's a major setback for the industry like it has never experienced before. Patel said she believes this moment in time will be forever remembered as one of the ""great musical moments of the past.""

""The music that comes out during this period will be remembered forever as coronavirus music,"" she said.

For Urban, while he said it felt ""extraordinary"" to be back on stage, he still misses being able to do ""meet and greets"" and shake hands with his fans.

""There's a huge amount of it that I miss,"" he said. ""I miss the physical connectivity with an audience. I don't know when we're going to get to play or mosh pit again. A bunch of car headlights is not the same as a mosh pit, I can tell you that much.

""I derive so much of my energy on stage from that audience right down there and everybody is in this flow. I miss that.""",High,Left-center,USA,1

In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, with new social distancing requirements and ever-changing, state-by-state safety restrictions, many owners of bars and clubs are waiting with bated breath.

The coveted counter space and tables at Dante -- a famously packed, award-winning cocktail bar and restaurant in New York City -- quickly shifted to slinging specialty drinks via curbside pickup and delivery until restrictions are eased. But the staffers are taking service amid the pandemic ""one day at a time"" until they construct a plan to fully reopen.

""To be honest, none of us have any idea as to when things will really start to change,"" Linden Pride, owner of the Greenwich Village staple, told ABC News. ""This whole process has pushed us to create a full takeout and delivery menu, as well as cocktails to-go, which has taken us out of our comfort zone to create new, alternative experiences for our guests.""

Pride said he wants to continue the new experiences ""once this is all over."" He and his wife, Natalie, got the idea from a pop-up cocktail event in New Orleans, where people ""drink in a plastic cup and walk down the street."" They found thousands of stickers left over that read, ""'One for the road,' or 'a roadie' as we call it in Australia,"" Pride added.

He hailed New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for quickly recognizing current liquor-licensing regulations that needed to be amended.

""As soon as the changes were brought into effect, which allowed cocktails to be purchased both for pick-up and delivery, with food, we saw this as an opportunity to try and keep the business operational, which would allow us to retain staff whilst continuing to provide a service to the community,"" Pride told ABC News.

Pride said, ""it's so hard to know"" definitively what service operations at Dante might look like in the future, but that he and his staff are keeping a close eye on operations in other states, including Georgia and Colorado.

""When we're allowed to open, we will adhere to CDC, WHO and state guidelines,"" Pride said, adding that he's already stocked up on thermometers to check people's temperatures at the door and that he's looking into creating disposable menus and setting up sanitizing stations, in addition to enforcing social distancing.

""One cool initiative"" he's seen at bars and restaurants in parts of Europe, ""is the extension of outdoor dining -- with some street closures."" Pride said he sees a ""real opportunity in New York"" for designated outdoor dining and drinking areas to enable places on low-traffic streets to set up ""socially distanced tables"" and serve people responsibly.

Mayor Bill de Blasio said Thursday that the possibility of restaurants and bars opening in the city's streets is ""being very thoroughly discussed"" and ""something we might be able to reach.""

""I've been talking to restaurant owners ... they're making a great case that this could be a difference-maker,"" de Blasio said. ""You have the right social distancing and protections, the right capacity ... and the right atmosphere. We have to be smart about it."" This could only come after New York City meets the city's indicators for 10 to 14 days and meets the state's indicators, which de Blasio said could be possible in the first half of June.

Pride said that with ""any kind of reopening, it doesn't mean that customers are going to flock to [bars] and fill up those seats."" Dante will look for other inventive options to recreate what Pride calls the ""ritual and experience"" of going out, like ""creating a Friday night takeaway kit"" complete with cocktails and a playlist to give customers the full experience at home.

Pride has also been in contact with close friends in the industry, including the operator of New York's PDT, and said bars and lounges that rely solely on beverages and bottle service will face ""a huge challenge because they don't have full-service kitchens.""

A standard liquor license requires nightclubs and bars to serve food in order to run a full-service beer, wine and liquor operation, according to the New York State Liquor Authority.

Eddie Dean, owner of the Brooklyn club Schimanski, has been through many ups and downs after 30 years in the nightlife business, but he's worried now about bars and clubs.

""These businesses are built on volume. A very large percentage of small bars and restaurants pretty much go week to week hoping to make payroll,"" he told ABC News. ""I imagine a high percentage of New York City-based hospitality businesses will not reopen -- or open but not be able to sustain. It's going to be ugly.""

Schimanski ""acted fast to close down"" -- perishable items cleaned out, sound equipment covered, employees furloughed. Dean now is having ""preliminary conversations"" with the landlord to ""get through this mess as best as possible.""

""So far,"" he added, ""I have not heard anything positive for clubs. Any notion of opening at 25 or 50% capacity or even 75% isn't realistic. We will do what it takes to ensure the safety of our staff and all our guests.""

Even amid the current difficulties, Dean said there have been silver linings, like staying in touch with his team and ""thinking of new ideas and concepts."" And being able to rest a bit ""has been welcome.""

""Anyone who knows me knows I love a good challenge. This is certainly a big challenge. I can't wait to get back and do great things,"" he added.

Slate, a multi-floor lounge and nightclub with multiple bars and hundreds of hands-on games like pool and ping pong, has catered to Manhattan's lively late-night crowds for over 20 years. But it could struggle welcoming back customers at a 6-foot distance.

Owner Aristotle ""Telly"" Hatzigeorgiou told ABC News, ""We're adjusting as best we can.""

The owner's plan for a return to operations will eventually include ""strict sanitation guidelines that will be followed between each use, and we'll make sure all tables, chairs and games are spread apart enough that people can safely socially distance themselves.""

He added: ""Temperatures will be taken at the door. Hand sanitation stations will be placed all over the venue, and markers will be placed both inside and on the sidewalk outside for any line that may form to ensure guests stay 6 feet apart while we check IDs, take temperatures and check coats.""

Hatzigeorgiou plans to take full advantage of the sprawling 17,000-square foot, two-floor space. ""Once restaurants are given the OK to open in NYC,"" he said, ""we can start to open some parts of Slate.""

For bars with live music, like Howl at the Moon in San Antonio, COVID-19 could silence the big, bustling crowds that scribble down song requests and pass the papers up through the bar to the stage.

Denise Ramirez, a musician who plays piano at the hopping venue on the San Antonio Riverwalk, told ABC News that after three years there she has a different perspective for what a new normal could mean.

""Howl is typically a packed house, especially on weekends when we get a lot of bachelorette parties and birthday parties booking up tables,"" she said.

The music-centric bar has 14 different locations in the U.S. and has to keep track of ""all the different regulations being put in place by different state and local governments,"" Ramirez explained. ""I can only assume that's only made it more difficult for them as a company to figure out what they're going to do.""

""Their plan is to wait until bars can open at a full capacity or near-full capacity, because in their words, 'Howl has to be Howl,' which makes sense to me,"" the pianist said. ""I've been part of a now-closed Howl establishment in New York City and have seen what happens if it tries to remain open for only five people on a Tuesday. And I think it's the right move.""

Ramirez and the other entertainers, bartenders, servers and door attendants were furloughed, and she thinks they will ""wait quite a bit before reopening,"" even with the state of Texas currently reopening restaurants at 25% capacity. ""The return to nightlife is going to be a mixed bag. I would expect lots of excitement from everyone having cabin fever, but I'd also expect quite a few rules in place.""

""I don't think anyone wants to be singing on stage with masks on,"" Ramirez said about a discussion with her fellow musician friends. ""We turn to nightlife to escape from our problems, so having a reminder of the pandemic onstage in front of us would kind of defeat that purpose.""

The Broadway lights are permanently going dark for the popular Disney musical ""Frozen,"" based on the 2013 Oscar-winning animated film.

The heartbreaking news was made Thursday as Thomas Schumacher, president and producer of Disney Theatrical Productions, confirmed the beloved musical will not return when Broadway reopens.

Citing the ""industry-wide shutdown and resulting economic fallout"" of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic as the cause of the shuttering, Schumacher announced in a statement that ""'Frozen,' like all shows, is wholly dependent on those who create and perform them but this was an uncommonly close and talented group and they’ll be missed.""

The Broadway staple opened March 22, 2018, and ran for 825 performances. When the curtains fell on March 11, 2020, nobody knew that performance was going to be the musical's final bow on Broadway.

Not only does this signify Broadway's first permanent closure due to the novel coronavirus, the news sets an uncertain future for many musicals considering how successful ""Frozen"" was.

Over 1.3 million people turned up to watch Anna, Elsa, Olaf and Kristoff on the stage; the musical grossed over $150 million during its nearly two-year run. It was also nominated for the Best Musical Tony Award.

""I have to acknowledge our incredible audiences; night after night, the fans showed us how much they loved this show and we look forward to seeing them at 'Frozen' around the world,"" Schumacher concluded.

Tickets for the Broadway musical purchased via Ticketmaster will be refunded. Those who used other channels to secure tickets should contact their vendor.

While its run on Broadway has come to an end, a future North American tour for ""Frozen"" is in the works. In addition, starting next year, the Disney musical will open in Australia, Japan, Germany and the United Kingdom.

The announcement on Friday came one day after ousted vaccine chief Rick Bright said there are no plans to distribute a vaccine on an equitable scale, and called the timeline of 12 to 18 months being presented ""an aggressive schedule.""

""A lot of optimism is swirling around a 12-to-18-month time frame if everything goes perfectly. We've never seen everything go perfectly,"" Bright said Thursday before House lawmakers. ""I think it's going to take longer than that to do so.""

Trump departs the White House for Camp David

Before he boarded Marine One bound for Camp David late this afternoon, President Trump briefly spoke to reporters and was asked whether the COVID-19 vaccine should be available for free.

""We're looking at that, actually. But we're making a lot of progress on vaccines,"" Trump said. ""But we'll be speaking to you very soon, and I think we're going to have a very good couple of meetings at Camp David.""

He said he would have ""some military"" discussions and ""some other than military"" talks over the weekend.

When the president visited Camp David for another getaway weekend two weeks ago, it was the first time he had left the White House since March 28. Since then, he's also visited the battleground states of Arizona and Pennsylvania.

Trump says truckers blaring horns outside White House during event honoring people connected to COVID-19 'are on our side'

As they did earlier, truckers protesting near the White House blared their horns during a second event in the Rose Garden this afternoon meant to honor people connected to COVID-19.

""Those are friendly truckers, they are on our side,"" Trump told the audience. ""It is almost a celebration, in a way.""

The horns were very loud and could be heard at all times while Trump and the honorees spoke.

The truckers have protested in Washington for nearly two weeks over fair pay and low freight rates during the pandemic -- not in favor of, or against, the president.

The afternoon event's honorees included a nurse from West Virginia who volunteered in New York, a property owner from Arkansas who waived rent for his tenants and a Girl Scout troop from Maryland that donated cookies to first responders.

One of the scouts kept her mask on when she took the podium to speak. Three in the troop stepped forward to accept certificates from an unmasked President Trump.

The White House said the event, similar to one held two weeks ago, was meant to highlight the ""hard work, heroism and hope that Americans from all walks of life have exemplified during the COVID-19 pandemic.""

New White House coronavirus task force members announced

Vice President Mike Pence's office announced the addition of five people to the White House coronavirus task force on Friday, as the group shifts its messaging to focus on safely reopening the country, even though the country's infection rate has yet to significantly drop.

The new members include: Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue, Secretary of Labor Gene Scalia, Director of the National Institutes of Health Dr. Francis Collins, FDA Director of the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research Dr. Peter Marks and Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration Thomas Engels.

In a written statement, Pence said these new members ""will add expertise in the fields of vaccines and therapeutics as well as worker safety as the Task Force renews its focus on getting Americans back to work.""

The president and vice president are currently maintaining distance from each other after two White House staffers tested posted for coronavirus last week. Trump said Thursday of Pence: ""I miss him.""

Trump names leaders of 'Operation Warp Speed,' says vaccine could come before the end of the year

President Donald Trump delivered remarks on vaccine development Friday afternoon, proclaiming that ""Operation Warp Speed,"" his administration's initiative to fast-track a vaccine, is the country's biggest undertaking since the Manhattan Project.

""Nobody has seen anything like we are doing now within our country since the Second World War. It's objective is to finish developing and then to manufacture and distribute a proven coronavirus vaccine as fast as possible. Again, we'd love to see if we can do it prior to the end of the year,"" Trump said, adding that the military is ""totally involved.""

Touting his message of reopening, the ever-optimistic president also said ""vaccine or no vaccine"" the country is already coming back.

""I just want to make something clear. It's very important. Vaccine or no vaccine, we're back, and we're starting the process. And in many cases, they don't have vaccines, and a virus or a flu comes, and you fight through it,"" Trump said.

""As of this morning, almost every state has taken steps to begin reopening, and the American people are doing an extraordinary job of continuing to take precautions while at the same time wanting to start, and they will be starting to resume their American way of life,"" he added.

Trump said in the afternoon remarks from the Rose Garden that the development of treatments, in addition to vaccines, will be fast-tracked and made available ""quickly,"" and ""maybe before"" the end of the year.

He also formally announced that former pharmaceutical executive Moncef Slaoui will lead the country's vaccine development with Army Gen. Gustave Perna, the commander of United States Army Materiel Command, working alongside him.

Trump said vaccines will be made ""right here in the U.S.A."" but that he will help other countries in every way possible.

""We have no ego when it comes to this, no ego whatsoever,"" the president said.

His call to also ""ramp up production of supplies needed for distribution, such as cold chain storage, glass vials, needles, syringes, and more,"" came one day after ousted vaccine chief Rick Bright told lawmakers the federal government has faced depletions of N95 masks, swabs and other essential equipment since January.

Since Bright said his concerns were ignored by officials including Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Azar has stayed by the president's side, and even joined him Thursday to criticize his former employee.

""Our vision for Operation Warp Speed -- setting a goal of a vaccine by January 2021 -- will be one of the great scientific and humanitarian accomplishments in human history,"" Azar said Friday, standing next to the president.

""Dr. Slaoui is arguably the world's most experienced and successful vaccine developer, responsible for some of the major recent breakthroughs in vaccines. General Perna oversees one of the world's largest logistics and supply chain operations, the one that keeps the army running,"" he continued.

Trump was later asked to follow up on what he meant when he said the country is back, ""vaccine on no vaccine.""

""We think we're going to have a vaccine in the pretty near future, and if we do, we're gonna really be a big step ahead. And if we don't, we're gonna be like so many other cases where you had a problem come in, it'll go away at some point,"" Trump said. ""But if it does flare up, we're gonna put out the fire and will put it out quickly and efficiently.""

In an interview with Fox Business aired Thursday, President Trump said he plans to mobilize the U.S. military to distribute the vaccine when it becomes available, focusing first on older Americans who are among the most at risk.

""I just literally left a meeting. We're are mobilizing our military -- and other forces, but we are mobilizing our military on the basis that we do have a vaccine,"" he said. ""Our military is now being mobilized so at the end of the year, we're going to be able to give it to a lot of people very, very rapidly.""

FDA commissioner says it's up to White House if they'll still use Abbott ID NOW test after accuracy concerns

Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Steven Hahn said on ""CBS"" Friday morning ""that will be a White House decision"" as to whether they still use the Abbott ID NOW test in light of an FDA notice ""alerting the public to early data that suggest potential inaccurate results.""

""Specifically, the test may return false negative results,"" the agency said in a statement Thursday night.

When asked if he'd continue to recommend the White House use it, Hahn said he would provide guidance.

""We're providing guidance to the White house regarding this test,"" Hahn said from his self-quarantine, which he's undergoing after he came into contact with a person who tested positive. ""We have been on an ongoing basis. And we will continue to do that. That will be a White House decision.""

Hahn noted that the FDA continues ""to recommend its use or to have it available for use"" and that, in light of the notice his agency sent, ""it might be worth, if the test is negative, getting a second confirmatory test. That's what our guidance is about.""

He also said the FDA is continuing to investigate the issue but that others haven't reported the same problems.

""There are some data to suggest that there may be inaccuracies, false negatives, with the Abbott test,"" he said. ""However, there are many users who have contacted us and have not had this problem.""

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced additions to a task force being sent to Amarillo, Texas, where the governor announced 700 people have tested positive for COVID-19.

The cases appear to be tied to several meat-packing plants in the region.

Abbott announced that several plants have been shut down.

Members of the Texas Emergency Medical Task Force and Texas National Guard were sent to the area on May 5 to gather information on the booming number of cases with the results announced Saturday.

""As Texas continues ramping up its testing capabilities, there will be an increase in positive cases as the state targets the most high-risk areas: nursing homes, meat packing plants and jails,"" Abbott said in a statement. ""That is exactly why I established Surge Response Teams. By immediately deploying resources and supplies to these high risk areas, we will identify the positive cases, isolate the individuals and ensure any outbreak is quickly contained, which is the strategy being deployed in Amarillo.""

Members of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Texas Division of Emergency Management, Texas Department of State Health Services and BCFS Health and Human Services are now also responding to the area, the governor announced.

2:12 p.m.: Chartered boat services can resume in New Jersey

Fishing and watercraft rentals are set to resume in New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy announced.

The announcement comes a day after Murphy said Jersey Shore beaches would reopen.

Chartered boat services are permitted to reopen at 6 a.m. Sunday, with mandatory social distancing and sanitizing measures in place. Murphy also said that people will pay either online or over the phone to reduce in-person interactions.

Murphy said the metrics of COVID-19, including patients in hospitals, patients on ventilators and patients in the ICU, all were down in a way that showed ""we can move forward.""

The governor added that the declines were not just from peaks but ""meaningful,"" even over the past couple of weeks.

A red zone has been established in a rural town near Naples, Italy, to stop a small outbreak.

Residents in Letino have been ordered to quarantine until May 20, according to a decree from the regional government of Campania.

The small town of about 600 has seen 10 positive COVID-19 cases in the last 24 hours, in addition to three reported earlier this week, according to the local newspaper Il Mattino. All patients were asymptomatic.

The decree states that residents cannot leave the municipal area, and all non-essential activities, including commercial and restaurant activity, will be prohibited.

The temporary quarantine comes two days before the country's next phase of lifting restrictions begins. Non-essential businesses, such as restaurants and hairdressers, will be allowed to reopen.

The Watkins Glen International automobile racetrack, in Schuyler County in the western part of the state, also will be allowed to reopen, Cuomo said. The governor did not provide details on what events would be held there, but like the horse racing tracks, fans will not be permitted yet.

Cuomo said he's looking to increase economic activity, including events that can operate without crowds.

Elective surgeries and ambulatory care also will be allowed to resume in Westchester County and Suffolk County. The hospitalization rate, intubations and number of new cases all continue to decline, even with 400 new hospitalizations in the state, Cuomo said.

An additional 157 people died in the last 24 hours.

11:47 a.m.: FDA authorizes 1st standalone at-home sample collection kit

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has authorized the first at-home sample collection kit for COVID-19, which can be used to send samples to specified laboratories for diagnostic testing.

The Everlywell COVID-19 Test Home Collection Kit allows a person to self-collect a nasal sample at home. It can be used by people who have been screened using on online questionnaire that is reviewed by a health care provider, the FDA said.

Additionally, the FDA authorized two COVID-19 diagnostic tests that can be used with the at-home collected samples.

Jeffrey Shuren, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said the development provides ""increased patient access to tests"" and ""protects others from potential exposure.""

""Today's action is also another great example of public-private partnerships in which data from a privately funded study was used by industry to support an EUA request, saving precious time as we continue our fight against this pandemic,"" Shuren said in a statement.

9:40 a.m.: CDC updates guidance for pediatricians

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has updated its guidance on treating children during the pandemic to include information on a new illness associated with COVID-19.

The agency said it was working with domestic and international partners to better understand multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, aka MIS-C, including how common it is and its risk factors.

There are 220 possible and confirmed cases in 20 states and Washington, D.C., of the illness in children, according to an ABC News analysis. There have also been three reported deaths.

Some of the cases have tested positive for either COVID-19 or antibodies, while some others have tested negative. Many of the cases are still under investigation.

Children with MIS-C have presented to hospitals with a persistent fever and a variety of symptoms, including multi-organ (e.g., cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, hematologic, dermatologic, neurologic) involvement and elevated inflammatory markers, according to the CDC.

However, the CDC warned pediatricians that some children may exhibit symptoms not listed

It is possible that a child will begin exhibiting symptoms of MIS-C weeks after they were infected with COVID-19, according to the CDC. However, a child may not have displayed symptoms for COVID-19 and both the child and parents may not have even known they were infected.

The CDC said that evaluating a child for MIS-C could include a chest X-ray, echocardiography or blood testing to determine if there is inflammation.

For questions on the illness, the CDC's 24-hour Emergency Operations Center at 770-488-7100 is open.

6:55 a.m.: Charges dropped against Tampa pastor

The charges against a Tampa pastor who was arrested after holding services despite the local stay-at-home orders have been dropped.

State officials said they dropped the charges against pastor Rodney Howard-Browne because he has complied with social distancing rules on his church campus since his arrest.

""In deciding whether to criminally prosecute violations of stay-at-home orders, compliance is our North Star,"" Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren said in a statement Friday. ""Each case is unique, and each one will be assessed based on the facts and the law. But, in general, if the person who was arrested poses no ongoing threat to public health, then our tendency will be not to prosecute the case beyond the arrest.""

Howard-Browne initially was arrested and charged with unlawful assembly and violation of a public health emergency order after holding large services at his church in defiance of the county's ""safer-at-home"" initiative.

""The State Attorney's Office has recognized that compliance and not criminal punishment is the focus of our emergency health laws,"" Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a statement Friday night. ""Law enforcement's intervention through arrest has been rare during this health crisis, and while it remains a necessary tool to protect the health and safety of our community, we agree that further criminal sanctions are not necessary in this instance.""

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Friday that Florida would move into a Phase 1 reopening on Monday, which means gyms can reopen and restaurants can now be at 50% capacity. The state's partial reopening began on May 4.

There have been more than 44,000 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 and at least 1,917 deaths in Florida.

4:09 a.m.: New York tourist arrested in Hawaii for violating mandatory quarantine

A 23-year-old tourist from New York City was arrested Friday in Hawaii for violating the state's mandatory 14-day quarantine rule and for ""unsworn falsification to authority.""

Tarique Peters, according to the Hawaii Department of the Attorney General, arrived in Oahu on Monday and quickly posted numerous pictures of himself on the beach on Instagram.

He allegedly left his hotel room the day he arrived and traveled to various places using public transportation, officials said.

Citizens alerted local authorities to Peters' social media postings, which showed him on the beach with a surfboard, sunbathing and walking around Waikiki.

""We appreciate the assistance of local people who spot flagrant violations of our emergency rules on various social media sites and report them to the appropriate authorities,"" Hawaii Attorney General Clare Connors said in a statement Friday night.

Officials said the hotel told them Peters was seen leaving his room and the hotel on numerous occasions this week.

Peters, who's from the Bronx, was arrested Friday, and his bail was set at $4,000.

Hawaii has only 638 diagnosed cases of COVID-19, with at least 17 deaths.

As Amazon faces increased calls for transparency over how many employees have tested positive for COVID-19, the company confirmed to ABC News on Friday that another warehouse worker in New York has died amid the pandemic.

George Leigh, who worked at a facility in Long Island, died of complications from coronavirus on April 9, his niece Jasmine Leigh told ABC News. She added that George's family was in the middle of planning a surprise party for his upcoming 60th birthday at the end of summer.

""He was always loving, caring and bright,"" Jasmine Leigh said of her uncle. ""He was really close to his mom and all his siblings. He would call his mom every day.""

""We just want to get answers from Amazon,"" she added. ""We just want to get his story out there because we don't think that Amazon is doing enough to protect their workers. ... We also want for Amazon to be more aware of their workers. Their workers aren't just a number.""

Amazon did not respond to an ABC News inquiry over how many employees so far have died from COVID-19, but pressure appears to be building on the company as more deaths are reported in the media.

""We are saddened by the loss of an associate who had worked at our site in Bethpage, New York. His family and loved ones are in our thoughts,"" Rachael Lighty, an Amazon spokesperson, told ABC News in a statement.

He was last at work March 28, according to Amazon, which also said it's notified all associates within the building of their colleague's death.

Earlier this week, a coalition of 13 attorneys general led by Maura Healey of Massachusetts sent a letter to Amazon pressing for stronger measures to protect the health and safety of workers amid the pandemic, and requesting information on how many workers have been infected and how many have died.

""We have requested but not received information on how many of the Companies' workers have been infected with COVID-19, and how many have died from it. Please provide a state-by-state breakdown for each Company with this information,"" the letter stated.

The letter added that the attorneys general were ""dismayed to have heard multiple reports of Amazon warehouses with inadequate PPE and hand sanitizer, inability to practice social distancing, limited opportunity to wash hands, and other deficiencies that put employees at risk.""

Healey's office said in a statement that the state attorneys general are ""alarmed by recent media reports"" that allege ""insufficient data about infections and deaths"" among Amazon workers.

In an interview that aired Sunday with CBS, Amazon's head of operations, Dave Clark, didn't answer when asked how many workers had tested positive for COVID-19.

""The actual ... total number of cases isn't particularly useful because it's relative to the size of the building and then the overall community infection rate,"" Clark told CBS.

""We know,"" he added, when pressed for the figure. ""I don't have the number right on me at this moment because it's not a particularly useful number.""

Lighty told ABC News ensuring the health and safety of employees is a ""top concern"" for Amazon, adding that they ""expect to invest approximately $4 billion from April to June on COVID-related initiatives to get products to customers and keep employees safe.""

""We are going to great lengths to keep the buildings extremely clean and help employees practice important precautions such as social distancing and other measures,"" Lighty said in the statement, adding that Amazon directly alerts, via text message, every person at a site anytime there's a confirmed diagnosis, including information on when that individual was last in the building.

Jasmine Leigh said that she and her family would like to see even more information from Amazon when a worker tests positive for COVID-19, noting that George Leigh came in contact with so many people at work every day and that they don't know how he was exposed to the virus.

""He trained a lot of people, so who knows how many people he got in contact with?"" Jasmine Leigh said. ""Them not saying anything is not helping anyone.""

Jasmine Leigh said that she wants her uncle to be remembered by ""how many people loved him.""

""Even with him dying, we've got a lot of people, his coworkers reaching out to us and saying, 'Oh, he was a very funny guy, he would come to work every day with a smile on his face and everybody would be so happy to see him,'"" she said.",High,Left-center,USA,1
