John Robert “Johnny” Boone vouched for his release on the grounds that he is 76, in poor health and has served most of his 57-month prison sentence, The Courier Journal reported Thursday. Elmer George, his lawyer, added Boone has a history of illnesses and called his continued imprisonment life-threatening.

About 137 inmates and eight prison employees have tested positive for the novel coronavirus at the Federal Correctional Institution at Elkton, where Boone is serving out his prison sentence. Another 63 inmates and 44 prison employees have recovered after testing positive for the virus, the Courier Journal reported.

The U.S. Bureau of Prisons has so far released only five of the 837 Elkton inmates identified as medically vulnerable to home confinement, a move that drew rebuke from a federal judge in Cleveland this week. The American Civil Liberties Union has also sued the Bureau of Prisons over the issue.

Boone, who had called himself “Charles Grass,” fled to Canada after a 2008 indictment on federal drug charges in Kentucky and spent eight years on the loose until his capture in late 2016. He was sentenced in 2018 after pleading guilty to one count of conspiring to possess, grow and distribute more than 1,000 marijuana plants at an operation near Springfield, Kentucky.

Boone was convicted in the 1980s and spent a decade in prison for what prosecutors called a massive marijuana syndicate. They said he was head of a multistate marijuana operation known as the “Cornbread Mafia,” which had 29 farms in several states.

He was featured on the TV show “America’s Most Wanted,” spurring a Facebook page called Run, Johnny, Run.

In the age of coronavirus, local officials and NASA are split on whether that’s a good idea.

NASA and SpaceX are urging spectators to stay at home next Wednesday for safety reasons. Officials in Brevard County, home to the Kennedy Space Center, are rolling out the welcome mat in an effort to jump-start a tourism industry hit hard this spring by coronavirus-related lockdowns.

If people are comfortable coming and watching the launch, “by all means, come. If they aren’t, I respect that too,” said Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey.

“I’m not going to tell Americans they can’t watch a great piece of history. I’m just not going to do it,” he said.

The sheriff said he is asking visitors to practice social distancing as they watch the launch of astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken on a test flight of SpaceX’s Dragon crew capsule. Liftoff is set for 4:33 p.m. EDT.

Around 85 reserve deputies will be on hand to monitor crowds and ask people to comply with social distancing if they are in groups. A local chain of beach shops is distributing 20,000 masks to spectators in coordination with the sheriff’s office, Ivey said.

The sheriff, who grew up in Florida watching launches, wants a new generation to be able to experience the energy, excitement and feelings of patriotism that comes from watching a U.S. launch with astronauts.

“NASA is a true part of our history in Brevard County,” Ivey said.

Earlier this month, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine asked potential spectators to watch the launch online or on TV from home. The space agency is also offering a “virtual launch experience.”

NASA is doing its best to facilitate social distancing inside the Kennedy Space Center by limiting access, although it may be hosting two VIPS. Vice President Mike Pence says he plans to be there, and President Donald Trump said he’s thinking of attending.

The visitor center at Kennedy, usually a prime spot for viewing launches, is closed to the public.

NASA astronauts have not launched from the U.S. since the space shuttle program ended in 2011. It will be the first attempt by a private company to fly astronauts to orbit for the space agency.

“The challenge that we’re up against right now is we want to keep everybody safe,” Bridenstine said. “And so we’re asking people not to travel to the Kennedy Space Center, and I will tell you that makes me sad to even say it. Boy, I wish we could make this into something really spectacular.”.

Although crowd sizes varied, a high-profile space shuttle launch could attract a half million visitors to the Space Coast. Local tourism officials think next week’s launch will bring in no more than 200,000 spectators.

With airline passenger traffic drastically down and nearby Orlando theme parks closed because of the pandemic, “we’re not going to be getting the out-of-state traffic we may have gotten during the shuttle era,” said Peter Cranis, executive director of the Space Coast Office of Tourism.

“The environment is different with COVID and people now reemerging from stay-at-home orders,” Cranis said. “There are going to be a number of people who are hesitant.”

The Space Coast’s tourism business is down by about 40% for the year, and that could cost the area $1 billion, he said.

“A launch like this after a big long weekend could really give us a shot in the arm,” Cranis said.

Local hoteliers are looking forward to the influx of visitors after two bad months. Tom Williamson, who is general manager of two hotels on the Space Coast, each with 150 rooms or more, said one hotel was closed and the other only had 15% occupancy in April. He expects both hotels to be at or near capacity on the night of the launch.

“We’re glad to seem some signs of life,” Williamson said.

Steven Giraldo works as a technical consultant for a software company in St. Petersburg, Florida, but he has a side gig with some space-buff friends offering charter boat tours for watching launches. For next week’s SpaceX launch, he had booked around 150 people from as far away as Australia for $75 a head on a fleet of boats. He ended up scrapping those plans.

“It would take too much logistical effort to see if everyone is wearing a mask, making sure no one has a fever, and how to you social distance on a boat?” Giraldo said.

Instead, he plans to watch the launch with seven other friends, some from Arizona and Indiana, in a boat on the Banana River.

“This was going to be our biggest event. The historical significance of it created a lot of buzz,” Giraldo said. “But I just don’t know how we could have done it.”

Gretchen Whitmer announced Thursday she has lifted restrictions on retail businesses and auto dealerships across the state starting May 26, but visits must be made by appointment.

She also announced the state would lift restrictions on medical, dental and veterinary procedures deemed nonessential starting May 29.

The order will ease restrictions on gatherings, allowing for gatherings of 10 or fewer people, effective immediately.

""The data shows that Michigan is ready to phase in these sectors of our economy, but we must stay vigilant and ensure we’re doing everything we can to protect ourselves and our families from the spread of COVID-19,” Whitmer said.

Even with the lifting of some restrictions, Whitmer expects she will need to extend the stay-home order in the coming days. The extension would mean those businesses not included in the new orders — such as restaurants and gyms — would remain closed for a while longer downstate.

The extension of those restrictions will allow the state to gauge whether the loosening of other restrictions created a spike in coronavirus cases.

The Michigan Health and Hospital Association said Whitmer's announcement was a positive step for residents, who would be able to resume normal healthcare visits.

""Our member hospitals and health systems will continue to ensure that services offered adhere to strong safety, infection control and other COVID-19-related precautions,"" MHA CEO Brian Peters said in a statement. ""Hospitals are safe; please don’t delay care of any kind.""

She also urged residents ahead of Memorial Day weekend to practice proper safety protocol to prevent against a spread of the virus.

""Please remember to stay safe,"" she said. ""This virus is still present in Michigan.""

The easing comes the day before northern Michigan begins to restart restaurant and retail sales.

Whitmer and Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun urged residents to use proper safety protocol amid the lifted restrictions.

Businesses that are reopening must train workers on proper infection-control procedure and inform employees of a coronavirus case among staff.

Retail establishments also must consider curbside pick-up service to reduce traffic inside the store and decrease lines outside.

They're an oasis.

As COVID-19 continues to reshape our way of life, our homes have become shelters -- physically and emotionally -- during these uncertain times. And when you really live and work in a space week after week, the best spots, those where you feel most at ease, are those we turn to over and over again.

In my own home, there's a leather sofa in our home office where everything else disappears. A wall of built-in bookshelves is filled with my favorite books and other accents my husband and I have collected over the years. In this space, I don't worry about laundry, dishes or uncertainty about how the world will be different going forward. I can read a book, sip a cup of tea and find peace.

Each of us has an oasis in our homes -- a reading nook, the comfy end of the sofa in the living room, or an outdoor patio.

One of interior designer Jill Schumacher's favorite spots at her Ferndale home are two lounge chairs in her backyard.

""This is my salvation spot,"" said Schumacher, part of the Birmingham-based design firm, Rariden Schumacher Mio. ""As soon as the weather breaks I sit out in the yard to work on emails on my Ipad or laptop on these outrageously cozy Summer Classics chairs.""

I reached out to dozens of local interior designers to ask about their own oasis, or favorite spots of their own homes. Maybe you'll find inspiration for your own home.

A view of the courtyard

Corey Damen Jenkins is a busy interior designer with offices in Birmingham and New York but he's been at his Bloomfield Hills townhouse since mid-March.

He says if he has to have ""cabin fever"" anywhere, he's grateful it's at his place in Oakland County and not New York.

""My personal oasis is definitely my living room,"" he said. ""I've designed it in such a way to where it's perfect for curling up with a good book, watching Netflix or playing a board game. It features over-sized windows that overlook a lush courtyard, so I can observe nature and the Birmingham community while still 'sheltering in place' during this pandemic.""

A place to nap or read

One of interior designer Paul Feiten's favorite spots in his Bloomfield Hills home is a bedroom he converted into a sitting room. Framed pictures of flowers line the walls and there's ample room to stretch and read a magazine or take a nap. And one of the standout design elements? The floor.

""The room is very calming due to the wood floor that was painted a high gloss white with high gloss white solid wallpaper,"" said Feiten of Paul Feiten Designs. ""I thought schools paint red and white and black lines on a gym floor, why cant I just do the whole floor in white high gloss? So I called a gym floor company.""

Reading can sometimes lead Feiten to a design-filled nap.

""Sometimes I am really inspired by an article and it puts my mind in a dreamy and creatively inspired state and then I fall asleep so those images and articles can simmer away in my mind,"" said Feiten.

A multi-purpose office

There's a framed print in Rachel Nelson's home office in Grosse Pointe that says it all during these turbulent times: ""You Got This.""

Nelson is the owner and Chief Executive Officer of RL Concetti, a Metro Detroit interior design firm. Nelson's home office sums up her style in many ways and is her own oasis. It's a juxtaposition of modern and traditional styles. There's a desk for work but there's also also a sofa because it's where she goes to not just work but also meditate, journal and take care of her many plants.

A garden room

Linda Shears's garden room at her home in Troy is what she calls her ""ah"" room. Once a three-season Florida room, she had it completely redone two decades ago, expanding it and adding the curved glass windows, heat vents and the tile floor. She had the walls faux finished in an intense yellow.

Shears says her garden room is where she goes to meditate or just be.

And ""once Michigan’s weather maintains 70 degree days, I move all the plants outside and start using the table for breakfast or dinner,"" said Shears.

A spot by the fireplace

McCrumb is the owner of Catching Fireflies, a popular home decor and gift boutique with locations in Berkley, Rochester and Ann Arbor. McCrumb and her team have stayed busy during this quarantine with online orders.

Sunlight pours through the living room and McCrumb gets to put her feet up on the coffee table for a little bit near the fireplace.

""My cat, Maizy usually finds a way to snuggle up next to me too,"" said McCrumb. ""All these factors make this one of my favorite spots at home.""

Warm Vibes

Erica Harrison’s favorite spot in her Indian Village home is her solarium. Light fills the space; the botanical wallpaper is from House of Hackney. It’s where Harrison goes for her morning cup of coffee and where she feels most creative.

“In the winter we stay away because of the lack of warmth, but that room makes me feel such warm vibes,” said Harrison.

Big Sean is leading a group of Detroit artists and performers who will participate in a city-sponsored online event designed to help fight COVID-19 and raise awareness about the 2020 census.

The two-day streaming event, dubbed the Everybody VS COVID-19 Unity Festival, will be held 7-10 p.m. May 29 and 30 and will be broadcast on the City of Detroit's Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram pages.

Mayer Hawthorne, Sada Baby, La Britney, Gmac Cash and others will participate in the digital event, which borrows its name from Detroit Vs. Everybody creator Tommey Walker, who introduced an Everybody Vs. COVID-19 line of shirts and hoodies in March.

D-Nice, whose stature has grown during the pandemic due to his hugely popular Instagram Live DJ sessions, will also participate in the event. D-Nice is not a Detroiter but he has ties to the city, and he helped Kid Rock land his record deal in the late 1980s.

“In the spirit of Detroit, we are encouraging continued collaboration by celebrating our city and culture for two important and pressing causes,"" Eric Thomas, Chief Storyteller for the City of Detroit, said in a statement. ""Advocating for safety and awareness about COVID-19 and getting Detroiters to participate in the Census to ensure that we have all the resources we need going forward and in case we ever experience anything like this again.”

Portions of the broadcast will also play on the city's cable channels, according to a release.

Aside from that, ""everything is dramatically different,"" the WJBK-TV (Channel 2) news anchor says of working during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Like every other industry, the TV news business has been upended since mid-March when coronavirus became the story in America. Anchors are separated — sometimes by a newsroom, sometimes by miles — reporters are broadcasting from home and photographers are practicing social distancing guidelines with their subjects.

Newsrooms, once bustling with bodies, have been reduced to skeleton crews, while interviews that would normally take place in-person are now beamed across Skype and Zoom.

Perkins, who is co-anchoring evening broadcasts with an at-home Monica Gayle, says in normal times, he's used to there being anywhere from 225-250 people in Fox 2's Southfield headquarters. Now there's sometimes only four, ""and I'm the fourth,"" he says. ""It's incredible.""

Yet the show goes on. ""We are adapting,"" says Perkins, who has been with Fox 2 for nearly 25 years. ""We’re using our experience to get things done.""

Their efforts are being rewarded in the ratings department.

Viewership is up across the board for local news. At WDIV-TV (Channel 4), numbers from 4-8 p.m. are up 22% from a year ago, and year-to-year, ratings are up 70%, according to the station's vice president and general manager, Marla Drutz.

The rewards come as the various stations have had to employ new ways of working and reporters, producers, editors and on-air personalities have had to learn new skill sets on the fly.

Kevin Jeanes, the morning weatherman at WXYZ-TV (Channel 7), has been working from his Royal Oak home since late March.

In the newsroom, he's used to working off six computers; in his set-up at home, he has two laptops and two iPhones. The monitor he uses to communicate with the station is an old TV that he places in front of him during his morning remotes, which start every weekday at 4:30 a.m. and last through 9 a.m., at a rate of eight or nine per hour.

He's lit by a ring light he bought for $45 off Amazon and he broadcasts via an app on one of his phones from a back corner of his basement, which he outfitted with a few bookcases to look more like a home office and less like, well, the back corner of his basement. While he's doing local weather updates during cutaways from ""Good Morning America,"" his wife and 18-month-old son are upstairs sleeping.

Well, sometimes they're sleeping. ""My son can be kind of loud, and sometimes he'll be banging around upstairs and I know you can hear him on-air,"" Jeanes says. ""Yesterday morning, I changed his diaper during a commercial break.""

Jeanes, who's been giving himself haircuts since the lockdown began, also does call-ins with WKQI-FM's (Channel 955) ""Mojo in the Morning"" program; he does those from inside a storage closet, tucked between a mattress and some clothes.

He's making the most of the situation and enjoys being so close to his wife and child during a time of such great worldwide unease. What he misses most about going into the office is the camaraderie of his co-workers.

""It’s a little bit harder to have fun at work,"" Jeanes says. ""You're used to being around the buzz of the newsroom and a lot of people, and now I’m just in this quiet basement all by myself. And when you don't have people around you, it's hard to bring that high energy every morning, which is what people expect.""

Alex Atwell, a photographer for WDIV, is having to learn how to convey energy in his stories in a new way.

Under social distancing guidelines, he's filming interviews from at least six feet away using a long microphone, rather than having subjects fit with a small lavalier microphone, which clips on their shirts and allows for free movement — and with that, more visual possibilities for the Emmy-winning cameraman.

""For me, the lavalier is key to creative storytelling and active interviews, and that has been taken away,"" says Atwell, who has been with Channel 4 since 2008. ""We all have to think differently try to keep the quality up and be creative in different ways.""

Atwell is used to teaming up with a reporter, talking through a story on the way to an assignment and collaborating on its look and various story elements.

Since the pandemic began, Atwell now rides alone in his news truck and meets up with a reporter, who drives separately, at an assignment; afterward, they use transcription apps to pass files back and forth to each other, rather than working on something together hand-in-hand.

""For the most part, I’m the only one in my truck,"" Atwell says. At the beginning of his shift he spends up to 15 minutes wiping down everything in the truck: the heat shifters, lights, radio, steering wheel, seats, work stations, ""all kinds of other buttons,"" he says. ""You don't realize how many things you touch in a vehicle.""

And Atwell says he's the only person who handles his equipment. Even if it means more trips to and from his van, he'll haul his own tripod, mic stand and camera, and he stays six feet from everyone with whom he interacts.

His main goal, he says, is to limit exposure risk to COVID-19.

""It's an abundance of caution,"" says Atwell, who wears a mask at all times while working in the field. ""When I go out, I assume I have it and I assume the person I’m with has it. I take that mindset.""

From a practical standpoint, one of the biggest obstacles he currently faces is the lack of bathrooms at his disposal. He's used to driving around the city all day hopping between assignments, but now that most businesses are closed, he can't run into a McDonald's or a Starbucks and use the restroom facilities the way he's used to doing.

""You've either gotta hold it all day, or sometimes I can rush home,"" Atwell says.

Atwell — whose long-running ""Uniquely Detroit"" series, which highlight local citizens, artists and businesses doing positive things in the community, is currently on hold due to the pandemic — is also an example of the way Detroit's TV stations are working together during these unprecedented times. He was the cameraman during the town hall with Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on April 2 that was simulcast on Channels 2, 4 and 7.

Fox 2's Perkins anchored that broadcast along with Channel 4's Devin Scillian and Channel 7's Carolyn Clifford. Perkins says the collaboration between the three affiliates was a ""wonderful"" show of solidarity across network and competition lines. ""It was great for the community to see us all working together,"" he says.

Early on during the state's lockdown, Perkins elected to continue to come into the Fox 2 studio and be the familiarity that viewers could find at a time when so much of their lives had been overturned. ""I thought it was important that somebody be there,"" he says.

It hasn't been business as usual. He was initially coming home and sanitizing every piece of clothing he was wearing after his shifts, a process that is no longer as rigorous, he says.

Clockwise from top left: Monica Gayle, Sherry Margolis, Amy Lange, Roop Raj, Huel Perkins and Taryn Asher work from home and the newsroom. (Photo: Fox 2)

On-air, Perkins' Thursday night ""Let It Rip"" segments — which typically feature a panel of guests debating the topics of the day, the more spirited the better — are now conducted remotely, and the slight pauses and delays in connections make it harder to really let it rip. ""It's a conversation,"" Perkins says, ""and in-person is always better.""

Likewise, he's used to sitting next to his co-anchor, but now he'll text Gayle during breaks and downtime during the broadcast.

But he's still there, and that's what's important. The veteran anchor says he's heard from viewers who have told him he's helped make them feel less afraid, which was his intention.

""I want to be that calm, reassuring voice to let the viewers know that yes it's tough, yes it’s difficult, but we’re going to get through this,"" he says. ""It’s going to take some time. Not weeks, not months, maybe a year, but we're starting to realize we’re not going to return to exactly what we were.

""This is going to change our world. In a sense, we will never go back to what we were. But we will find a way through it.""

The coronavirus put an end to the careers of seniors Aasia Laurencin, Jayla Jones, Kourtney Kennard and N’Stajah Banks.

“It was tough because the kids worked really hard, ran cross country in the fall and most of them ran indoor track, so not being able to compete kind of put a damper in all of the work they put in,"" Jiles said. ""But at the end of the day the kids did understand that the health and safety of everybody is more important than sport. It was a good learning lesson, but at the same time it was a little painful as well.

“I had four senior girls who were contributors and three of them had decided on schools. Aasia is going to Texas, Jayla Jones is going to North Carolina A&T and Kourtney Kennard is going to the University of Memphis on an academic scholarship. They ran pretty well so it didn’t hurt them as bad as it would hurt some kids, but at the same time still not being able to compete and win state championships and national titles was kind of a rough day for them.

“We won three state titles in a row — 2014, 2015 and 2016 — were second in ’17, and then won again in ’18 and ’19, so we were trying to win three in a row again. It’s tough because usually good track programs last four years and then they top off. We were trying to keep it going.”

Jiles will have a talented lineup to work with next year in Chloe Vines, Morgan Atlas, Tamyra Todd and Jada Roundtree. Vines placed second in the Division 1 state meet in the 400 meters (54.22 seconds) and fifth in the 200 meters (24.97) as a freshman last year. Atlas placed fifth in the 300-meter hurdles (43.94) as a freshman. Todd placed seventh in the 400 meters (57.54) as a sophomore and Roundtree, who did not compete last season, was the indoor state champion in the 400 meters (55.81) this past winter.

But Jiles wanted to see Laurencin perform this spring after she placed second in the state the previous two years to White Lake Lakeland's Grace Stark, who was the fastest 100-meter hurdler in state history (13.16). Stark earned the title of 2020 Southeastern Conference Freshman of the Year as a member of the Florida Gators and broke the World U20 record in the 60-meter hurdles twice at the SEC Indoors (7.93 seconds, then 7.91).

“Aasia is a multi-time AAU Junior Olympic champion, an All-American in the hurdles and it’s just crazy because she had been running behind Grace Stark,"" Jiles said. ""It was finally her senior year and her turn to win a state title in her event, the 100 hurdles, but she didn’t have a season so that was real tough for her.

“Aasia finished second twice, as a sophomore and junior, when Grace Stark was the No. 1 hurdler in the nation. But Aasia is a smart kid. She’ll be very successful at Texas, has one of the best coaches in the world and she’s going to one of the better track schools in the nation, so things will work out.”

Laurencin had big plans, eyeing titles at the state meet in June as well as in the New Balance Nationals later in the summer. Now she plans to continue to train, then travel to Austin to begin her college career in August.

“It was heartbreaking but knew it was coming. You know the disappointment so I’m just getting ready for college now,"" said Laurencin who is the National Honor Society president, owns a 3.95 GPA and plans to major in Neuroscience or computer science at Texas. ""I'm going to (Farmington Hills) Harrison’s track to run, then I work out at home, have an area where I do core work and get on the bike. My mom helps since she’s a personal trainer.

“People know me for the 100-meter hurdles. I’m top three in the nation in the 60-hurdles and 100-hurdles. My next event specialty is the 200-meter dash where my (personal record) is 24.20, which is among the top in the Michigan all-time lists, and I ran the third fastest time ever in the hurdles, a 13.43.”

So why Texas?

“Coach Edrick Floreal is phenomenal. He coached the reigning world record holder in the 100-meter hurdles, Keni Harrison, who ran a 12.20 to break the world record. Their academics are amazing, and I love the warm weather,” Laurencin said. “University of Texas has been communicating and said the sports teams will return in August, so that’s the plan, to get there in August.”

Jones and Kennard were part of Oak Park’s winning 1,600-meter relay team last year — an MHSAA state meet record at 3 minutes, 45.13 seconds — while Jones also played a part in Oak Park’s 1,600- and 3,200-meter relay teams in 2018. Banks placed fourth in the 300 hurdles last year.

“Jayla was third last year in the Division 1 state championships in the 800. She was our best cross country runner in the fall and has developed into a leader as she got older,” Jiles said. “The crazy thing is I’ve known Jayla since she was a baby since her mom ran at (Detroit) Mumford with me. Ada (Jones) graduated from Mumford in ’97 so I’ve known Jayla since she was a little kid and I’m very proud of her.”

Jones was looking forward to taking official visits to Virginia Commonwealth, Norfolk State, Florida A&M and North Carolina A&T. She competed in the New Balance Outdoors at North Carolina A&T following the high school season last summer but did not take a tour of the school.

“I was looking forward to performing in an Oak Park uniform and I won’t be able to do that again,” Jones said. “I specialize in the 800 and just love running it. My best time is 2:12 and I really wanted to run a 2:10 or under and win state.”

Jones has been keeping busy running up to six miles a day to get ready for cross country this fall at A&T. She has a 3.6 GPA and plans to become a pharmacist.

On Tuesday, however, Central Michigan got there.

Central Michigan became the first Division I school in the state to eliminate an athletic program as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the immediate discontinuation of men's indoor and outdoor track and field — a decision that will save the university hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, but also one that leaves the athletic department out of compliance, having fallen under the minimum number of men's sports offerings.

The move affects 36 student-athletes, some of whom also run cross country, a program that remains.

""Every business, every industry is going through this right now,"" Alford said Tuesday afternoon on a conference call with reporters. ""As you come up with problems and issues, you've gotta find a solution.

""Right now, for our financial sustainability, this is the decision, the solution I came to.

""As an AD, it's probably the hardest thing of your life.""

Scholarships will be granted for the duration of a student's college career, if they choose to stay at CMU, and that includes incoming freshmen. Students who wish to transfer can do so without penalty. Two assistant-coaching positions also were eliminated.

Jenny Swieton oversaw the men's programs, and will remain on the job as head of women's track and field and men's and women's cross country.

The men's indoor and outdoor track and field programs had an annual budget of $629,798, which will be the long-time annual savings. In the short term, savings will be around $300,000 a year.

The decision leaves Central Michigan with 16 sports programs, the NCAA Division I minimum. Early in the COVID-19 crisis, five mid-major conferences, including the Mid-American Conference, sent the NCAA a memo asking for a temporary waiver for sports minimums, but the NCAA denied it.

It also leaves Central Michigan with five men's teams, one below the NCAA Division I requirement. Alford has been working with the NCAA on a temporary waiver, and expects an answer soon, perhaps as early as Wednesday. If the NCAA doesn't approve the waiver, Alford said he has a fallback plan, but didn't elaborate.

""I have various models to make sure we're in full compliance this year,"" Alford said.

Colleges across the country have been scrambling to get their books in order amid the COVID-19 crisis, which has shut down sports for sevearl weeks and left athletic departments bracing for massive cuts. The cancellation of the NCAA Tournament cost mid-major schools like Central critical six-figure paydays. Projected declining enrollment is a major concern, as well.

Earlier this month, Central Michigan announced that Alford was taking an 8% pay cut, and the school's three highest-paid coaches — Jim McElwain (football), Keno Davis (men's basketball) and Heather Oesterle (women's basketball) — would see 6% pay cuts. Western Michigan recently announced similar pay cuts, and also Tuesday, Eastern Michigan said its football and basketball coaches would get 7% salary reductions.

Central Michigan joins other Mid-American Conference schools Akron (men's cross country, men's golf, women's tennis) and Bowling Green (baseball) in cutting sports. Additionally, the MAC announced the elimination of several postseason conference tournaments, and scaled-down basketball tournaments.

Alford said there are no plans to cut additional sports teams, but also said there's little to no chance of men's track ever being brought back, even if the financial outlook improves in the coming years.

In his conference call with reporters, Alford choked up multiple times talking about the student athletes.

""We've been trying to make it work,"" said Alford, who has been bouncing between six and seven different budget models. ""It's just impossible to make it work without this reduction.""

The last Division I school in Michigan to eliminate teams was Eastern in March 2018, axing men's swimming and diving and wrestling, and women's tennis and softball. A lengthy court case forced Eastern to reinstate women's tennis, and it is in the process of adding women's lacrosse to substitute for softball.

Less than two weeks later, on March 16, Carl's Golfland's two brick-and-mortar locations were effectively shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic

""My life flipped on the 5th of March,"" said Carl Rose Jr., ""and it flipped again on the 16th.""

The two life-altering dates forever will be intertwined, as far as Junior is concerned, especially as he tries to make the best of a situation that's been rotten for millions of businesses throughout the nation and world.

Carl's Golfland has kept all 180 of its employees on the payroll, and has donated more than $350,000 to hospitals and charities, mostly in Southeast Michigan, but also some nationally.

It's all part of Rose's #ShankThisVirus Campaign, which drew national notoriety Sunday when he got a shoutout on NBC during golf's return-to-live-action charity exhibition featuring Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson, Rickie Fowler and Matthew Wolff. On Sunday morning, given his long-standing relationship with event sponsor TaylorMade, Rose decided to add a $100,000 donation to the exhibition's purse.

""Mom and Dad started this in 1958, the year I was born, and Southeast Michigan and the country has been so good to my family and my business. I've been very, very fortunate,"" Rose said over the phone Tuesday. ""It just felt right to me. My mother and father, I know what type of people they were, and how they would look at this, and it just felt right to me. I wanted to try and make a difference.

""I started thinking about what Mom and Dad would do. They were very generous people, even when they were small.

""We've all gotta help each other.""

Carl's Golfland has two shops, in Bloomfield Hills and Plymouth, which are among the most acclaimed golf-apparel outfits in the country.

They do huge business, particularly in the spring months, as Michigan's estimated half-million recreational golfers gear up for the season.

This year, though, the shops suffered significant financial damages, with the stores being forced closed since mid-March. Rose and his staff installed curbside pickups for online sales, but that only made up for about 15 percent of the typical business. It's popular Demo Days were canceled.

Only recently has Carl's Golfland been allowed to open its ranges and its fitting stations, and give lessons.

But Rose still made the commitment to keep his staff, and fund the charity, which in Michigan has helped Gleaners Food Bank, Detroit Public Safety Foundation, Henry Ford Health System, St. Joseph Mercy Oakland Hospital, Hurley Medical Center, DMC Detroit Receiving Hospital, SAY Detroit and the American Red Cross, plus a couple initiations outside the state, including the New York City Fire Department Foundation and The Beacon in Houston.

The donation during the NBC broadcast of the golf exhibition — one of the first live televised sporting events since mid-March, joining NASCAR, which returned Sunday — supports the American Nurses Foundation and CDC Foundation.

""We're banged up, we're bruised, and it's gonna be a while until we're not,"" Rose said. ""This is something that's gonna have repercussions for years to come.

""You get one bruise and that heals up, and you've got another one. But I think we're gonna be one of the lucky ones. My heart bleeds for many people in our country, businesses you know aren't gonna come back.""

Golfers can purchase a #ShankThisVirus t-shirt at carlsgolfland.com, with all proceeds — the entire $18 cost of the shirt — going to charity, thanks to Carl's Golfland, founded by Carl and Donna Rose as a small driving range in Pontiac.

Among notable golfers who have joined the #ShankThisVirus campaign are LPGA players Lexi Thompson, Morgan Pressel and Maria Fassi, and LPGA legend Annika Sorenstam.

The electric-vehicle maker announced the provision along with plans to reinstate its attendance policy starting Friday. Employees who are concerned they might expose an at-risk member of their household can sign and submit a document to take leave until May 31, Valerie Capers Workman, Tesla’s head of North American human resources, wrote in the memo viewed by Bloomberg News.

Workers who Tesla or a doctor have told to quarantine, or have Covid-19 symptoms or have tested positive for the coronavirus are not subject to the attendance policy, Capers Workman said. Her memo applied to workers at the company’s auto plant in Fremont, California, and its battery factory near Reno, Nevada.

Tesla restarted production at the Fremont facility last week in defiance of a county shutdown order. Days after Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk tweeted that the company would breach local rules and that he was willing to risk arrest, Tesla told employees the county’s health official had approved its safety plans and procedures.

On Wednesday, Tesla abandoned the lawsuit the company filed 11 days earlier against the county over its health order.

But in this crisis, things are different. This time cash itself, passed from hand to hand across neighborhoods, cities and societies just like the coronavirus, is a source of suspicion rather than reassurance.

No longer a thing to be shoved mindlessly into a pocket, tucked into a worn wallet or thrown casually on a kitchen counter, money's status has changed during the virus era — perhaps irrevocably. The pandemic has also reawakened debate about the continued viability of what has been the physical lifeblood of global economies: paper money and coins.

From the supermarkets of the United States and Japan to the shantytowns of Africa to the gas stations of Tehran, a growing number of businesses and individuals worldwide have stopped using banknotes in fear that physical currency, handled by tens of thousands of people over their useful life, could be a vector for the spreading coronavirus.

Public officials and health experts have said that the risk of transferring the virus from person to person through the use of money is minimal. That hasn't stopped businesses from refusing to accept currency, and some countries from urging citizens to stop using banknotes altogether.

In the midst of the coronavirus era, a thousand calculations are made before cash is handled — mostly with gloved hands. Some leave the money laid out on surfaces for days, for the virus to die. Others disinfect banknotes with spray. Some even microwave them in the belief it kills the virus. In China, banks are now required to sterilize cash with ultraviolet light or heat, then store notes for at least a week before they are given to customers.

“In many areas, cash was already beginning to disappear due the increased risk of robbery, the ease of internet ordering, and the ubiquity of cell phones,” says Zachary Cohle, an assistant professor at the department of economics at Quinnipiac University in Connecticut.

“Cash,” Cohle says, “now carries an extra stigma.”

But is ditching cash altogether even feasible?

Sweden, Finland, Norway, Canada and others have slowly phased out cash to the point where using it in large amounts seems suspicious. The United Kingdom and Australia are among countries expected to become cashless societies. And in China, use of cash by consumers has plunged as smartphone-based payment services rose in popularity over the past decade.

But for much of the rest of the world, letting go of cash is difficult if not impossible.

'Cash ist fesch!'

Humans have a centuries-old emotional relationship with physical money that is difficult to erase.

“Currency represents value that we can hold in our hands. Cash provides a way for us to translate a day’s work into something tangible and easily traded,” Cohle says. “We may not know what goods we will need in the future. However, holding money allows for us to feel as though we can buy whatever goods we will need.”

“Cash ist Fesch” is a common saying in Austria and southern Germany. The phrase, which literally means cash is beautiful, reflects both countries' attachment to cash — and not just among the older generation or those who worry about the loss of privacy that comes with cashless payments, but also among some younger people who see it as a status symbol.

“I always pay with cash — as a matter of principle!” Ingel Strobl, a 76-year-old pensioner, says while shopping at a bakery in central Vienna. “I know they want to abolish cash. But I don’t want that we lose our right to our own money. You know what I mean anyway! I stick to cash — corona or not.”’

Since the virus outbreak, however, shops that have remained open, like grocery stores, have posted signs encouraging people to pay with cards. Many are: According to Germany’s central bank, the Bundesbank, 43% of people have changed their payment behavior in the past few weeks; now, a large percentage are likely to make contactless payments with a card.

Japan, for its sophisticated reputation, is also a solid believer in cash, which makes up for 53% of a household’s assets, according to the Bank of Japan. The belief in “cash is king” reigns, though the country has had zero interest rates for two decades, far longer than the rest of the developed world.

But the threat of the coronavirus could be the impetus the nation needed to move toward going cashless, said Hiroki Maruyama, who heads the Fintech Association of Japan, a nonprofit that supports innovation in financial services.

“The culture,"" he says, ""is slowly changing.”

Cash in a crisis

“Cash combined with courage in a crisis is priceless,” billionaire investor Warren Buffett says.

In crisis-hit countries and parts of the world gripped by conflict or inflation, cash is still carried in thick wads for simple shopping expeditions.

In Lebanon, as the economic situation deteriorated late last year and the fear of banks collapsing mounted, many people began saving cash in their homes. The sale of home safes surged. An estimated $3 billion was withdrawn and stashed at home, according to the governor of the country's Central Bank.

As banks imposed capital controls, trips to the bank to withdraw foreign currency — followed by a trip to one of the ubiquitous exchange shops to change money on the black market — became the norm for many Lebanese.

“All I do is handle cash all day,” said one money changer in Beirut, who insisted on being identified by his first name, Ihsan. He said he feared unwanted attention from authorities.

“I wear gloves. But honestly? Corona is the last thing on people’s minds right now,"" Ihsan said. “All they’re thinking about is how to handle this crisis and get money to live.”

In this May, 2, 2020, photo, a man uses banknotes to pay for his purchases at the mall in Basra, Iraq. (Photo: Nabill al-Jurani, AP)

In Iran, one of the world’s worst coronavirus hotspots, there are no international bank cards, like Visa or Mastercard, because of U.S. sanctions. Many were surprised at the new banners that appeared at some gas stations in Tehran: “Service is only for those who will pay by debit cards.”

In Venezuela, it is common to see bolivars littering the streets because the local currency has lost its value.

“The truth is that I haven’t had any bolivars in my wallet for a long time,” said Fátima Figueras, a 32-year-old office worker, waiting in line to enter a Caracas pharmacy. “What worries me most is having to hand my debit card to a cashier who touches it,” said Figueras, wearing a facemask against the coronavirus.

Cash still rules in West and Central Africa even with the growth in regional banking options and mobile money service providers. Monthly banking account fees are prohibitive for many, and the self-employed often keep their savings at home in hard currency. ATM machines often don’t work.

Dorothy Harpool, director of student and community initiatives and lecturer at Wichita State University's W. Frank Barton School of Business, predicted the pandemic would lead some consumers to rethink their use of cash. But going completely cashless, she says, is a long way off.

“Until everyone and every country has reliable access to the internet, I do not believe the pandemic will singularly change past practices,” Harpool said. In particular, cash transactions are also likely to remain for businesses operating under the radar of government and other regulatory bodies.

Ihsan, the Beirut money changer, said there are certain things you just can’t do without cash — particularly in a dysfunctional and developing nation.

“Like how else can you bribe a government employee to get your business done? With a credit card?”

The Minneapolis company reported Wednesday that comparable-store sales, which include online purchases, rose 10.8% for the three-month period that ended May 2.

That was fueled by a 12.5% jump in the number of items customers bought with each trip to the store as families made major restocking runs, but fewer of them.

“Last quarter was unlike anything I have ever seen,” Target's CEO Brian Cornell told reporters on a conference call. “It was intense. It was volatile. It was stressful for our guests and for the country.""

In this April 6, 2020 file photo, a customer wearing a mask carries his purchases as he leaves a Target store during the coronavirus pandemic, in the Brooklyn borough of New York. (Photo: Mark Lennihan, AP)

The pandemic has widened an already growing rift between companies that deftly followed consumers online, and those that have struggled.

J.Crew, Stage Stores, Neiman Marcus, and J.C. Penney have all sought bankruptcy protection in recent weeks.

A years-long campaign by Walmart and Target to challenge Amazon.com online was, as it turns out, a dry run for the pandemic.

Target had already transformed its 1,800 stores into distribution hubs, putting it in a better position than even Amazon.com to keep supplies flowing.

Target's stores were directly involved in supplying goods for 80% of online sales. Same-day services, such as curbside pickup at stores for things ordered online, nearly tripled.

The company has 5 million new users on its website, and 2 million have begun relying on Target's services like curbside pickup for things ordered online.

Target picked up market share in all five of its merchandise categories, Cornell said. Sales of items like furniture and electronics surged 20%. It was the same for groceries.

Clothing sales, a high-margin category for retailers, slipped during the quarter, but that business began to rebound at the tail end of the quarter. Cornell cites government stimulus checks for that late bump in discretionary spending.

It is unclear if other retailers, particularly those that are still closed, saw the same uptick with the arrival of those checks.

As with other retail companies operating in a pandemic, costs soared as well. Target spent and additional $500 million on things directly related to the outbreak. It's bumped up hourly pay for workers by $2. It has now extended emergency pay for those workers to July 4. Target also spent money to sanitize stores and warehouses, new protections for workers an signage for customers to ensure social distancing.

Cornell said those costs will be the new reality going forward.

“There is going to be a premium on creating a safe sanitized shopping environment,"" he said. Shopping while minimizing human contact is the new normal, he said, referring to drive-up and curbside pickup.

Target reported an 11.3% increase in revenue, which hit $19.62 billion for the quarter. Analysts surveyed by FactSet expected $19.02 billion. Net earnings slid 64% to $284 million, or 56 cents, or 59 cents when adjusted for non-recurring events. That's far better than the per-share profit of 44 cents that Wall Street was expecting, according to a survey of analysts by FactSet.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel broke with her country’s longstanding opposition to raising money together with other - often poorer - EU countries. But the proposal made with French President Emmanuel Macron is limited in scale and duration, which could help her sell it to skeptics back home.

It consists of 500 billion euros ($550 billion) in loans and grants to help countries through the recession, and is viewed by some as a step toward stronger EU ties as the 27-country union faces challenges not just from the virus crisis, but from populist forces in member countries Hungary and Poland who want to loosen the bloc’s ties.

France, whose president had pushed hard for the fund proposal announced Monday, exulted. “It’s a historic breakthrough,” said Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire on Tuesday. “We will be able to support the economic recovery in the countries most hit by the virus.”

“The second consequence is political: France and Germany affirm loud and clear their determination to see solidarity among European Union members placed at the heart of the European construction,” he said, calling it “a historical step for the whole European Union.”

Macron and Merkel suggested that the fund would send money starting in 2021 to the areas hardest hit by the virus outbreak and target sectors that are priorities for EU economic policy such as digitalization and fighting climate change.

The fund would be a one-off part of the EU’s budget and take advantage of EU institutions’ ability to borrow at extremely low interest rates for long periods. It adds to a 540 billion-euro package agreed among finance ministers from the 19 EU countries that use the euro. That included loans from the eurozone bailout fund that would have to be repaid.

The proposal remains a proposal, and key elements such as joint borrowing have been resisted by northern European countries such as Austria, Finland and the Netherlands. Until Monday, opponents also tended to include Germany, although Merkel had kept her comments vague on exactly how the recovery fund was to be funded.

The fund touches on broad issues of European integration and underlines the union’s lack of a central financial authority like those that exist at the national level. Germany, which has run a string of budget surpluses in recent years, has long resisted anything that smacks of its taxpayers being on the hook for the spending in less fiscally solid countries such as Italy.

The EU countries already borrow together in a limited way through their development bank and bailout fund, but that money is for loans, not given as grants. The EU already spends money on economic development projects in member states through a budget that amounts to about 1% of GDP, leaving the vast bulk of government spending at the national level.

It is not clear how the northern European opposition would be reconciled, or how the French-German proposals would be incorporated into the recovery plan being developed by the European Union’s executive Commission and due to be sketched out May 27. A commission spokesman said Thursday its proposal would include both grants and loans.

Nonetheless, as the two biggest countries in the EU, Germany and France are regarded as the chief political motor in the EU when they decide to work together.

Opponents of shared debt remained subdued on Tuesday. Finland’s finance ministry said it needed to study the proposal. Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz tweeted that “our position remains unchanged,” saying he had discussed the matter with Denmark, the Netherlands and Sweden.

Since the proposal is for a one-time fund during a crisis, it would represent incremental change. But some were seeing it as potentially the harbinger of more EU central spending.

“Crucially, these funds would be passed on to member states as grants rather than loans and according to need, implying a fiscal transfer between countries,” wrote Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economic in an email. “But there is a lot of opposition to such a change, not least within Germany itself, so that is far from certain. And in the meantime, fiscal transfers will be small compared to the cost of the virus.”

Reluctance by Germany and other countries to sharing the burden of the economic recovery from the pandemic - which was no European country’s fault - provoked angry responses in heavily indebted Italy. Economists have expressed concern that Italy will come out of the crisis with even more debt and could face a financial crisis that would destabilize the wider region.

“Whether the recovery fund – if and when it is finally agreed – will help to dispel this impression and thus curtail the tail risk that a disaffected Italy may turn more euro-sceptic over time remains to be seen,” said Holger Schmieding, chief economist at private bank Berenberg. “But egged on by France, Germany is now taking the political risks sufficiently serious.’

The Commerce Department said Tuesday that ground breakings plummeted 30.2% last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 891,000. That is the lowest level since February 2015. Construction of single-family homes dropped 25.4% to an annual rate of 650,000.

No region was spared. Housing starts dropped 43.6% in the Northeast, 14.9% in the Midwest, 26% in the South and 43.4% in the West.

“The monumental decline in home construction activity in April was widely expected, but the decline is breathtaking nevertheless,” said Matthew Speakman, economist for the real estate firm Zillow. “”The monthly decline in housing starts was easily the largest on record.”

The lockdowns and travel restrictions designed to contain the pandemic have brought economic life to a near standstill. The unemployment rate is 14.7%, highest since the Great Depression.

Commerce reported a 8.1% drop in the completion of homes under construction, which means many are being left half built.

The construction slump is likely to continue. Building permits for new housing dropped 20.8% to an annual rate of 1.07 million.

Gretchen Whitmer’s announcement Monday of a partial reopening of those regions starting Friday.

“I’m very confident,” said Amanda Danielson, a co-owner of Italian restaurant Trattoria Stella in Traverse City. “We put all of our safety protocols in place as if we were receiving guests knowing that eventuality. We feel very prepared to be able to do so in a safe manner.”

Traverse City is located in one of 17 northern Michigan counties that — along with the entire Upper Peninsula — will see lessened restrictions on Friday.

Whitmer’s plan reopens retail businesses and offices as well as bars and restaurants operating at 50% capacity. Employees must be trained on safety protocols.

“Obviously our biggest concern is the safety of our staff,” Danielson said. “We’re not a hotspot up here. We’ve had every few cases relatively speaking, which why we’re able to reopen, but at the same time the people that come here are from high-infected areas… Stella will look a little different until the scare of the virus is gone.”

Danielson said they’ve shifted the floor plan of the restaurant and cordoned off seating. Seating will only be available through reservations.

The relaxed rules represent a major step for restaurants, said Justin Winslow, president and CEO of the Michigan Restaurant & Lodging Association. The organization recently provided restaurateurs a roadmap to reopening that addresses sanitation, customer health and social distancing.

“What happens in these two regions is going to help set the stage for what we hope is a quick reopening for the rest of the state…” Winslow said. “Even if you’re not in one of those two regions, it’s a sign of hope. It’s a tangible specific date certain that we know a restaurant will have the opportunity to demonstrate that they can operate safely.""

In Sault Ste. Marie, Laurie Jarvie of gift shop Field and Forage said she’s excited to open her doors to customers again. She’s been operating her business through online sales, delivery and curbside pickups.

Jarvie said she was surprised by the governor’s decision for a partial reopening. She notes the low number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Chippewa County which includes Sault Ste. Marie. Since its last report last week there were seven confirmed cases in the county.

“I feel like the rest of the state really got punished because of the way things were downstate…” Jarvie said.

Jeff Bladzik, co-owner of the Painted Lady Saloon in Manistee, will continue to run the dining portion of the business as carryout only and allow drinkers at the bar.

“We’ve been doing to-go through this whole thing and we just feel it will add a lot of chaos to us if we’re trying to do in-house,” he said. “If the amount of takeout stays at the level it is, we won’t be able to handle it both ways because of the limited space we have in our kitchen.""

Warren Call, president and CEO of Traverse Connect, which merged with the Traverse City Area Chamber of Commerce in 2019, said his organization has advocated for the phased reopening announced by Whitmer on Monday because nearly half of his area's employees are in the hospitality and healthcare sectors.

""It's only a handful of industries, but it's an important step in the process,"" he said. ""It's always amazing how flexible entrepreneurs are. We've seen great pivots for businesses adding curbside, take out, catering and now they can add to that partial re-openings that will only help them get enough cash flow to make it work. We're making sure every sector is prepared when they get their shot.""

Rich Studley, president and CEO of the Michigan Chamber of Commerce, said the phased re-opening is ""long overdue"" and ""should have happened weeks ago.""

""It's been clear the COVID outbreak is subsiding in Michigan,"" he said. ""There's a lot of good people in the (Whitmer) administration, but there's not a lot of people in the administration who have ever owned and operated a business.""

Studley said the next few weeks will be critical for seasonal businesses.

""This is when you have soft openings,"" he said. ""This is when they stock the shelves. This is when they do trainings. If you're a hospitality business in the U.P. and you're not open by Memorial Day ... in many cases, they only have June, July and August to earn the revenue need for the year.""

Bill Golden, co-president of Golden Shoes on Traverse City's Front Street, said his business has been down 96% since he started doing curbside orders only on March 20. He's been planning for the day when his business was cleared to reopen.

""I have all my (personal protective equipment),"" he said. ""Masks, gloves. Two weeks ago I had the carpets cleaned. I said I want to be ready when it's time to go.

""The only thing I don't have is signs for distancing and I pick those up tomorrow,"" Golden continued. ""I have my thermometer. Every one of my employees is going to have their temperature taken when they come through the door.""

Tina Schuett, owner of the Rare Bird Brewpub in Traverse City, is not ready to re-open right away.

""We're not going to open until the 28th just to make sure we're keeping our staff and patrons safe,"" she said. ""We kind of want to let the first wave pass by and then we'll jump in.""

Schuett is also worried about a potential influx of out-of-towners from areas of the state that will still be closed.

""The scariest thing to us is the fact that people from downstate, in the higher-risk zones, are going to be coming up here now,"" she said. ""It seems like a guarantee that we will see an increase in cases up here when it happens.""

Instead, Hampton, like thousands of other autoworkers heading back to plants after an eight-week pandemic-induced shutdown, kept driving to work on Monday — the first step in the historic restart of an industry that accounts for nearly 4% of the nation’s economy.

""The factory is the most cross-contaminated workplace next to a buffet. Period,"" said Hampton, 39, of Detroit, who installs seats. ""There is no way to make it coronavirus-proof.""

Most workers at FCA Warren Truck came prepared for a restart under new safety guidelines, with masks already strapped around their faces. But many expressed concern and frustration about going back to work when uncertainty about the virus remains.

How successful the resumption of auto production ultimately will be, will depend in large part on whether Ford Motor Co., Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and General Motors Co. can keep their employees safe at work. Workers who returned to work Monday expressed a mixture of optimism and skepticism that it will be possible to prevent COVID-19 from spreading in manufacturing plants.

Hampton's concerns weren't eased after the eight-hour shift. He kept thinking about that message from the former first lady telling him the importance of staying home to stay safe, he said: ""This is unreal. We are going back to work to build a truck while Michelle Obama is telling us to stay home.""

Meanwhile, work was ""pretty smooth"" at Ford Motor Co.’s assembly and stamping plants in Wayne, said MaryLisa Poole, 57, of Canton Township, who works as a receiver for trucks delivering materials: ""As far as the virus, (there's) nothing to mention. I wore my mask. I had my face shield.”

The restart of vehicle production at GM, Ford and FCA, one week after major suppliers resumed production, is the linchpin of an unprecedented and coordinated effort to rev up almost the entire auto industry, foreign and domestic, after the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic and government responses to it.

""It’ll be the first time in history everybody comes back up at the same time,"" Gary Johnson, Ford's chief manufacturing and labor affairs officer, told The Detroit News last week. ""So that will be a test.""

The restart will test the new health and safety protocols the automakers have developed and implemented already in China, in Europe and in U.S. plants producing medical equipment and supplies. How effective those protocols prove to be should help ease anxieties of those returning to work.

Hampton reserved some of his criticism for the UAW, saying: ""I am little taken back because I thought there would be resistance from the union because of this pandemic."" To him, there's no logic in going back into a plant to build trucks with new cases still cropping up: ""If the numbers decrease, then I would see more reasoning into bringing us back.""

Michigan on Monday confirmed 24 deaths tied to the virus, marking the ninth straight day with fewer than 100 new deaths from the illness reported in the state. Monday was the fourth consecutive day that the state had fewer than 800 new cases of COVID-19, for a total 51,915 known cases since reporting began, according to state data.

But while the UAW can advocate for stronger health and safety protections, the contracts between the union and the automakers give the companies the final say on when production resumes, UAW spokesman Brian Rothenberg said.

""The UAW will continue to do everything we can to protect the health and safety of all members as plants reopen,"" the UAW said in a statement Sunday, noting that the union continues to advocate for the automakers to test all workers for COVID-19 when testing becomes more widely available.

Prior to restarting, the automakers did not know exactly how many workers would return, or how many would be unable to work after answering questions about their potential exposure to the virus. But, Rothenberg said he heard from all three companies Monday that they had full staffing, and in some cases, more than expected. Absenteeism did not appear to be an issue.

In a statement, FCA said it was ""pleased"" with Monday's restart. The automaker brought back some 12,000 U.S. employees. ""Everyone followed the new protocols and our plants were fully staffed to start production,"" the company said. ""We are very confident that we have all the right protection measures in place to keep them all safe.""

As they shuffled back into work Monday morning, however, some employees at the Warren Truck plant were not quite as convinced. More than 1,280 workers were called back to work there for the first shift from 5 a.m. to 1 p.m. A second shift is scheduled to restart in a few weeks.

At least one worker was sent home after answering ""yes"" to being exposed to the coronavirus.

Theresa Segura, 61, of Lincoln Park recently saw her brother, who has tested positive for the virus. She'll have to get tested now before she can go back to work, which is fine with her because she doesn't want to get any of her co-workers sick: ""There's a lot of other people out here sick already, and you don't want another life to pass away.""

Segura knew some of FCA Warren Truck workers who died from COVID-19 complications. At least four Warren Truck employees have died after contracting the coronavirus, prompting heightened anxiety among employees at the plant about returning to work.

""Everybody should be tested before they go in the plant because you can go in the plant and get sick and you don't know it,"" said Segura. ""You are risking your life to go in there.""

Not all employees will be tested for COVID-19, though the companies are offering testing through their medical teams or partner health systems to employees who have symptoms of the virus.

FCA assembly worker Richard Werth, 56, of Redford Township, a 25-year employee of the Warren Truck plant, was not necessarily excited about coming back Monday after being off for two months. But he wasn't concerned because he's already ""been out and about.""

""It's no biggie as long as they take precautions,"" he said. ""Just be safe. Keep your hands clean. Keep your distance.""

Meanwhile, Harnett Weatherspoon, 34, of Detroit works in the trim department at FCA's Warren Truck. He was ""very fearful of coming to work"" because he believes it's not safe, despite new virus-related safety protocols.

""If you guys have to do all this, it's not safe for us to be in here,"" Weatherspoon said of the company's safety precautions. ""Why am I coming to work with this on?"" he asked, pointing to the black mask around his head.

An FCA employee at Sterling Heights Assembly plant who returned early to help prepare the plant for restart was also sent home Wednesday after testing positive for COVID-19, causing some concerns among the rank-and-file.

In a letter sent home to workers, Mark Stewart, the company's chief operating officer in North America, said workers were wearing the required face masks and safety glasses provided to them and that the company was continuing to strengthen its procedures.

Another complication for the industry, which provides hundreds of thousands of American jobs, is the potential for snarls in the supply chain. Already, Daimler AG said it was idling its Mercedes-Benz plant in Alabama, which had reopened in late April, due to a parts shortage. Having to shut down factories after reopening them is the last thing automakers and their suppliers want, according to experts, and is a strain on their capital.

Mexico accounts for almost 40% of imported auto parts. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced plans last Wednesday to begin a phased reopening in his country on Monday to coincide with many U.S. plants. After some confusion about when exactly plants there are allowed to reopen, the Mexican government clarified that plants can begin reopening this week after receiving approval for their safety plans.

""The industry shut down all at the same time,"" said Jeff Schuster, head of global vehicle forecasting for LMC Automotive. ""In terms of a parts shortage, that's still a risk. And all it takes is many outbreaks in a supplier plant or assembly plant for things to have to get re-evaluated.""

The companies are returning workers in phases. GM last week restarted production at three engine and propulsion plants to fill its supply pipeline but is recalling one shift at most of its assembly plants this week. Ford's three-shift plants are starting with two, and two-shift plants with one. Fiat Chrysler has said it is basing its ramp up on demand and will reduce jobs per hour to ensure safe distancing.

Workers will go through safety briefings at all of the companies before production resumes. The companies also have sent home fliers and packets with information on the return-to-work procedures.

“The last thing we want is to see a spike when the governor starts pulling back restrictions,” said Jim Glynn, GM's vice president of global workplace safety. “The reason we are sharing all of this information is because we want to be successful. Everybody has to make that decision: ‘Do I feel comfortable coming to work?’ We want everybody to feel comfortable.""

The automakers have installed plexiglass barriers, signs and other cues to help with social distancing in the plants. Ford is providing wristwatches that beep when employees get within 6 feet and that can help with contact tracing if a case is identified.

The automakers are having employees fill out questionnaires asking them about travel and if they are experiencing symptoms. GM and Ford also are checking temperatures with thermal cameras; FCA is providing temperature strips for employees to check daily at home.

The protocols will be a transition, company executives say, adding that plant management will continue to follow up with employees about questions and concerns throughout the week.

""Every human being, myself included, is going to have some anxiety,"" said Shaun Whitehead, Ford's director of manufacturing, transmission and driveline components, last week. ""We're going to give ourselves some time. ... There are a lot of very small things that we do differently now.""

I do not believe this is hyperbolic for the following reasons: massive unemployment, a restless, heavily armed citizenry and a government refusing or incapable of providing solutions.

A few weeks ago, we saw a preview of what could come when discontented citizens roamed the halls of the Michigan Capitol armed with assault rifles. Although the misspelled protest signs became the butt of late-night comics, the real signs were ominous. Most likely the men with assault rifles never had the courage to serve in the military, but they can still spew 45 deadly rounds in a minute. That was not free speech — it was intended to intimidate and threaten.

Throughout history (think Weimar Republic) political threats are a pre-cursor to real violence. It is true that only a fringe of society roams around with Confederate flags, and assault rifles, but it is also true that most of the rest us are profoundly anxious about the future. If history has taught us anything, it is that we need a massive government program to address those fears.

We need a COVID Marshall Plan.

As the number of unemployed exceed Great Depression levels, we should be reminded of what distinguished us from what happened in Germany and Italy: Roosevelt’s New Deal. What saved Europe from degenerating into chaos and despotism after WWII was the Marshall Plan. We need a massive jobs program with guaranteed income for working families to survive.

Employing people to track people who may have been exposed to COVID-19 will require over a million people. Industries can be retooled to produce PPE and therapeutics. Infrastructure projects could easily be accomplished with adequate protection for workers.

For service workers who cannot return to work in the foreseeable future, a guaranteed income would provide support until work becomes available. If we can give trillions to save corporations, we can spare a couple thousand per month for citizens to make us safe and to rebuild the country.

What we lack is any political leadership to design such a plan.

We are already in social turmoil. The militia types obviously have no fear of parading their threats in public. The economy will not recover soon. A predictable second wave of infection (with much more severe consequences) will cause citizens to drift toward the political extremes.

Instead of leaving Americans to sit at home watching endless news of doom while facing disastrous debt, why not put our country to work and really focus on a better future?

But even in the best-case scenario, if a new administration begins on January 20, the new president will be required to take bold steps to ensure that the United States will never again be so unprepared for a crisis.

Secrecy and misinformation from the highest levels of government have worsened the effect of COVID-19. And although sunlight may not be the best disinfectant when it comes to the coronavirus, shining a light on our response, and guaranteeing transparency around future preparedness, will begin to treat the disease that has infected our democratic institutions.

Once a vaccine or treatment is in sight, it may be tempting to put the coronavirus era behind us. But failure to take a hard look at our response is naive and dangerous and will leave us vulnerable to similar or worse outcomes in the future.

A nonpartisan 9/11-type commission must detail what went wrong and what we could do better if faced with another crisis, and the results of such an inquiry must be made public. To facilitate a greater understanding of the United States’ response to the pandemic, the next administration must also declassify and release COVID-19 information that was inappropriately classified by the current president. There can be no coverup. And if corruption or deliberate wrongdoing tainted this administration’s response to the pandemic, there must be accountability.

In the midst of this crisis, much is unknown. Will we get sick? Are our jobs secure? What will our communities look like when it is safe to return to some semblance of normal life? But where there is information that should be known — facts related to the science of the virus, our preparedness, and the impact of the outbreak — it is incumbent upon our leaders to inform the public.

Lisa Rosenberg is the executive director of Open The Government, a non-partisan government transparency and accountability coalition. She wrote this for InsideSources.com.

The Dearborn Truck Plant, where Ford assembles the F-150 and Raptor pickups, halted production Wednesday after an employee there tested positive for the virus, Kelli Felker, Ford's global manufacturing and labor communications manager, said in a statement. Production is expected to resume Wednesday night.

""When a Dearborn Truck Plant employee who returned to work this week tested positive for COVID-19, we immediately began to notify people known to have been in close contact with the infected individual and asked them to self-quarantine for 14 days,"" Felker said. ""We are deep cleaning and disinfecting the work area, equipment, team area and the path that the team member took.""

In Chicago, two employees who returned to work this week tested positive for the virus. The same protocols were applied in those cases, and Chicago Assembly now is running again. Due to the known incubation time of the virus, Ford said ""we know (these employees) did not contract COVID-19 while at work.""

The cases illustrate the potential perils of restarting production amid the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed more than 5,000 lives in Michigan. Autoworkers employed by Detroit's automakers returned to work Monday following an eight-week shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.

At facilities operated by all three companies, employees must follow stringent health and safety protocols that are designed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in plants. Those protocols include wearing personal protective equipment, having their temperatures checked before entering, and daily health self-certifications.

While COVID-19 testing is not available to the entire workforce of any of the automakers, all are making testing available to employees who are experiencing symptoms of the virus or who believe they have been exposed to it. Ford, for example, has contracts with health systems in major metro areas where it operates. In southeast Michigan, the Blue Oval is partnering with Beaumont Health on testing.

General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said Wednesday they have not been forced to stop production at their plants. Starting and stopping production is costly and something automakers would prefer to avoid — except for potential health and safety concerns.

Monday's resumption of production was the first time that the entire global automotive supply chain and major automakers all came back online at once, posing a major test to the industry. After a two-month shutdown in which the automakers bled billions of dollars, the goal has been to make the restart process as smooth as possible.

""When a Dearborn Truck Plant employee who returned to work this week tested positive for COVID-19, we immediately began to notify people known to have been in close contact with the infected individual and asked them to self-quarantine for 14 days,"" Felker said. ""We are deep cleaning and disinfecting the work area, equipment, team area and the path that the team member took.""

In Chicago, two employees who returned to work this week tested positive for the virus. The same protocols were applied in those cases, and Chicago Assembly now is running again. Due to the known incubation time of the virus, Ford said ""we know (these employees) did not contract COVID-19 while at work.""

The cases illustrate the potential perils of restarting production amid the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed more than 5,000 lives in Michigan. Autoworkers employed by Detroit's automakers returned to work Monday following an eight-week shutdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.

At facilities operated by all three companies, employees must follow stringent health and safety protocols that are designed to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 in plants. Those protocols include wearing personal protective equipment, having their temperatures checked before entering, and daily health self-certifications.

While COVID-19 testing is not available to the entire workforce of any of the automakers, all are making testing available to employees who are experiencing symptoms of the virus or who believe they have been exposed to it. Ford, for example, has contracts with health systems in major metro areas where it operates. In southeast Michigan, the Blue Oval is partnering with Beaumont Health on testing.

General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said Wednesday they have not been forced to stop production at their plants. Starting and stopping production is costly and something automakers would prefer to avoid — except for potential health and safety concerns.

Monday's resumption of production was the first time that the entire global automotive supply chain and major automakers all came back online at once, posing a major test to the industry. After a two-month shutdown in which the automakers bled billions of dollars, the goal has been to make the restart process as smooth as possible.

The announcement came as Ford, as well as General Motors Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV, prepare to restart auto production on Monday after an eight-week shutdown prompted in part by rank-and-file workers who were concerned about the disease spreading in plants.

In southeast Michigan, where Ford employs approximately 46,000 people, the automaker is partnering with Beaumont Health for testing. Employees who exhibit symptoms of the virus — which as of Saturday had infected more than 50,500 people and killed 4,880 across the state — will receive a prescription for a test from an onsite doctor. The prescription will allow them to receive testing through Beaumont.

""Fast and accurate testing is a key tool in the effort to help stop the spread of COVID-19,"" Dr. Walter Talamonti, Ford's medical director, said in a statement. ""These contracts will allow us to test employees with suspected symptoms and have results back within 24 hours. If they test positive, we can quickly identify close contact employees who may have been exposed and ask them to self-quarantine for 14 days.”

In Louisville, tests will be conducted by University of Louisville Health. In the Kansas City area, employees will be tested at Liberty Hospital. And in the Chicago area, testing will be provided by the University of Chicago Medical Center and UChicago Medicine Ingalls Memorial Hospital.

Expanded testing is something for which the United Auto Workers has advocated. The union, which is part of a coronavirus task force with the Detroit Three, has said it is advocating for as much testing as possible right now and full testing when available.

All three Detroit automakers have said they will help employees get tested if they are experiencing symptoms or have been exposed to the virus. At the vast majority of its facilities across the country, GM will have onsite testing available to employees who are experiencing symptoms.

Ford's testing processes vary by area. In Louisville, symptomatic employees will first schedule a telemedicine appointment with a doctor. Employees in the Kansas City area can get a prescription on-site, then go to a drive-thru testing site. In Chicago, employees who need a test must call one of the health systems, then, if appropriate, will be given a same-day testing appointment.

Additionally, the company said it is looking into the possibility of offering voluntary antibody testing in the future.

Testing is one of numerous health and safety protocols Detroit automakers are putting in place as thousands of autoworkers start heading back to work in phases. Other measures include daily health self-certifications, temperature checks and providing personal protective equipment workers must wear.

Dead batteries prompted 40% of AAA’s calls for service in April, compared with 20% in April 2019, the organization’s Greater Hartford spokeswoman, Amy Parmenter, said.

“Some cars won’t last two weeks,” said Paul Hechenbleikner, manager of Jones’ Automotive Service in East Hartford.

Some vehicles draw more electrical power while parked with the engine off. Called “parasitic drain,” electrical current goes to engine computers and electronic control modules for power windows, mirrors and other accessories.

Also, older car batteries fizzle faster, said Don Cusson, owner of Cusson Automotive Inc. in South Windsor. Mechanics advise people to take a 20-minute cruise at least once a week to keep the battery charged.

Stationary autos also invite rodents seeking dry, warm places for nesting. The buck-toothed critters can cause costly horrors on wiring.

Connie Yan of Manchester said her car sat for about two weeks as she and her husband followed state guidelines and stayed home. One day last month, the couple decided to take a ride to ease cabin fever, but noticed warning lights for anti-lock braking and traction control systems.

Opening the hood revealed a retreating bushy tail and a huge nest next to the engine. Squirrels had chewed through wires, disabling some systems, and also had gnawed through a windshield washer spray hose, Yan said.

While removing the nest, the couple noticed something else — two baby squirrels that could hardly open their eyes. They placed the pair in a box on the ground with some of the nesting material so the mother could find them, she said.

After getting the car repaired, they sprayed diluted peppermint oil solution in a few spots to deter further visitors. People also use dryer sheets and mothballs to fend off squirrels, mice and chipmunks.

Hechenbleikner said he recently repaired squirrel damage on a car’s wiring harness. The bill was about $150, but that was cheap compared with the extensive damage he has seen in other vehicles.

Even as restrictions ease, many cars will not be rolling as they normally would for weeks or even months, so AAA advised owners to take the following steps:

If you won’t be driving your car at least once a week, a battery tender will maintain the charge.

Keep the gasoline tank at three-fourths or full. Full tanks help minimize condensation.

Check the tire pressure and fill, as needed, to the amount posted inside the driver’s door.

Despite virus-related repairs that some car owners need, Hechenbleikner and Cusson both said business is down and they have had to adjust their workforces.

“I try not to dwell on the figures,” Hechenbleikner said. “I don’t want to depress myself too much.”

Cusson said business at his 14-person shop has slowed 55%-60% and he had to cut technicians’ hours to 32 hours a week for four weeks. He did receive federal paycheck protection money and everyone is back to 40 hours a week, Cusson said, but the slowdown is still hurting.

But the shop also repairs motor homes, and Cusson said he feels confident that business will return as the pent-up longing to get back on the road is finally realized.

Nearly 40% of all part imports into the U.S. come from Mexico, meaning the success of any domestic industry restart will rest heavily on a successful simultaneous rev-up south of the border.

Mexico has reported far fewer coronavirus cases than U.S. and Canada, but experts have questioned the veracity of the nation's reporting. Mexican officials say the virus has caused 4,477 deaths in Mexico, compared to 87,965 in the U.S. and 5,553 in Canada.

Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced plans on Wednesday to begin a phased reopening in his country on May 18, coinciding with a scheduled restart of production at many U.S. auto plants. By Thursday, the López Obrador administration pushed the restart date of its auto sector back to June 1, adding confusion to a situation in which automakers are desperate for clarity after nearly two idle months.

Tony Payan, director of the Center for the United States and Mexico at Rice University's Baker Institute in Houston, said Mexico's restart could be premature whether it takes place on May 18 or June 1 because COVID-19 testing there has paled in comparison to the American pace, which has been criticized for being substandard by Trump administration critics.

""By almost any international standard, Mexico has really botched (and) completely mangled the management of this crisis,"" Payan said. ""They've chosen not to measure the problem. Mexico is at the bottom of the (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries at least in terms of rational record keeping of deaths. They just don't know.""

Payan said Mexico has conducted about one-half of one test per 1,000 people, compared to a U.S. rate of about 27 or 28 people per 1,000 residents.

""At this stage of the pandemic, there's no way to know the scope of the problem if you refuse to test,"" he said. ""The numbers in Mexico are based on people who have been hospitalized or have shown very serious symptoms. The multiplier could be many times more.""

In addition to the testing challenges, Payan said Mexico has experienced many of the problems that dogged the U.S. in the early days of its efforts to ramp up federal and state responses to the coronavirus.

""It's mainly the same issues other countries are facing,"" he said. ""No personal protection equipment — it's dismal. Health care systems are overwhelmed. Hospitals in Mexico City are full.""

The uncertainty presents a major problem for automakers as the U.S. industry attempts to rev up. Already, at least one company, Daimler AG, has suspended production of SUVs at one of the first U.S. plants to reopen in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, due to a shortage of Mexican parts.

""In the first week of the ramp-up, (Mercedes-Benz U.S. International) has begun limited production with a significantly reduced number of team members in 1 shift,"" the company said in a statement that was provided to The Detroit News. ""Due to respective country-specific regulations and their impact on international supplier sites, we expect temporary interruptions.""

Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at Ann Arbor's Center for Automotive Research, said the problems easily could be exacerbated if Mexico handles its coronavirus restart poorly.

""There are very few models that don't have some Mexican content,"" Dziczek said, noting that 39% of all part imports into the U.S. in 2019 came from Mexico. ""A synchronized restart with Mexico is really critical. You need all the parts to make a car.""

Dziczek said Mexico is a critical source for several important parts that are used to build cars in domestic plants, such as wiring harnesses used to connect critical electronic systems within vehicles.

""Eighty percent of wiring harnesses come through the Mexican border,"" she said. ""You can't build a car without the wires. It's not something that we make very many of domestically because it's very labor intensive.""

The López Obrador administration's restart plan calls for a color-coded alert system (red, orange, yellow, and green) similar to the one used previously by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for terror threats that will be used to notify Mexicans of the level of activities that are allowed in a given state at the time.

John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which lobbies for automakers in Washington, said in a statement the industry's' ""focus continues to be on the health and safety of our team members, customers and communities.

""With production facilities, supply chains and other vital operations located throughout the U.S. and North American region, we appreciate the ongoing support and engagement from the administration — as well as state, local and regional partners — as we move toward the safe resumption of operations,” he said.

Michelle Krebs, senior analyst for Autotrader, said the availability of Mexican parts is a major concern: ""Automakers are relying heavily on Mexico to build an adequate supply of parts so they can smoothly restart assembly plants and not have to stop and start again for lack of parts.""

But the cruisers will come anyway.

Michigan motorheads are already hitting the streets this May as a cure for months of cabin fever.

Woodward Avenue — nicknamed “The COVID 500” by local residents — has been busy as spring weather brought out everything from classic sedans to modified hot rods to modern muscle cars. The Michigan Car Cruise Calendar Facebook page is teeming with posts as members share car gatherings and personal car updates.

In Rochester Hills last Wednesday a group of enthusiasts organized the “Afternoon Cruise” which attracted some 100 cars for a leisurely mid-day drive up and down Hamlin Street. Well, mostly leisurely. Some participants couldn’t resist the occasional tire-squealing burnout.

“We thought is was a cool idea, so quite a few of our staff members participated,” explained Kim Zeile, founder of Trans-Am racing engine maker Prefix Corp., who helped organize the event. “The area is slowly beginning to open back up, and this was a safe and fun way to get some cool vehicles out and interact with fellow car enthusiasts.”

Enthusiasts gathered over a typical smorgasbord of dream rides — Porsche 911s, Jeeps, jacked-up pickups, Ford Focus pocket rockets, ol’ '50s jalopies — in the Prefix parking lot before cruising. Prefix provided a food truck for attendees to grab a quick lunch, and Mother Nature cooperated with a beautiful afternoon.

“It meant a little taste of feeling back to normal,” said participant Jhan Dolphin. “After all, not much can compare to the freedom of rolling down the windows and going for a drive in your favorite ride.”

Woodward Avenue is Michigan’s cruising main street and recent weekends have been busy. Growling street rods have been doing patented loops around the traditional, 16-mile parade route that runs from Ferndale to Pontiac. Others have gathered in Woodward parking lots — hoods propped open to display sparkling engines underneath — as owners swap stories and urge on passing classics.

The activity starts a slow build to the official, 26th annual Dream Cruise on Saturday, Aug. 15 this year. The cruise reportedly attracts up to 1.5 million people.

Those numbers may be down this year as enthusiasts — especially older demographics — weigh the risks of COVID-19 and as authorities pressure organizers to social distance. Organizers have declined comment to date, citing the virus situation as too fluid to make plans three months out from the Cruise.

An announcement is expected in early June. Insiders say there will be changes, with participants urged to stay in their cars while communities cancel most official events.

Woodward Dream Cruise Parking, which helps cruisers find spots on the crowded route, posted on its Facebook page this week that the “Woodward Dream Cruise is going to happen this year ... however, you will see big changes. Most of the organized community events will be canceled, including entertainment, concerts, car shows, vendors, Emergency Vehicle show, kid zone, etc., to keep large crowd gatherings to a minimum.”

The Dream Cruise has always been controversial among some local residents who object to the noise and odors that the rolling traffic jam brings each summer. With added concerns over COVID-19, nerves are more on edge this year.

Paul Canvasser, a resident of Poppleton Park in Birmingham, recently wrote on Next Door that “I am fed up with the noise and racing that has overtaken Woodward. It is even more annoying since I have been isolated at home for several weeks. Everything else is shut down, but the cruising is the first thing to come back. It is time to alter this situation!”

The post received 310 community responses.

More gatherings are scheduled this weekend from Rochester to Woodward as the weather warms to 70 degrees. But critics may get their wish for a respite from the COVID 500 on Sunday. The chance of rain is 100 percent.

When astronauts from NASA were first isolated in space, from 1961 to 1963 in Project Mercury, they were away from Earth on flights lasting from Alan Shepard Jr.’s 15 minutes to L. Gordon Cooper Jr.’s 34 hours.

But as the country reached for the moon, Project Gemini began requiring a far more burdensome, considerably extended period of social isolation, at a considerable physical distance.

Doctors and scientists say the efforts more than half a century ago may provide lessons for living through today's pandemic, when the major remedy is staying home to stay safe.

“In Gemini, you have guys in pairs being sent out for weeks at a time. And it was stressful,” said Deana Weibel, a professor of anthropology, at Grand Valley State University, whose research focus includes space exploration.

“One of the descriptions was that they were in a space about the size of the front seat of a VW Bug,” Weibel said.

“Very limited space, small couches, and you’re stuck like that for two weeks.

“So trying to get along with another person for that amount of time is probably better than being completely by yourself. But it is certainly something where by the time they landed, they were ready to get away from each other!” she said.

Weibel recently wrote a piece for The Space Review, a 17-year-old online publication, about social isolation in space. Among her conclusions: Even though a lot goes on in space, diversions are crucial for tolerating social isolation.

Schedules create structure, provide mental stimulation and break up the day.

And communication with others outside the bubble is a godsend. Whether it is the folks at Mission Control, the president of the United States or members of the family, who could sometimes pipe in. Especially during the flights later, in Project Apollo, hearing from others outside of the bubble helped astronauts maintain proper frames of mind.

“Al Worden, who is from Michigan, and who died just March 18, has the Guinness Book of World Records record for being the most isolated human being that’s ever existed,” Weibel said.

Worden, an astronaut and engineer born in Jackson who attended the University of Michigan, spent three days alone in the command module during the Apollo 15 mission in 1971, becoming the most socially distanced person, in history.

“When he was orbiting the moon, and David Scott and Jim Irving were on the surface of the moon, (he was) farther than anyone on Earth could possibly be from any other human on Earth,” she explained.

“And when he talks about it in his memoir, he dealt with it mostly just by staying really, really busy. They had an extremely rigid schedule that he was supposed to follow.

“He actually enjoyed the isolation, a bit, after being involved with the other guys for a while,” Weibel said.

A.W. “Tony” England, dean of the College of Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Michigan-Dearborn, is a former astronaut who served as mission scientist for Apollo 13 and 16 and space station program scientist from 1986 to 1987.

England said NASA draws on the history of exploration, which often involved extreme physical distancing and social isolation.

“What NASA did for the early scientist astronauts, seven us of which eventually flew in something, the way they approached us is that they had found in the military that establishing common experiences and understanding how teams have to work under pressure convinced them that the thing to do for us was to give us the same experiences,” he said.

“A submarine crew is out for months without contact outside of the submarine. In the old sailing ships, the whalers were gone for years, mostly at sea,” he said. “So there is a long history of people working in a strange environment, without access to family or access to normal recreation.”

While he had an eight-day space flight, England said, he also was in Antarctica with field teams, twice, for two-and-a-half months and only shortwave radio communication, “without seeing so much as a contrail.”

Unlike the coronavirus, which appeared suddenly and relentlessly for many people, without seeking volunteers, exploration — and the accompanying isolation — is often the fondest desire of those exploring.

Unlike COVID-19, astronauts and other explorers want to be where they are, and have trained.

“I guess my experience would say that people who would accept the challenge as something they really want to invest themselves in, really don’t have that much of a problem in extended living situations where it’s not normal life,” England said, of his varied experiences.

“The other thing that is really important in a situation like that is an understanding and an acceptance of your responsibilities,” he said.

Being isolated in close quarters with a unit of people places a premium on everyone knowing their roles and fulfilling them, in a spirit of teamwork.

“It was interesting. On our flight, the commander, Gordie Fullerton had been a test pilot of heavy airplanes, and so he was used to working with large crews,” England said. “It made it a delightful experience for us.

“Some of the commanders, who were from fighters or single-pilot airplanes, didn’t adjust to the idea of working with a crew. And their crews have come back down, you know, not really close friends.”

The astronauts' experiences, and the information culled from them, are of significant interest to doctors, especially at the Space Medicine Innovations Laboratory at the Geisel School of Medicine, at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire.

In the lab, doctors and scientist research behavioral approaches for people in confined spaces, to devise strategies for handling stress, depression and conflict that can come from confinement, not unlike those associated with a pandemic.

Especially pertinent in the time of coronavirus, the Dartmouth PATH Program provides a series of self-help tools designed for astronauts coping with confinement in small spaces for extended periods.

“Our work is focused on providing people with self-directed, anonymous tools that they can use, in the moment, to help them with these kinds of things,” said Dr. Jay Buckey, a professor of medicine at Dartmouth, director of the Space Medicine Innovations Lab, and a former astronaut.

“So they’re online. It’s at path.dartmouth.edu, and it’s a research project, so you have to sign a consent form.”

Mobile devices are not currently supported.

The program highlights coping with stress, depression and conflict in isolation and confinement.

“These are self-help tools,” said Buckey, a former astronaut. “The individual is doing the work. The tools offer practical things that people can do in any environment.”

Buckey flew aboard the space shuttle Columbia in 1998. He and research colleagues at Dartmouth, Harvard and UCLA developed the tools over more than decade.

“In the conflict area, it gives you some different ways to think about conflict,” he explained.

“Why is when you say something, people responded in a totally different way than you expected? You think you’re saying something really innocuous, and it gets a big response. It helps you understand, sometimes, what is going on there,” Buckey said.

“It also gives you some tips on being a good negotiator that keeps the relationship in mind. For a lot of us, now, being in isolation, where we're close to family and friends and roommates, people who we probably want to maintain or relationships with. But, we still got to negotiate things; we’re going to have some disagreements.

“So the inter-space negotiation is kind of a skill on how to do that better,” he said.

Glen Swanson, a former chief historian at the Johnson Space Center in Houston and a former physics instructor at Grand Valley State University, said the significant difference between space exploration and life in a time of pandemic is that NASA missions come with an end date.

“The crew members, they have a flight plan,” said Swanson, Weibel’s husband. “There is great comfort in knowing when this is going to be over.

“I know when I’m going to come back, I’m going to see my family and friends. I am prepared for this three-month, six-month stay, or whatever the duration, ahead of time.

“When I signed up for this gig in advance, I knew what was going to happen.”

COVID-19 is a different gig, Swanson said.

“The big difference here is we just don’t have that. We don’t have that splashdown. We don’t know when things are going to come to an end, and there’s a lot of uncertainty.

“And uncertainty is something that NASA tries to avoid.""

The novel coronavirus comes from a group of viruses that originate or spread in bats, and it’s still unclear what animal may have transmitted the disease to humans, Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO expert in animal diseases that jump to humans, said Friday in a briefing with reporters.

The virus probably arrived in humans through contact with animals raised to supply food, though scientists have yet to determine which species, he said. Studies have shown that cats and ferrets are susceptible to COVID-19, and dogs to a lesser extent, he said, without specifying whether they can transmit the disease to people. It’s important to find out which animals can get infected to avoid creating a “reservoir” in another species, he said.

Questions about the origin of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that has caused the pandemic, have intensified since U.S. President Donald Trump suggested it came from a laboratory in China. Germany most recently questioned the claim, made by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Der Spiegel reported. Intelligence services from five countries, including the U.S., were unable to confirm his statements, it said. Scientists who have studied the issue maintain that the virus originated in an animal, and probably entered the human population in November.

New mission

WHO scientists are considering a new mission to China to get more information about the virus’s animal origin, Maria van Kerkhove, one of the agency’s top epidemiologists, said at a press briefing Wednesday. Questions remain about whether the virus traveled directly from bats to people, or if other species were involved.

Pangolins, armored mammals that live in Asia, have been found to harbor versions of Sars-CoV-2 that are similar to those in people. The WHO wanted to conduct more animal investigations on an earlier mission to China, but the lockdown of the outbreak’s epicenter in Wuhan made that impractical, Ben Embarek has said.

The first human cases were detected in and around Wuhan, and most of those people had contact with the animal market, though not all, Ben Embarek said.

Trump has doubled down on claims that the Chinese mistakenly released the virus from the laboratory as the outbreak in the U.S. has grown to become the world’s largest and deadliest. Chinese officials have said that the U.S. has no evidence to back up those claims and called the allegations a blame game.
