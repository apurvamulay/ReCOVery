LONDON — A series of studies of the genomes of thousands of samples of the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 show that it is mutating and evolving as it adapts to its human hosts.
Here's what experts are saying about those findings and how they might affect the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to develop vaccines and treatments.
WHAT HAVE THE STUDIES FOUND?* Using a database called the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID), researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in the United States tracked genetic changes, or mutations, in the ""spike"" of the new coronavirus - the part that gives it its distinctive shape.
Their preliminary research found 14 such mutations. The researchers said one, called D614G, was ""of urgent concern"" because it appeared to be emerging as dominant and may make the disease more infectious.
* Using the same GISAID database, a team at University College London in Britain screened the genomes of more than 7,500 viruses from infected patients around the world.
The UCL team found 198 mutations in the coronavirus genomes they analysed but said none appear at this stage to be particularly worrying.
* Another study by scientists at Britain's Glasgow University, which also analysed mutations in the genomes of SARS-CoV-2 virus samples, found that these changes did not signal that there are different strains.
That contradicted a previous preliminary study by Chinese researchers that suggested there had been two strains circulating in people at the start of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, and that one had been more ""aggressive"".
WHAT DO THOSE FINDINGS TELL US?""This multiple strains idea has to be very much debunked,"" said Eric Topol, a cardiologist, geneticist and founder of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in La Jolla, California.
""We know there is only one strain.""Jonathan Stoye, head of the division of virology at Britain's Francis Crick Institute, said that taken together, the studies offer ""fascinating"" insights in the evolution of the virus, and emphasise that it is ""a moving target"".
""The virus is evolving and is changing. And we don't yet know what the consequences of those changes are,"" Stoye said.
""This coronavirus mutates just like any good RNA virus should,"" said Mark Schleiss, a molecular genetics expert at the University of Minnesota Medical School. 
IS SARS-CoV-2 GETTING MORE DANGEROUS?Genetics and biology experts say it's still too early to know whether any of the mutations are meaningful. 
Lawrence Young, a professor of molecular oncology at Britain's University of Warwick, said that while there is ""much speculation about the possible emergence of more aggressive strains"", studies so far show that is not the case.
""Overall the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not mutate at a high rate... and there is currently no compelling evidence that the mutations have had a significant effect,"" he said
Topol said scientists will have to conduct studies in functional genomics - examining precisely how a specific genetic mutation affects the behaviour of a virus - to find out more. 
WILL THIS AFFECT THE SEARCH FOR VACCINES AND DRUGS?The mutations found by the UCL were not evenly distributed across the virus genome, with some parts of the genome less likely to mutate, and others more likely to vary. 
Lucy van Dorp, who co-led the UCL work, said those more stable parts of the virus could be better targets for drug and vaccine development. ""We want to target the parts of the virus that, as far as we have observed, aren't changing. If they haven't changed much in the course of the pandemic so far, hopefully they won't change much in the future.""

(Reuters) - Health policy experts say the United States must dramatically increase the availability of tests for the coronavirus if it is to safely reopen its economy. 
U.S. regulators have moved speedily to authorize many new tests, but concerns still remain about tests’ accuracy, and some policymakers say new testing technologies need to proliferate to fully contain the virus. 
MOLECULAR DIAGNOSTIC TESTSMolecular diagnostic tests show who has contracted the virus. Most rely on samples collected from patients using nasal swabs. The samples are then analyzed using a method called polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which detects viral RNA. These tests can be highly accurate, in some instances detecting the virus in 95% of cases. 
The first diagnostic tests to get U.S. regulatory approval required that a sample be shipped back to a laboratory to be analyzed, slowing the speed at which patients could receive results. More recently approved diagnostic tests can be conducted at the same location where the sample is taken and provide results in minutes.
Examples:    - Roche cobas SARS-CoV-2Authorized for use by U.S. regulators in March, Roche's website says it is currently shipping around 8 million tests per month. It requires a sample taken by nasal swab be sent back to a lab for analysis. Roche says studies show it can detect very low levels of the virus with 95% accuracy. - Abbott ID Now
Approved in late March, Abbott’s rapid, point-of-care molecular diagnostic test can provide results on site to patients within minutes. As of May 4, Abbott said it is producing 50,000 of these tests per day, and plans to ramp up to 2 million by June. A study conducted by the Cleveland Clinic showed the test detected the virus in around 85% of cases.
ANTIGEN TESTSEarlier this month, U.S. regulators authorized the first antigen test, a new category of diagnostic test. This type of test scans for proteins that can be found on or inside of a virus. They test samples taken from the nasal cavity using swabs. Antigen tests can detect the virus very quickly and can potentially be produced at lower cost.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration says antigen test production can potentially scale to millions per day. But they produce false negatives at a higher rate than molecular diagnostics tests.
Examples:- Quidel Corporation Sofia 2 SARS Antigen FIAAuthorized for use earlier this month, Quidel said the test picks up around 80% of COVID-19 cases.
ANTIBODY TESTSAntibody tests take small samples of patients’ blood and scan them for antibodies, which the immune system produces in response to a virus. They can be conducted in labs or through on-site tests that provide results in minutes.
Antibody tests, also known as serological tests, are not as effective as molecular diagnostic tests in catching COVID-19 at early-stages, when patients may not yet be producing antibodies. But they can confirm if patients previously had the virus and have antibodies that might protect them against future infection. 
The FDA recently tightened rules on serological test developers after a proliferation of unauthorized tests raised questions about their reliability. Researchers have not confirmed whether recovered patients who are producing antibodies are fully immune to COVID-19. 
    Examples:- Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG AssayResearchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine say the test, which Abbott launched in April, has a specificity of 99.9% and a sensitivity of 100%, suggesting very few false positives and no false negatives. Abbott has already shipped more than 10 million antibody tests to hospitals and labs.

NEW YORK — The following is a brief roundup of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.
New coronavirus antibody test highly accurateA new antibody test is highly accurate at determining whether people have been infected with the novel coronavirus, according to a study published on Friday in The Journal of Clinical Microbiology. Researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine found the test, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, had a specificity rate of 99.9% and a sensitivity rate of 100%, suggesting little chance of incorrectly diagnosing a healthy person as having been infected and virtually no chance of a false negative readout. Abbott's test has received emergency use authorization from the FDA and the company has already shipped more than 10 million of the tests to hospitals and labs. (Links: https://reut.rs/2xIdOdk https://bit.ly/2Lb24U3)
Coronavirus antibodies in breast milk may protect infantsBreast milk from infected mothers may contain antibodies to the novel coronavirus that could be protective for babies, a study suggests. ""Nursing mothers who are infected with the novel coronavirus should continue to breastfeed throughout their COVID-19 illness and beyond, because (other researchers) have shown transmission does not occur via milk, and we have determined that antibodies are almost certainly there, and may protect their babies from infection,"" Rebecca Powell of The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, who led the study, told Reuters. Her team's report, posted on Friday on the preprint server medRxiv, has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. (https://bit.ly/2WHvJcA)
Hydroxychloroquine fails to show benefit in hospitalized coronavirus patientsIn a large observational study of hospitalized coronavirus patients, hydroxychloroquine - an old malaria drug championed by U.S. President Donald Trump as a ""game changer"" in the fight against the virus - neither lessened patients' need for breathing assistance nor their risk of death, according to a report published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine. 
""We didn't see any association between getting this medicine and the chance of dying or being intubated,"" lead researcher Dr. Neil Schluger, of New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center, told Reuters. ""The patients who got the drug didn't seem to do any better."" Patients in the study were not randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine or a placebo, the researchers noted, and so randomized trials, the gold standard for tests of new therapies, should continue.

Life-threatening syndrome develops in some children after coronavirus exposureA rare, life-threatening condition is developing in some children after exposure to the new coronavirus that researchers are calling ""Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Potentially Associated with COVID-19."" Doctors are seeing clusters of children, some very young, with the disorder, which can attack multiple organs, impair heart function and weaken heart arteries. British physicians reporting on Thursday in The Lancet said the children initially have fever, rash, conjunctivitis, lower-limb swelling, pain in arms and legs, and ""significant"" gastrointestinal symptoms, even without testing positive for the coronavirus. The syndrome, while rare, can rapidly progress to critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation. (Links: https://reut.rs/3cj848U https://bit.ly/3cea3LK https://bit.ly/3cea3LK) )
Coronavirus may survive in spermChinese researchers who tested the sperm of 38 men infected with COVID-19 found that six of them, or 16%, had the new coronavirus in their semen, suggesting a small chance that the virus, formally known as SARS-CoV-2, could be sexually transmitted, scientists said. Some of the men were already recovering from their illness.
""If it could be proved that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted sexually ... (that) might be a critical part of the prevention,"" doctors at China's Shangqiu Municipal Hospital wrote in the medical journal JAMA Network Open on Thursday, adding that more research is needed. (Links: https://reut.rs/2WhI2h0 https://bit.ly/3bm6JgA )
Poor nasal swab technique may explain some false negative coronavirus testsPart of the reason for some false negative coronavirus tests - tests that do not detect the virus in someone who is actually infected - may be that the test sample was not collected properly by the person using the nasopharyngeal swab, Canadian researchers say. They reanalyzed specimens from patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 whose test results had been negative or unclear and found less human DNA than they expected to see. Correct use of nasopharyngeal swabs to obtain a high quality specimen ""requires training and expertise as it involves insertion of the swab to ... a depth of roughly 7 centimeters (2.76 inches), followed by rotation and withdrawal,"" Zabrina Brumme of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia and colleagues say. Their study, posted on Friday on the preprint server medRxiv, has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. ( https://bit.ly/2yGKG6J )
Coronavirus spread affected more by public health measures than by climateTemperature and latitude do not appear to be associated with the spread of the novel coronavirus, and humidity levels have only a weak effect, according to data collected in March from 144 regions of the world. By contrast, public health measures like social distancing, school closures and sheltering at home do make a difference and were strongly associated with reduced epidemic growth, Dr. Peter Juni at the University of Toronto and colleagues found in a report published on Friday in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).
""The important effect of public health interventions needs to be weighed carefully against potential economic and psychosocial harms when deciding when and how to lift restrictions,"" Juni's team concluded in their report. ( https://bit.ly/2YIVmfS )

4,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/health/coronavirus-remdesivir.html,The New York Times,2020-05-01,['Gina Kolata'],"How Remdesivir, New Hope for Covid-19 Patients, Was Resurrected",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/01/science/01VIRUS-REMDESIVIR2/01VIRUS-REMDESIVIR2-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
Remdesivir, an antiviral drug designed to treat both hepatitis and a common respiratory virus, seemed fated to join thousands of other failed medications after proving useless against those diseases. The drug was consigned to the pharmaceutical scrap heap, all but forgotten by the scientists who once championed it.
But on Friday, the Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency approval for remdesivir as a treatment for patients severely ill with Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The story of remdesivir’s rescue and transformation testifies to the powerful role played by federal funding, which allowed scientists laboring in obscurity to pursue basic research without obvious financial benefits. This research depends almost entirely on government grants.
Dr. Mark Denison of Vanderbilt University is one of a handful of researchers who discovered remdesivir’s potential. He began studying coronaviruses a quarter-century ago, a time when few scientists cared about them — the ones infecting humans caused colds, he recalled, and scientists just wanted to know how they worked.
“We were interested from the biologic perspective,” Dr. Denison recalled. “No one was interested from a therapeutic perspective.”
Neither he nor the scores of other scientists interested in coronaviruses foresaw that a new one would unleash a plague that has killed nearly a quarter-million people worldwide. The F.D.A. rushed to approve remdesivir under emergency use provisions, after a federal trial demonstrated modest improvements in severely ill patients.
The trial, sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, included more than 1,000 hospitalized patients and found that those receiving remdesivir recovered faster than those who got a placebo: in 11 days, versus 15 days. 
But the drug did not significantly reduce fatality rates, and some critics noted that the trial’s primary endpoint — its measure of success — had been greatly simplified to emphasize time to recovery. 
A half-dozen experts contacted by The Times on Thursday said the change was necessary. Officials at N.I.A.I.D. said biostatisticians urging the revision had not seen the data and were not aiming for a particular result.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the institute, said the results were “a very important proof of concept” but not a “knockout.” President Trump hailed the drug on Friday as “an important treatment” and “really promising.”
Remdesivir is approved only for severely ill patients and only temporarily; formal approval must come later. Still, some doctors laboring in intensive care units embraced the drug as an important new weapon against a virus that is killing patients worldwide.
“It’s a great first step,” said Dr. Robert Finberg, chairman of the department of medicine at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
Little about the early history of remdesivir, manufactured by Gilead Sciences, suggested the hopes now placed upon it.
Coronaviruses hold much more RNA than scientists once theorized a virus could. Many viruses that cause epidemics rely on this type of genetic material, and almost all mutate constantly. That is why flu viruses change from year to year.
Yet coronaviruses did not change much — their mutation rate is about one-twentieth the rate of other RNA viruses.
In 2007, Dr. Denison discovered that coronaviruses have a powerful “proofreading” system. If an error occurs in copying RNA as the coronavirus replicates, it corrects the error. In lab experiments, coronaviruses that mutated were weaker, outcompeted by those without mutations.
Dr. Denison and other experts wondered if it might be possible to trick the virus with a drug that dodged the proofreading system and blocked the virus’s growing RNA chain, making it prematurely terminate.
Talking about this problem with another scientist at a meeting, Dr. Denison learned that Gilead Sciences had dozens of drugs that might do the trick. “All of these compounds had been shelved for one reason or another,” Dr. Denison said.
Most worked in lab tests to shut down coronaviruses, he found — some better than others. One of the best was GS-5734, now known as remdesivir. “I like to call it the Terminator,” Dr. Denison said.
Dr. Denison discovered remdesivir was just what they were seeking: a drug that slipped past the viruses’ powerful system to protect RNA, their genetic material. Remdesivir made growing chains of the viral RNA terminate prematurely, killing the virus.
Remdesivir killed every known coronavirus in Dr. Denison’s tests. Then researchers at the University of North Carolina found that the drug also killed the viruses in infected animals.
That included not just coronaviruses that cause the common cold, but also SARS and MERS — even a coronavirus that infects only mice.
But the drug failed a number of real-life tests, not just against hepatitis but also against Ebola in Africa. The drug languished, unapproved for any use — until a new coronavirus emerged.
As SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, began to grow into a pandemic, many scientists realized that remdesivir might be the best solution at hand. It had already undergone animal testing and safety testing in humans.
So doctors began giving it to patients in studies without controls and even outside of studies altogether. Anecdotes fueled demand. Gilead sponsored some of these studies and gave the drug to doctors who treated hundreds of patients under compassionate use, a legal exemption permitting use of an unapproved drug to treat patients.
But none of this could demonstrate that a drug was helpful to patients. It took the federal trial, in which many patients were given a placebo, to show that remdesivir seems to have a modest effect.
Even a modest effect from the drug in hospitalized patients was a surprise, said Dr. Arnold Monto, an epidemiologist at the University of Michigan. He had expected that patients like those in the federal trial would not respond.
They were severely ill, and such patients often suffer not from their viral infections but from overreactions of the immune system. (That is why Tamiflu does not work well in severely ill flu patients, he added.)
“Thank God, we have something that works,” Dr. Monto said.Not everyone is convinced that remdesivir will live up to its promise. A study in China, published this week in Lancet, found the drug offered no benefit to severely ill patients. And many experts want to see the data from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases trial; so far, there have been only announcements about the results from administration officials.
Despite these questions, Gilead has been ramping up production and currently has 1.5 million vials on hand, enough for about 150,000 patients. Those will be provided to patients at no cost, said Daniel O’Day, the company’s chief executive.
He would not discuss what Gilead might charge in the long run, following a formal approval, but remdesivir is unlikely to be cheap, despite its origins in federally funded research.
“Gilead discovered this medicine and developed this medicine,” Mr. O’Day said. “We have been involved all the way.”
Some experts fear that taxpayers won’t get their due.“Their pricing should reflect that the government not only invested substantial funds, but at risky stages,” said Dr. Aaron Kesselheim, a professor of medicine at Harvard University who studies drug pricing.
If Gilead reaps all the rewards, he added, “that doesn’t seem fair.”"
5,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/health/coronavirus-cardiac-heart-attacks.html,The New York Times,2020-03-27,['Gina Kolata'],"A Heart Attack? No, It Was the Coronavirus",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/27/science/27VIRUS-HEART1a/27VIRUS-HEART1a-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
The 64-year-old patient arrived at a hospital in Brooklyn with symptoms looking like those seen in patients having a serious heart attack.
An electrocardiogram revealed an ominous heart rhythm. The patient had high blood levels of a protein called troponin, a sign of damaged heart muscle. Doctors rushed to open the patient’s blocked arteries — but found that no arteries were blocked.
The patient was not having a heart attack. The culprit was the coronavirus.The Brooklyn patient recovered after 12 days in the hospital and is now at home. But there have been reports of similar patients in the United States and abroad, and the cases have raised troubling questions for doctors.
What should doctors do these days when they see patients with apparent heart attacks? Should they first rule out coronavirus infection — or is that a waste of valuable time for the majority of patients who are actually having heart attacks?
Should every coronavirus patient be tested for high blood levels of troponin to see if the virus has attacked the heart?
“I don’t know what the right answer is,” said Dr. Nir Uriel, a cardiologist at Columbia University and Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.
The Brooklyn patient had myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart that has been seen in patients with other viral infections, such as MERS — also caused by a coronavirus — and the H1N1 swine flu.
But the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, mostly infects the lungs, causing pneumonia in severe cases. Believing it caused respiratory disease, many cardiologists thought the coronavirus was outside their specialty.
“We were thinking lungs, lungs, lungs — with us in a supportive role,” said Dr. John Rumsfeld, chief science and quality officer at the American College of Cardiology. “Then all of a sudden we began to hear about potential direct impact on the heart.”
A report on heart problems among coronavirus patients in Wuhan, China, was published in JAMA Cardiology on Friday.
The study, led by Dr. Zhibing Lu at Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, found that 20 percent of patients hospitalized with Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, had some evidence of heart damage.
Many were not known to have underlying heart disease. But they often had abnormal electrocardiograms, like the patient in Brooklyn, in addition to elevated troponin levels, which sometimes soared to levels seen in patients with heart attacks.
The risk of death was more than four times higher among these patients, compared with patients without heart complications.
The journal also published a report, by doctors in Italy, describing a previously healthy 53-year-old woman who developed myocarditis.
Like the patient in Brooklyn, her electrocardiogram was abnormal, and she had high levels of troponin in her blood. Because of the coronavirus outbreak in Italy, doctors thought to test her and found she was infected.
Dr. Enrico Ammirati, an expert in myocarditis at Niguarda Hospital in Milan who consulted on the case, said the patient’s heart problems were likely caused by her body’s immune response to the virus.
But so much about this new pathogen is unknown, and it is not yet clear what might cause heart damage following infection.
“Myocarditis can likely be caused either by the virus itself, or the body’s immune and inflammatory response to the virus,” said Dr. Scott Solomon, a cardiologist at Harvard Medical School.
Infected patients who get myocarditis do not necessarily have any more virus in their bodies than those who do not develop the condition, he said.
It is possible — but not yet established — that myocarditis results from an immune system that lurches out of control while trying to turn back the coronavirus, pumping out such excessive levels of chemicals called cytokines that cause inflammation that they damage the lungs and the heart alike.
The condition, called a cytokine storm, is more serious in older people and in people with underlying chronic diseases, Dr. Solomon said. It is the primary reason for the severe respiratory complications that can lead to death in patients with the coronavirus.
Cytokines also promote blood coagulation and interfere with the body’s clot-busting system, said Dr. Peter Libby, a cardiologist at Harvard Medical School. Blood clots in coronary arteries can block blood flow and cause heart attacks.
Another possibility, Dr. Libby said, is that some coronavirus patients develop heart problems as a consequence of infections in their lungs.
“The lungs are not working, so there is not enough oxygen,” he said. “That increases the risk for arrhythmias.”
At the same time, fever caused by the virus increases the body’s metabolism and the heart’s output of blood. The result is that the patient’s heart must struggle with an increased demand for oxygen but a reduced supply, an imbalance that may lead to heart damage.
But doctors cannot rule out the possibility that the coronavirus directly damages the heart, several experts said.
In Seattle, a patient infected with the virus recently died after experiencing so-called heart block: The electrical signals originating in the top of the organ, which sets the heart’s normal rhythm, were not reaching the bottom of the heart.
When that happens, the heart goes into an emergency mode with so-called escape rhythm, which causes it to beat very slowly. The man had underlying lung disease, which worsened his prognosis.
Dr. April S. Stempien-Otero, a cardiologist at the University of Washington, hopes an autopsy will show whether the virus attacked the man’s heart.
“We thought it was older-person heart block,” she said. “Then all of a sudden Covid raises its head.”
From now on, she said, “we have to think, maybe that is what is going on.”"

(Reuters) - The following is a brief roundup of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.
Normal speech sprays droplets with contagious coronavirus The thousands of tiny fluid droplets that we spray during normal conversation are a potentially significant way the new coronavirus spreads from person to person, according to a report on Wednesday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA. Using laser light scattering, researchers studied the small droplets that linger in the air after exiting the mouth. Based on earlier research into levels of the virus in oral fluid, they estimate that one minute of loud speaking could generate more than 1,000 virus-containing droplets that would remain airborne for at least eight minutes. ""There is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments,"" Philip Anfinrud and Adriaan Bax of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland and their coauthors conclude. (https://bit.ly/3fJIRqp)
Twin antibodies may be better than one Scientists have found twin antibodies that neutralize the new coronavirus, each by slightly different mechanisms. Finding a way to use both antibodies simultaneously might be a particularly good way to attack the virus, the researchers say. According to their report on Wednesday in Science, the two antibodies were isolated from a patient who recovered from COVID-19. Both work by attaching to a spike on the virus that helps it break into human cells. Because the antibodies each bind to different places on the spike, a ""cocktail"" containing both may be more effective than a treatment using either one by itself. The information could also help in development of a preventive vaccine, the laboratory experiments suggest. Furthermore, even if the virus mutates so that one of the antibodies no longer works, the other might still retain its neutralizing activity. (https://bit.ly/2WsbD7b)
Children with cancer may be no more vulnerable to the coronavirus than healthy kidsChildren with cancer do not need to delay treatment for fear of becoming more vulnerable to the new coronavirus, according to a study reported on Wednesday in JAMA Oncology. ""It was reassuring that they didn't appear to be any more vulnerable than other children,"" Dr. Andrew Kung, coauthor of the study and head of pediatrics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, told Reuters. ""With this information we can now feel confident to forge ahead with cancer therapy and not delay out of fears of affecting susceptibility to COVID-19."" 
Among children with cancer but without symptoms of coronavirus infection, only 2.5% tested positive for the virus, researchers reported. Among those who had been exposed to the virus or had symptoms suggestive of infection, 29.3% tested positive, with only one requiring hospitalization. Altogether, the team tested 178 children and 74 adult caregivers for the virus. Among the children's asymptomatic caregivers, 14.7% turned out to be infected. ""Even in that setting, we found that just half of the time when a caregiver was positive did the kid also test positive,"" Kung said. ""This suggests that there is something about kids that makes them less susceptible not just to the development of symptoms but to the infection itself.""
(https://bit.ly/3cuDM3j)Scientists find cheaper way to study coronavirus genomeResearchers have found a simpler, cheaper way to sequence the coronavirus genome, a crucial process that allows researchers access the genetic information in the RNA of the virus. ""This approach builds on ongoing sequencing efforts by other groups but bypasses time consuming and costly steps in preparing samples for sequencing,"" Daryl Gohl of the University of Minnesota Genomics Center, who led the research, told Reuters. ""The ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at low cost and at large scale will aid in the genomic surveillance of (the virus) for public health efforts, and has the potential to accelerate studies on the influence of viral genetics on transmissibility, virulence, and clinical outcomes."" The paper describing the new method was posted online on Tuesday on the bioRxiv website but has not yet been peer-reviewed. (https://bit.ly/3buhU6A)
Coronavirus particles in feces may not be infectiousThe new coronavirus may not spread via contact with fecal matter, researchers suggest in a report on Wednesday in Science Immunology. In laboratory experiments, they discovered that while the virus does infect the cells of the small intestine, fluid from the large intestine inactivates it, so that the virus is no longer infectious by the time it is excreted in feces. The authors caution, however, that because they only studied fecal samples from 10 patients, they cannot definitively rule out fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Their findings also suggest that certain protein-digesting enzymes help the new coronavirus enter cells in the gut. Blocking those two enzymes might be a way to treat the infection, they speculate, especially since a drug that inhibits the TMPRSS2 enzyme is already approved in Japan to treat pancreatitis.

You had some exposures that may put you at risk for coronavirus. A few days later you come down with a bad cough yourself and feel a little short of breath and really tired. You take your temperature: 101 degrees. A fever.
You suspect you might have Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The days roll into each other, and your doctor urges you to stay home unless your condition worsens. You feel pretty bad, though, and finally get an appointment.
They test you for influenza by sticking a swab far up your nose, and you are told the test came back negative, you don’t have flu. They tell you they are saving the Covid-19 tests for those who are even worse off than you are. You go home with a prescription for antibiotics, possibly because they don’t know what else to do, and read about celebrities who are testing positive but don’t seem so sick.

They tell you that the results will be available in a couple of days and you go home and wait. Finally, the results come back and you are told you do not have Covid-19. Now what?
This is a real patient’s story. In fact, it is a lot of people’s story — at least some version of it. Across the world, people with signs and symptoms of Covid-19 are testing negative and wondering what it means. They are not showing up in the statistics, and they are left in limbo about what to do next.
The problem may be with the test. Current coronavirus tests may have a particularly high rate of missing infections. The good news is that the tests appear to be highly specific: If your test comes back positive, it is almost certain you have the infection.
The most common test to detect the coronavirus involves a process known as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, or RT-PCR, a jumble of words that describes a method capable of detecting virus particles that are generally present in respiratory secretions during the beginning of an infection. From a technical standpoint, under ideal conditions, these tests can detect small amounts of viral RNA.
In the real world, though, the experience can be quite different, and the virus can be missed. The best the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention can say is that if you test negative, “you probably were not infected at the time your specimen was collected.” The key word there is “probably.”
False-negative test results — tests that indicate you are not infected, when you are — seem to be uncomfortably common. Increasingly, and disturbingly, I hear a growing number of anecdotal stories from my fellow doctors of patients testing negative for coronavirus and then testing positive — or people who are almost certainly infected who are testing negative.
Unfortunately, we have very little public data on the false-negative rate for these tests in clinical practice. Research coming out of China indicates that the false-negative rate may be around 30 percent. Some of my colleagues, experts in laboratory medicine, express concerns the false-negative rate in this country could be even higher.
There are many reasons a test would be falsely negative under real-life conditions. Perhaps the sampling is inadequate. A common technique requires the collection of nasal secretions far back in the nose — and then rotating the swab several times. That is not an easy procedure to perform or for patients to tolerate. Other possible causes of false negative results are related to laboratory techniques and the substances used in the tests.
So, where does that leave us? Even with more testing, we are likely to be underestimating the spread of the virus. For now, we should assume that anyone could be carrying the virus. If you have had likely exposures and symptoms suggest Covid-19 infection, you probably have it — even if your test is negative. We should all continue to practice the behaviors — rigorous hand washing, not touching the face, social distancing — that impede its spread. And we need better information about the performance of these tests — including any new tests that are introduced — in the real world.
Even as better tests emerge, we should always put the test result in the context of the other information we have. It’s a lesson that endures throughout medicine: Look at the big picture, not a single piece of data. Triangulate on the truth, using all the sources of information you have, no matter how good a single test. And don’t be shy about questioning a conclusion that doesn’t fully fit the facts.

(Reuters) - Nearly all 50 U.S. states have begun to allow some businesses to reopen and residents to move more freely, but only 14 states have met the federal government's guidelines for lifting measures aimed at fighting the pandemic, according to a Reuters analysis.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended states wait until their daily number of new COVID-19 cases falls for 14 days before easing social distancing restrictions.
Florida, Hawaii, Idaho, Louisiana, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New York and Pennsylvania have reported four to five weeks of declines in new cases, according to a Reuters analysis of data from the COVID Tracking Project, a volunteer-run effort to track the outbreak. 
Arkansas, Colorado, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island have reported declines for two weeks, the analysis showed.
(Open https://tmsnrt.rs/2WTOZDR in an external browser for a Reuters interactive)When asked by Reuters for comment, the CDC referred questions to the White House coronavirus task force. A White House representative did not respond to questions about how many states have met the CDC guidelines to reopen. White House officials have been saying for weeks that they believe there are many states that can safely reopen. 
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, warned on Tuesday that prematurely ending restrictions on commerce and social life could have dire consequences.
""There is a real risk that you will trigger an outbreak that you may not be able to control and, in fact, paradoxically, will set you back, not only leading to some suffering and death that could be avoided, but could even set you back on the road to try to get economic recovery,"" Fauci told Congress. 
Nationally, new cases of COVID-19, caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, are down 11% in the last week, according to the Reuters analysis. However, hot spots are emerging in some southern and western states, while the Northeast has seen new infections plunge. 
Nineteen of the states with at least 5,000 reported cases of COVID-19 are seeing infections rise, Reuters found.
Many state governors, concerned about the economic fallout from prolonged lockdowns, have said they would lift restrictions carefully and gradually, requiring businesses to maintain physical distance from customers and clean surfaces frequently.
HOT SPOTSKentucky had the largest surge in new cases in the nation with a 60% rise in the first week of May, due to widespread testing at a prison that revealed an outbreak. Alabama's new cases rose 41% even before retail stores, bars and salons reopened. In Mississippi, where diners are allowed inside restaurants, infections were up 19%.
Minnesota had the second-highest increase in new cases, up over 50% in early May, in part due to expanded testing of anyone with symptoms. Previously only a limited number of ill patients could get a test. 
Several western states are also seeing new cases rise. Washington state grappled with a devastating outbreak at a nursing home early in the U.S. epidemic but got new infections under control. In the past week, new cases have risen nearly 13%, even as only a few counties have allowed restaurants and other businesses to reopen.
New cases in California, which has maintained fairly strict lockdown measures, rose 14% in the last week. In Arizona, new infections rose over 17%. 
Analysts looking at cell phone data have reported an increase of movement around the country, even in states that have yet to reopen. 
WHERE NEW CASES ARE DECLININGThe main reason that new cases are down nationally is due to 33% declines in both New York and New Jersey -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- in the past week.
New York does not plan to lift any restrictions until at least May 15, while New Jersey has opened only outdoor recreation, such as state and county parks and golf courses. 
Cases in nearby Massachusetts, which remains mostly under lockdown, have fallen 26% and cases are down 12% in Rhode Island, where retail stores can reopen with limits on the number of customers.
Tennessee, one of the first states to reopen restaurants and retail stores, has seen the biggest drop in new cases in the nation, down nearly 49%. Michigan, which remains mostly closed except for manufacturing and auto plants, saw new cases drop 43%.

9,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/science/viruses-coranavirus-biology.html,The New York Times,2020-03-24,['Carl Zimmer'],Welcome to the Virosphere,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/24/science/23SCI-MEGAVIRUS/23SCI-MEGAVIRUS-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
In January, Chinese virologists isolated the virus that causes Covid-19. Earlier this month, a team of virologists gave this new virus a new name: SARS-CoV-2.
To do so, they had to move the virus to the head of a very, very long line.In recent years, scientists have discovered that the world of virus diversity — what they sometimes call the virosphere — is unimaginably vast. They have uncovered hundreds of thousands of new species that have yet to be named. And they suspect that there are millions, perhaps even trillions, of species waiting to be found.
“Suffice to say that we have only sampled a minuscule fraction of the virosphere,” said Edward Holmes of the University of Sydney in Australia.
With the discovery of viruses in the late 1800s, scientists soon recognized that different species caused different diseases — rabies and influenza, for example. Later, virologists learned how to recognize new kinds of viruses by growing them in labs, where subtler biological features emerged.
After decades of this painstaking work, virologists have officially named 6,828 species of viruses; the figure includes 1,000 or so that will be formally accepted in the next few weeks by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses. That’s a paltry count when you consider that entomologists have named 380,000 species of beetles alone.
But in recent years, virologists have changed the way they hunt. Now they look for bits of genetic material in samples — water, mud, blood — and use sophisticated computer programs to recognize viral genes.
Matthew Sullivan, a virologist at Ohio State University, has used this method to search for viruses that infect life in the ocean. He and his colleagues analyzed genetic material in seawater collected on a scientific voyage around the world. Some genes belonged to species already known to science. But many were new. In 2016, Dr. Sullivan and his colleagues reported over 15,000 viruses, each representing a new species.
That was more than twice as many species as all the previously identified viruses. And with that, Dr. Sullivan thought he and his colleagues had pretty much finished off the diversity of viruses in the sea. But they went on collecting more water, and invented new ways to search it for the genetic material of viruses. In 2019, they reported finding a total of 200,000 species.
“I’ve stopped saying, ‘We’re done,’” Dr. Sullivan said.Other researchers are discovering thousands of new viruses as well. “Right now, we are in the exponential phase,” said Dr. Jens H. Kuhn, the lead virologist at the Integrated Research Facility at Fort Detrick in Maryland. “If someone gives me a million dollars and I go out and sample sea cucumbers, I will present you with 10,000 new viruses.”
Formally describing a new virus remains a time-consuming task. When Chinese researchers isolated the Covid-19-causing virus earlier this year, they found that it had a distinctive crown of proteins. This hallmark told them that the virus belonged to the coronavirus family, which contains 39 known species. The World Health Organization used this finding to give the disease its name — Coronavirus Disease 2019, or Covid-19 for short.
To determine just what kind of coronavirus they were dealing with, virologists sequenced its genes. The virus was genetically similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak in 2002. In March, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses declared that the two viruses belonged to the same species. The virus that caused SARS is known as SARS-CoV. So they called the Covid-19-causing virus SARS-CoV-2.
The viruses that infect humans are the best understood of all. But only about 250 species of viruses choose us as their host — “an insignificant fraction of the virosphere infect humans,” Dr. Holmes said.
While hundreds of thousands of new species still await their own names, virologists believe that far more await discovery. Dr. Holmes estimates that the viruses infecting animals, plants, fungi and protozoans (a group called eukaryotes) number 100 million species.
Bacteria and other single-celled microbes belong to a group called prokaryotes. In a paper published on March 4 in Microbiology and Molecular Biology Reviews, Dr. Kuhn and his colleagues argued that there are, at minimum, 100 million species of viruses that infect prokaryotes.
But some researchers suspect there are many more species of prokaryotes in the world — which would mean many more species of viruses. The true figure might be as high as 10 trillion.
For each of those species, scientists will have to figure out how it is related to other viruses. That is far harder to determine for viruses than for familiar life-forms like animals and plants.
Scientists who study animals and plants can rely on the tried and true classification system first established by Carl Linnaeus in the 1700s. Our species belongs to the class Mammalia, for instance, and, above that, the animal kingdom. Virologists have struggled to figure out the classes and kingdoms of the virosphere. Part of the problem is that viruses have a penchant for trading genes with other species, making it hard to draw bright lines between groups of them.
And very often, a new virus simply makes no sense. An extreme example came to light in February when scientists searching for viruses in a lake found a new one they named Yaravirus. Of Yaravirus’s 74 genes, 68 are unlike any ever found in any virus.
In recent years, Dr. Kuhn and his colleagues have sought to tame this chaos. They have developed what they call a “megataxonomy” to classify viruses that seems to work. The team sorted viruses based on whether they carried one or more of a few “hallmark genes.” They also looked for groups of species that trade genes among each other, and less so with other groups.
“A coherent account of the global organization of the virus world is now within reach,” they wrote in their new paper. Dr. Kuhn, in an interview, said, “We were all a bit surprised this system is so logical in the end.”
Dr. Kuhn and his colleagues submitted their system to the taxonomy committee, and he said it would likely be accepted soon. Still, the megataxonomy is far from complete. Yaravirus, for instance, still floats on its own, lonely and unclassifiable.
Some researchers are skeptical about the megataxonomy. Dr. Holmes thinks it is too soon to attempt one, given that researchers have found so few viruses. “Why build something so rigid when it may just fall as we sample more?” he asked. Dr. Kuhn argues that it’s worth starting to build a system, even if it needs to be adjusted later.
Making sense of the virosphere is not just an intellectually challenging puzzle, Dr. Kuhn said. At Fort Dietrick, he runs experiments on some of the world’s most dangerous viruses, such as Ebola and SARS-CoV-2. A better understanding of the virosphere could help him and his colleagues come up with ways to combat these threats and others we don’t even know about yet.
“We have to understand what is out there,” he said."
10,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/us/coronavirus-death-rate.html,The New York Times,2020-04-17,['Amy Harmon'],Why We Don’t Know the True Death Rate for Covid-19,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/16/us/16virus-deathrate01/16virus-deathrate01-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
Coroners in some parts of the country are overwhelmed. Funeral homes in coronavirus hot spots can barely keep up. Newspaper obituary pages in hard-hit areas go on and on. Covid-19 is on track to kill far more people in the United States this year than the seasonal flu.
But determining just how deadly the new coronavirus will be is a key question facing epidemiologists, who expect resurgent waves of infection that could last into 2022.
As the virus spread across the world in late February and March, the projection circulated by infectious disease experts of how many infected people would die seemed plenty dire: around 1 percent, or 10 times the rate of a typical flu.
But according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the death rate by dividing total deaths by the number of known cases, about 6.4 percent of people infected with the virus have now died worldwide.
In Italy, the death rate stands at about 13 percent, and in the United States, around 4.3 percent, according to the latest figures on known cases and deaths. Even in South Korea, where widespread testing helped contain the outbreak, 2 percent of people who tested positive for the virus have died, recent data shows.
These supposed death rates also appear to vary widely by geography: Germany’s fatality rate appears to be roughly one-tenth of Italy’s, and Los Angeles’s about half of New York’s. Among U.S. states, Michigan, at around 7 percent, is at the high end, while Wyoming, which reported its first two deaths this week, has one of the lowest death rates, at about 0.7 percent.
Virology experts say there is no evidence that any strain of the virus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, has mutated to become more severe in some parts of the world than others, raising the question of why there appears to be so much variance from country to country.
Determining death rates is especially challenging in the midst of a pandemic, while figures are necessarily fluid. Fatality rates based on comparing deaths, which are relatively easy to count, to infections, which are not, almost certainly overestimate the true lethality of the virus, epidemiologists say. Health officials and epidemiologists have estimated there are five to 10 people with undetected infections for every confirmed case in some communities, and at least one estimate suggests there are far more.
On top of that, deaths lag infections. The thousands of people with Covid-19 who died this week in the United States were most likely infected as far back as a month ago. So as the number of new cases reported begins to fall in hard-hit places like New York City, the death rate will almost certainly rise.
“To know the fatality rate you need to know how many people are infected and how many people died from the disease,” said Ali H. Mokdad, a professor of health metrics sciences at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. “We know how many people are dying, but we don’t know how many people are infected.”
In fact, even the number of people dying is a moving target. Covid-19 deaths that happen at home appear to be widely underreported. And New York City increased its death count by more than 3,700 on Tuesday, after officials said they were now including people who had never tested positive for the virus but were presumed to have died of it.
But the missing data on deaths in the deaths-to-infections ratio is still almost certain to be dwarfed by the expected increase in the denominator when the total number of infections is better understood, epidemiologists say. The statistic typically cited by mayors and governors at Covid-19 news conferences relies on a data set that includes mostly people whose symptoms were severe enough to be tested.
Epidemiologists call it “severity bias.” It is why the fatality rate in Wuhan, China, where the outbreak began, was reported to be between 2 percent and 3.4 percent before it was revised to 1.4 percent, and it may yet be lower.
One intriguing case study for epidemiologists looking for the true fatality rate is the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which became a kind of natural experiment when nearly all of its 3,711 passengers and crew members were tested for the coronavirus after an outbreak on board.
The ship’s “case fatality rate,” which included only those who showed symptoms, was 2.6 percent, according to a study by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, while the “infection fatality rate,” which included those who tested positive yet remained asymptomatic, was 1.3 percent. (A cruise ship, in which people are in a confined space, is not representative of the more dynamic situation in cities). The known number of coronavirus cases worldwide is about two million, and at least 127,000 of those patients have died. The United States has an estimated 600,000 reported cases and more than 25,000 deaths, the most in the world. But many people infected with the virus have no symptoms, or only mild ones, and appear in no official tally.
Facing a shortage of tests to confirm who has the disease and who does not, and fearing a shortage of I.C.U. beds, hospitals in some areas of the United States have declined to test or admit people whose oxygen saturation is above 90 percent.
Whether a particular locale tests people with even mild symptoms is a key factor in determining how many people were infected, but testing capacity has been limited in many places.
“People with mild symptoms, I just send them home,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, and a critical care physician in Pittsburgh. “All of this is creating disparities in case-fatality ratios that don’t reflect real differences.”
Even with testing now becoming more widely available for Americans with Covid-19 symptoms, the proportion of people infected by the virus who do not feel appreciably sick is unknown, including in places with some of the highest deaths per 100,000 people: New York (55), Spain (40), Belgium (36), Italy (35), New Jersey (32), France (23) and Louisiana (22).
A clue comes from Iceland, which has tested 6 percent of its population, perhaps the highest proportion of any country. Of those who tested positive, 43 percent had no symptoms at the time, though it is likely that many developed them later.
What scientists call the infection fatality rate is so closely watched because even a seemingly trivial decrease — from, say, 1.0 percent to 0.9 percent — could mean a few hundred thousand fewer deaths in a population the size of the United States. It is also used to calibrate interventions aimed at preventing more deaths with their grim economic consequences.
Over the coming months, tests that can identify antibodies in the blood of people who were unwittingly exposed to the virus will allow for a closer approximation of total infections in different populations.
Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health recently announced that they would begin using antibody tests to see what proportion of the U.S. population has already been infected. Covid-19 may prove to be less lethal than initial predictions, with an infection fatality rate of under 1 percent, as suggested in an editorial published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Anthony S. Fauci and Dr. H. Clifford Lane, both of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Robert R. Redfield, director of the C.D.C.
But the public should not take a false comfort in death-rate statistics that might suddenly seem lower, epidemiologists warn.
The infection fatality rate of seasonal flu strains, which kill tens of thousands of Americans each year, is about 0.1 percent. And as Dr. Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease official, told lawmakers in March when he was urging them to take serious mitigation efforts, the coronavirus “is a really serious problem.”
The inconsistencies in the number of coronavirus cases and deaths in different parts of the United States, according to a C.D.C. report released this week, depend on numerous factors: when the first cases of the virus arrived in a region; its population density; and the age distribution and prevalence of underlying medical conditions in its population. Also important are the timing and extent of community mitigation measures introduced by a region’s public officials, its diagnostic testing capacity and its public-health reporting practices.
The same factors most likely apply to the jumble of outcomes across the globe. But which ones end up fueling or mitigating a local outbreak, infectious disease experts say, can be hard to tease out.
The disparity between New York, with 55 deaths per 100,000 people, and California, with two, for instance, has been widely attributed to the imposition of earlier stay-at-home orders in California, which already had a work-at-home culture prepared to embrace the restrictions. But what about New York’s role as the business capital of the world, where travelers returning from Europe unwittingly introduced the coronavirus by mid-February? Or its high population density, which the C.D.C. report suggests may significantly accelerate the transmission of a disease spread by droplets of mucus or saliva?
“The comparison of New York to California is a little unfair in a way,” said Dr. Mokdad of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. “Yes, in California, the governor put in the shutdown order faster, we shouldn’t take that away from them. But the deck of cards are stacked more against New York.”
Italy’s large number of cases, which overwhelmed its health care system, may be linked to its having the second-oldest population in the world after Japan; likewise The New York Times has identified more than 7,000 deaths at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities across the United States with coronavirus cases.
And the alarming number of African-Americans across many states being killed by Covid-19, health experts said, is likely to be related to higher rates of health conditions, rooted in longstanding economic and health care inequalities, that make it harder for them to survive the infection.
“The state number is an average that masks disparities by county, or even within a county,” Dr. Mokdad said. “Covid-19 is coming on top of underlying population diversity and disparities in health in the United States, and many communities will suffer from it more than other communities.”
Even as parts of the country edge toward reopening, cases are rising in Florida and other Southern states whose governors delayed closing beaches and dine-in restaurants. And it is the virus’s transmission rate, as much as its infection fatality rate, that is preoccupying public health experts trying to find a way forward.
“Everyone in the whole country is vulnerable to this,” said Andrew Noymer, an associate professor of public health at the University of California, Irvine. “Nobody has pre-immunity. That’s totally unlike flu. So New York had some early cases, it spread like crazy. But why is Des Moines not going to have a Covid epidemic? What’s so special about Springfield, Ill.? Social distancing will end. And people will start getting it again and dying.”"
11,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/new-york-coronavirus-cases-europe-genomes.html,The New York Times,2020-04-09,['Carl Zimmer'],"Most New York Coronavirus Cases Came From Europe, Genomes Show",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/14/science/09VIRUS-MUTATIONS1/09VIRUS-MUTATIONS1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
New research indicates that the coronavirus began to circulate in the New York area by mid-February, weeks before the first confirmed case, and that travelers brought in the virus mainly from Europe, not Asia.
“The majority is clearly European,” said Harm van Bakel, a geneticist at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, who co-wrote a study awaiting peer review.
A separate team at N.Y.U. Grossman School of Medicine came to strikingly similar conclusions, despite studying a different group of cases. Both teams analyzed genomes from coronaviruses taken from New Yorkers starting in mid-March.
The research revealed a previously hidden spread of the virus that might have been detected if aggressive testing programs had been put in place.
On Jan. 31, President Trump barred foreign nationals from entering the country if they had been in China during the prior two weeks.
It would not be until late February that Italy would begin locking down towns and cities, and March 11 when Mr. Trump said he would block travelers from most European countries. But New Yorkers had already been traveling home with the virus.
“People were just oblivious,” said Adriana Heguy, a member of the N.Y.U. team.Dr. Heguy and Dr. van Bakel belong to an international guild of viral historians. They ferret out the history of outbreaks by poring over clues embedded in the genetic material of viruses taken from thousands of patients.
Viruses invade a cell and take over its molecular machinery, causing it to make new viruses.The process is quick and sloppy. As a result, new viruses can gain a new mutation that wasn’t present in their ancestor. If a new virus manages to escape its host and infect other people, its descendants will inherit that mutation.
Tracking viral mutations demands sequencing all the genetic material in a virus — its genome. Once researchers have gathered the genomes from a number of virus samples, they can compare their mutations.
Sophisticated computer programs can then figure out how all of those mutations arose as viruses descended from a common ancestor. If they get enough data, they can make rough estimates about how long ago those ancestors lived. That’s because mutations arise at a roughly regular pace, like a molecular clock.
Maciej Boni of Penn State University and his colleagues recently used this method to see where the coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, came from in the first place. While conspiracy theories might falsely claim the virus was concocted in a lab, the virus’s genome makes clear that it arose in bats.
There are many kinds of coronaviruses, which infect both humans and animals. Dr. Boni and his colleagues found that the genome of the new virus contains a number of mutations in common with strains of coronaviruses that infect bats.
The most closely related coronavirus is in a Chinese horseshoe bat, the researchers found. But the new virus has gained some unique mutations since splitting off from that bat virus decades ago.
Dr. Boni said that ancestral virus probably gave rise to a number of strains that infected horseshoe bats, and perhaps sometimes other animals.
“Very likely there’s a vast unsampled diversity,” he said.Copying mistakes aren’t the only way for new viruses to arise. Sometimes two kinds of coronaviruses will infect the same cell. Their genetic material gets mixed up in new viruses.
It’s entirely possible, Dr. Boni said, in the past 10 or 20 years, a hybrid virus arose in some horseshoe bat that was well-suited to infect humans, too. Later, that virus somehow managed to cross the species barrier.
“Once in a while, one of these viruses wins the lottery,” he said.In January, a team of Chinese and Australian researchers published the first genome of the new virus. Since then, researchers around the world have sequenced over 3,000 more. Some are genetically identical to each other, while others carry distinctive mutations.
That’s just a tiny sampling of the full diversity of the virus. As of April 8, there were 1.5 million confirmed cases of Covid-19, and the true total is probably many millions more. But already, the genomes of the virus are revealing previously hidden outlines of its history over the past few months.
As new genomes come to light, researchers upload them to an online database called GISAID. A team of virus evolution experts are analyzing the growing collection of genomes in a project called Nextstrain. They continually update the virus family tree.
The deepest branches of the tree all belong to lineages from China. The Nextstrain team has also used the mutation rate to determine that the virus probably first moved into humans from an animal host in late 2019. On Dec. 31, China announced that doctors in Wuhan were treating dozens of cases of a mysterious new respiratory illness.
In January, as the scope of the catastrophe in China became clear, a few countries started an aggressive testing program. They were able to track the arrival of the virus on their territory and track its spread through their populations.
But the United States fumbled in making its first diagnostic kits and initially limited testing only to people who had come from China and displayed symptoms of Covid-19.
“It was a disaster that we didn’t do testing,” Dr. Heguy said.A few cases came to light starting at the end of January. But it was easy to dismiss them as rare imports that did not lead to local outbreaks.
The illusion was dashed at the end of February by Trevor Bedford, an associate professor at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington, and his colleagues.
Using Nextstrain, they showed that a virus identified in a patient in late February had mutation shared by one identified in Washington on Jan. 20.
The Washington viruses also shared other mutations in common with ones isolated in Wuhan, suggesting that a traveler had brought the coronavirus from China.
With that discovery, Dr. Bedford and his colleagues took the lead in sequencing coronavirus genomes. Sequencing more genomes around Washington gave them a better view of how the outbreak there got started.
“I’m quite confident that it was not spreading in December in the United States,” Dr. Bedford said. “There may have been a couple other introductions in January that didn’t take off in the same way.”
As new cases arose in other parts of the country, other researchers set up their own pipelines. The first positive test result in New York came on March 1, and after a couple of weeks, patients surged into the city’s hospitals.
“I thought, ‘We need to do this for New York,’” Dr. Heguy said.Dr. Heguy and her colleagues found some New York viruses that shared unique mutations not found elsewhere. “That’s when you know you’ve had a silent transmission for a while,” she said.
Dr. Heguy estimated that the virus began circulating in the New York area a couple of months ago.And researchers at Mount Sinai started sequencing the genomes of patients coming through their hospital. They found that the earliest cases identified in New York were not linked to later ones.
“Two weeks later, we start seeing viruses related to each other,” said Ana Silvia Gonzalez-Reiche, a member of the Mount Sinai team.
Dr. Gonzalez-Reiche and her colleagues found that these viruses were practically identical to viruses found around Europe. They cannot say on what particular flight a particular virus arrived in New York. But they write that the viruses reveal “a period of untracked global transmission between late January to mid-February.”
So far, the Mount Sinai researchers have identified seven separate lineages of viruses that entered New York and began circulating. “We will probably find more,” Dr. van Bakel said.
The coronavirus genomes are also revealing hints of early cross-country travel.Dr. van Bakel and his colleagues found one New York virus that was identical to one of the Washington viruses found by Dr. Bedford and his colleagues. In a separate study, researchers at Yale found another Washington-related virus. Combined, the two studies hint that the coronavirus has been moving from coast to coast for several weeks.
Sidney Bell, a computational biologist working with the Nextstrain team, cautions people not to read too much into these new mutations themselves. “Just because something is different doesn’t mean it matters,” Dr. Bell said.
Mutations do not automatically turn viruses into new, fearsome strains. They often don’t bring about any change at all. “To me, mutations are inevitable and kind of boring,” Dr. Bell said. “But in the movies, you get the X-Men.”
Peter Thielen, a molecular biologist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, likes to think of the spread of viruses like a dandelion seed landing on an empty field.
The flower grows up and produces seeds of its own. Those seeds spread and sprout. New mutations arise over the generations as the dandelions fill the field. “But they’re all still dandelions,” Mr. Thielen said.
While the coronavirus mutations are useful for telling lineages apart, they don’t have any apparent effect on how the virus works.
That’s good news for scientists working on a vaccine.Vaccine developers hope to fight Covid-19 by teaching our bodies to make antibodies that can grab onto the virus and block its entry into cells.
Some viruses evolve so quickly that they require vaccines that can produce several different antibodies. That’s not the case for Covid-19. Like other coronaviruses, it has a relatively slow mutation rate compared to some viruses, like influenza.
As hard as the fight against it may be, its mutations reveal that things can be a whole lot worse.Of course, the coronavirus will continue to mutate as long as it still infects people. It’s possible that vaccines will have to change to keep up with the virus. And that’s why scientists need to keep tracking its history.

This article was last updated on March 19, and is no longer being updated. This is a fast-moving situation, so some information may be outdated. For the latest updates, read The New York Times’s live coronavirus coverage here.The new coronavirus is spreading rapidly throughout the world — and parents are increasingly on edge. More than 180,000 have been sickened worldwide, and more than 7,000 have died since an outbreak began in December in Wuhan, China. In the United States, cases have been rising rapidly as officials ramp up testing across the country.
On March 11, the World Health Organization announced that the spread of the coronavirus had officially become a pandemic. “Bottom line: It’s going to get worse,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that same day at a congressional hearing.
As the outbreak picks up steam, infectious disease experts in the United States, while not panicked, are expressing concern. “There’s a whole spectrum of opinions out there as to how worried we should be,” said Dr. H. Cody Meissner, M.D., chief of the division of pediatric infectious disease at Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases.
He noted that while there has not yet been as huge a surge of hospitalizations and deaths from the disease in the United States as there were in places like in China and Italy, “that doesn’t mean the tsunami that everyone says is coming won’t,” he added. “But as of right now, this seems primarily a disease of elderly patients who are frail, and who have other, coexisting health conditions such as heart or lung disease, or Type 2 diabetes.”
But if you’re a parent or expecting, should you be worried? Here’s what to know.What is a coronavirus?The term “coronavirus” refers to a family of viruses; “think of them as a large group of cousins, who are similar in many ways,” said Dr. William Schaffner, M.D., a professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Many live exclusively in animals, but scientists have identified seven different strains, including the latest one, SARS-CoV-2, which can infect people.
The strains that typically infect humans generally cause symptoms that are no more severe than the common cold. But “every once in a while, a rogue coronavirus jumps from animals to humans, and is more severe,” Dr. Schaffner said. That’s what happened with the SARS coronavirus, which was responsible for a deadly epidemic in 2003 and was believed to have spread to civet cats from bats before infecting humans in the Guangdong province of southern China in 2002. Similarly, the MERS coronavirus, which was first identified in 2012, spread from bats to camels to people in Saudi Arabia, and has since been responsible for at least 858 deaths.
Experts think the new coronavirus originally came from a bat, but are unclear on how it spread directly to humans. Many people originally infected with it in Wuhan had a link to a large seafood and live animal market, which suggests infected animals there spread the disease.
Why are experts so concerned about this new coronavirus?Unlike other, more mild coronaviruses, this one is causing many deaths. Experts still don’t know much about it, including how contagious it is or how it spreads. “Right now, we’re basing it on a historical perspective of SARS and MERS, which both caused hundreds of deaths,” said Dr. Meissner.
At the moment, the new coronavirus seems to be milder than SARS or MERS. “It looks like most of the deaths so far have occurred in older adults, who had other coexisting health conditions such as heart disease or diabetes,” Dr. Schaffner said. “But obviously, it still has the potential to make many people so sick that they end up in the hospital.”
How different is it from the common cold or flu?Coronavirus infections, in general, are virtually indistinguishable from other respiratory infections. In mild cases, they cause a runny nose, cough, sore throat, fatigue and fever. With the new coronavirus, patients tend to have a fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. But from a physician’s perspective, if a patient comes in with respiratory symptoms, a doctor can’t tell just from examining them what they have, said Dr. Schaffner.
As a precaution, many medical centers across the country are now asking patients with respiratory symptoms or a fever to call first before showing up. If you do need to be seen, you may be asked to wear a mask and to be put in isolation as a precaution to avoid spreading disease.
Do I need to stockpile face masks?No. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been recommending that only infected patients and their health care providers wear N95 respirator masks, which are a special type of mask intended to filter out 95 percent of airborne particles. But there’s limited evidence of their utility even among these groups, said Dr. Mark J. Mulligan, M.D., division director of the infectious diseases and vaccine center at NYU Langone Medical Center. When physicians treat a person infected with the disease caused by the virus, they wear “a face shield, gown and gloves,” he said. “There’s no good research to suggest that wearing a N95 mask when you’re out in public, even if there’s an outbreak in your area, will shield you against the disease.”
Standard surgical masks also can’t fully protect you from contracting the virus.Should parents be worried?It’s understandable that parents might feel panicked during these uncertain times, but the most important thing you can do is be cautious. Children seem to be largely spared from developing severe symptoms resulting from Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. When they do get it, they tend to have much milder symptoms, said Dr. Meissner.
According to a report published in JAMA in February, the majority of patients with Covid-19 in China were between 49 and 56 years old. The bigger concern for parents is that your child could pass it on to someone else. “Even if children are mildly ill, they serve as reservoirs of infection and can spread disease to adults, especially the elderly,” said Dr. Bessey E. Geevarghese, D.O., a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at Lurie Children’s at Northwestern Medicine Central DuPage Hospital.
What steps should parents take at this point?You should take the same precautions you would take to protect your child from the common cold or flu. “We know for sure that it spreads readily from person to person, akin to influenza,” Dr. Schaffner said of the new coronavirus. “We also now think it can spread from people who are infected with the virus, but not yet showing symptoms. We don’t know if this is a frequent occurrence, but it can happen.”
For these reasons, it’s important to practice what’s known as social distancing. This means staying at home and binging on TV, rather than socializing in groups. Schools are closing, at least temporarily, and people who can work from home are encouraged to do so. On March 16, the Trump Administration announced new guidelines aimed at stopping the spread of the new coronavirus, including closing schools and avoiding bars, food courts, restaurants and groups of more than 10 people.
“We do not have appropriate drugs or vaccines for this virus at this time, so social distancing can go a long way to decrease the rapid spread of virus,” said Dr. Geevarghese.
Experts also say it might be a good idea to avoid taking your children to playgrounds, and to limit play dates.
As always, encourage children to wash their hands frequently and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. (Alcohol-based hand sanitizers can work in a pinch, but they’re generally not as effective as soap and water, Dr. Meissner added.) Hands should be washed before children eat, after they use the bathroom, come inside from outdoors or touch something dirty like garbage. If you see someone coughing or sneezing, try to keep your kids as far away from them as possible. “We believe that the respiratory secretions from coronaviruses can’t travel more than six feet,” Dr. Meissner explained.
For now, Dr. Schaffner said, if you and your kids still haven’t received a flu shot, get one. According to the C.D.C., flu activity is still high in the United States, and has caused anywhere from 22,000 to 55,000 deaths so far this season, with at least 144 in children. “Parents are used to the flu, so they don’t worry as much about it,” Dr. Schaffner said. “But taking steps to protect their children from it are much more important.”
Is it safe to travel?Health experts are urging people to avoid any nonessential travel at this point — especially if you’re an older adult or have a serious underlying health issue. The State Department has issued a global Level 3 health advisory, telling U.S. citizens to “reconsider travel” abroad. And while there haven’t yet been any bans on travel within the United States, President Trump said that he hasn’t ruled them out.
If you have to travel, check the State Department and C.D.C.’s travel pages before you go. Both the State Department and the C.D.C. are warning Americans not to travel on cruise ships at this time.
Also consider the possibility that if you go on a trip, you might not be able to get back; or you might be subject to certain quarantines if you become ill or come in contact with someone who has tested positive for Covid-19.
I’m pregnant. Should I be concerned?There isn’t much information on how the new coronavirus affects pregnancies, though preliminary research suggests it isn’t likely to be transmitted from a mother to her baby through the womb. A study published in February in The Lancet followed nine pregnant women who were infected in Wuhan. All of the newborns, who were delivered via cesarean section, tested negative for the coronavirus, and there were no traces of the virus in the mother’s amniotic fluid, cord blood or breast milk. While there have been news media reports of one newborn who tested positive for the virus 30 hours after being born, “it’s not clear if it was transmitted across the placenta, or if the infant got the virus shortly after birth from its mother,” Dr. Schaffner said.
For now, you should take the same precautions you would take to protect yourself from the flu. During pregnancy, parts of your immune system are depressed, which makes you more susceptible to complications from viruses such as influenza and chickenpox, explained Dr. Steven Gordon, M.D., an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic. (Pregnant women, for example, are nearly 3.5 times more likely to end up in the hospital from the flu than women who aren’t expecting, according to a study published in June 2019 in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.) “It makes sense that a pregnant woman would be at higher risk of complications from this virus than a nonpregnant one,” he said.
The C.D.C. does caution that it has observed miscarriage and stillbirth in pregnant women infected with other related coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV). High fever during the first trimester of pregnancy — which can happen after infection with the new coronavirus and with illnesses such as a cold or flu — can also increase the risk of certain birth defects, including spina bifida, cleft lip and anencephaly (where a baby is born without parts of the brain and skull).

13,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/health/coronavirus-mail-packages.html,The New York Times,2020-03-24,['Nicola Twilley'],You’ve Got Mail. Will You Get the Coronavirus?,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/31/science/24VIRUS-MAIL1/24VIRUS-MAIL1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
Scientists agree that the main means by which the SARS-CoV-2 virus jumps from an infected person to its next host is by hitching a ride in the tiny droplets that are sprayed into the air with each cough or sneeze. But with deliveries now at holiday levels as locked-down Americans shop online rather than in person, the question remains: Can you catch the coronavirus from the parcels and packages your overburdened mail carrier keeps leaving at your door?
The first formal process for curbing the spread of infection by detaining travelers from an affected region until their health was proved was instituted in what is now Dubrovnik, Croatia, in 1377, against the bubonic plague. (This temporal buffer was originally 30 days, but when that proved too short, it was extended to 40 days, or quaranta giorni, from which we derive the word “quarantine.”)
Mail disinfection soon followed, as the then Republic of Venice extended and formalized the quarantine process to include cargo. Items that were considered particularly susceptible, including textiles and letters, were also subject to fumigation: dipped in or sprinkled with vinegar, then often exposed to smoke from aromatic substances, from rosemary to, in later years, chlorine. Once the items were treated, a distinctive wax seal or cancellation was usually applied to them, so the recipient would know where and when the disinfection had been carried out. (Such marks often provide the only remaining evidence of the ebb and flow of disease; some minor outbreaks of plague or typhus in remote areas of medieval Europe, for example, would have been lost to history without their postal traces.)
The diseases changed, but for centuries mail disinfection techniques remained largely the same. As recently as 1900, during a plague outbreak in Honolulu, letters were routinely disinfected by clipping off the two opposite corners of each envelope and then spreading a batch of mail out in an airtight room filled with sulfur fumes for three hours.
A representative for the U.S. Postal Service was unwilling to discuss current sanitization protocols. But the agency’s website reports that the only mail items receiving treatment are letters and parcels sent to ZIP codes beginning in 202, 203, 204 and 205, which serve federal government agencies in Washington, D.C. In a process that began shortly after the 2001 anthrax attacks, the Postal Service sends mail destined for those ZIP codes to New Jersey, where they are put on a conveyor belt and passed under a high-energy beam of ionizing radiation that kills bacteria and viruses. The letters and packages are then “aired out” for a while, before being forwarded to their destinations. The paper is left slightly faded and somewhat crispy, but sterile.
Should mail irradiation be extended beyond these exclusive ZIP codes, to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus? On CBS News’s Face the Nation on Sunday morning, Scott Gottlieb, the former commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, warned that SARS-CoV-2 could potentially be transmitted by contaminated objects. “This is a sticky virus,” he said. The structure of the coronavirus’s protective envelope helps it bond tightly to certain surfaces: skin in particular, as well as fabric and wood, but also plastic and steel.
Some government agencies seem concerned that all of that circulating paper might be a potential vector. In early February, when COVID-19 was still just “the coronavirus” — and, for most Americans, still someone else’s problem — China’s central bank announced that it would quarantine the country’s cash, to prevent the disease from spreading from one person to another on money. The government collected bank notes from Hubei, the worst-hit province, and then sanitized the stacks of bills, either by baking them at a high temperature or bathing them in ultraviolet rays. The newly laundered cash was then kept in isolation for seven to 14 days before being rereleased into the banking system.
A few weeks later, the U.S. Federal Reserve began quarantining dollar bills repatriated from Asia, holding them for seven to 10 days before allowing them to re-enter the domestic financial system. Bank notes are made of cotton pulp, not wood fiber, but still: Why sanitize money and not mail?
Representatives of the big three package deliverers in the United States — U.P.S., FedEx and the Postal Service — insisted there is no need. “The C.D.C. has advised that there is a low risk of transmission on packages,” said Matthew O’Connor, a spokesman for U.P.S. FedEx, in a statement, said: “The guidance from the W.H.O. is that the likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low, and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved, traveled, and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low.”
David Partenheimer, a spokesman for the Postal Service, noted that the surgeon general, Dr. Jerome M. Adams, along with the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization, has “indicated that there is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is being spread through the mail.”
This is because many scientists think it is quite unlikely that you can catch the coronavirus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and subsequently touching your own mouth or nose. (One review of scientific publications on the subject concluded that hand washing seems to cut the risk of respiratory infection by a mere 16 percent — but added that the studies examined were of poor quality and more research was urgently needed.)
The German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment — Germany’s equivalent of the F.D.A. — advises that while the virus could, theoretically, be transmitted through this kind of “smear” infection, as opposed to the standard “droplet” infection, there have been no known cases in which individuals have caught the coronavirus by touching a contaminated surface and then transferring the virus to their mouth or nose. Then again, contact transmission is notoriously difficult to study and document.
A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine last week shed more light on the subject. A group of researchers from the National Institutes of Health, the C.D.C., Princeton University and the University of California, Los Angeles, misted virus particles into a rotating drum and studied how long the floating particles survived on various surfaces. They found that the SARS-CoV-2 virus survived for up to 24 hours on cardboard — three times longer than its cousin, the original SARS.
“In that light, you might expect the virus to remain viable for hours but probably not days on mail,” said James Lloyd-Smith, one of the study’s authors. “But there are important caveats.”
Among these: The study specifically looked at aerosolized virus particles, rather than the fine droplets that infected people emit with each cough or sneeze. The line between aerosols and droplets is fuzzy, but, broadly, droplets are bigger and settle more quickly, while aerosols are smaller and float for longer.
“Little is known about the rate at which infected people generate such aerosolized viruses,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said, although some medical procedures — including intubation to assist with breathing — are known to create aerosols. In addition, the experiment was designed to simulate indoor air; viruses like this one are expected to be stable for longer at lower temperatures and lower humidity.
In an experiment that might better mimic the effect of sneezing on a letter, researchers from Hong Kong University pipetted droplets of SARS-CoV-2 onto various surfaces. Their results, which have not yet been peer reviewed and do not include details on temperature and humidity conditions, found no infectious virus left on paper after three hours — although, alarmingly, a significant level could be detected on the outer layer of a surgical mask after seven days.
“The bottom line is that there is some hypothetical risk of viable viruses surviving on mail,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said. “But given the time periods involved, this seems like a pretty minimal risk to the general public.”
Ben Chapman, a food safety specialist at North Carolina State University who studies the interaction of pathogens and surfaces, agreed that although the virus can persist on packages, these have not been identified as a risk factor for transmission. Nonetheless, he said, “I’d just wash my hands after handling,” rather than spray with Lysol or wipe with bleach. “I want to preserve the good sanitizers for risky things, and hand washing works just as well as spraying.”
For the delivery workers pulling 12-hour shifts to keep up with demand, and struggling to access the sanitizing supplies and hand-washing facilities they need, the situation is potentially riskier. “I would be more worried about the mail sorters and mail carriers, who are exposed to many more pieces of mail,” Dr. Lloyd-Smith said.
Delivery is deemed an “essential function” by the Department of Homeland Security, and the volume of packages is expected only to increase as more Americans are required to shelter in place. Irradiating all mail is both overkill and likely impossible, given the volumes in question and the resources required. But making sure that the people who are keeping mail moving during this pandemic are protected also seems essential, not to mention ethical.
“The safety and well-being of U.S. Postal Service employees and customers is our highest priority,” said Mr. Partenheimer, who added that the agency is closely monitoring the situation to implement C.D.C. and public health department advice."

Nearly 70 drugs and experimental compounds may be effective in treating the coronavirus, a team of researchers reported on Sunday night.
Some of the medications are already used to treat other diseases, and repurposing them to treat Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, may be faster than trying to invent a new antiviral from scratch, the scientists said.
The list of drug candidates appeared in a study published on the web site bioRxiv. The researchers have submitted the paper to a journal for publication.
To come up with the list, hundreds of researchers embarked on an unusual study of the genes of the coronavirus, also called SARS-CoV-2.
To infect a lung cell, the coronavirus must insert its genes, co-opting the cell’s own genetic machinery. The cell begins to produce viral proteins, which are used to produce millions of new viruses.
Each of those viral proteins must be able to latch onto the necessary human proteins for the process to work.
In the new study, the scientists investigated 26 of the coronavirus’s 29 genes, which direct production of the viral proteins. The researchers found 332 human proteins targeted by the coronavirus.
Some viral proteins seemed to target just one human protein; other viral proteins are capable of targeting a dozen human cellular proteins.
The researchers sought drugs that also latch onto the human proteins that the coronavirus seems to need to enter and replicate in human cells. The team eventually identified 24 drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat such seemingly unrelated diseases as cancer, Parkinson’s disease and hypertension.
On the list were such unexpected candidates as haloperidol, used to treat schizophrenia, and metformin, taken by people with Type 2 diabetes.
The investigators also found candidates among compounds that are now in clinical trials or that are the subject of early research. Intriguingly, some of the possible treatments are drugs used to attack parasites.
And the list includes antibiotics that kill bacteria by gumming up the cellular machinery they use to build proteins. But some of those drugs also attach to human proteins. The new study raises the possibility that this side effect might turn out to be an antiviral treatment.
One drug on the list, chloroquine, kills the single-celled parasite that causes malaria. Scientists have long known that it can also attach to a human cellular protein called the sigma-1 receptor. And that receptor is also the target of the virus.
Chloroquine has been much in the news this past week, thanks to speculation about its use against the coronavirus — some of which was repeated by President Trump at a news briefing at the White House on Friday.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, followed the president’s remarks with a warning that there was only “anecdotal evidence” that chloroquine might work.
Only well-run trials could establish whether chloroquine was safe and effective against the coronavirus, Dr. Fauci said.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization announced it would begin a trial on chloroquine, among other drugs.
And on Sunday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced that the state had obtained large amount of chloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin to start its own drug trial.
Nevan Krogan, a biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who led the new study, warned that chloroquine might have many toxic side effects, because the drug appears to target many human cellular proteins.
“You need to be careful,” he said. “We need more data at every level.”Dr. Krogan’s collaborators at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York and the Pasteur Institute in Paris have started testing 22 of the other compounds on the list against live coronavirus grown in their laboratories.
On Sunday night, they were still awaiting the first results."

Came Back Normal After a Seizure. Could It Be Covid-19?,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/03/magazine/03mag-diagnosis-1/03mag-diagnosis-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
“Honey” — the woman could hear fear tightening her husband’s voice as he called out to her — “I think your mother just died.” She ran into the living room. Her 78-year-old mother sat rigid in a chair, her skin gray and lifeless. Her eyes were open but all white, as if she were trying to see the back of her own skull. Then her arms started to make little jerking movements; her lips parted as saliva seeped out the corner of her mouth onto her chin. Then her body slumped. She seemed awake but confused after this seizure-like episode.
Should I call an ambulance? the husband asked. No, his wife responded. Her mother had a complicated medical history, including a kidney transplant 12 years before and an autoimmune disease. An ambulance would want to take her to the nearby Hartford Hospital. But her doctors were at Yale New Haven Hospital — some 30 miles from their home in Cromwell, Conn. They helped the woman into the car. It was only a half-hour drive to the hospital that March 10 evening, but it seemed to last forever. Would her mother make it? Her eyes were closed, and she looked very pale.
Her other daughter worked at the hospital and was waiting with a wheelchair when they arrived. The daughters made sure that the doctors and nurses knew that their mother took two medications to keep her immune system from killing her transplanted kidney. Because of those immune-suppressing drugs, she’d had many infections over the years. Six months earlier, she nearly lost her kidney to a particularly aggressive bacterium. She’d been well since then, until a few days earlier when she came down with a cold. It was just a sore throat and a runny nose, but the couple were worried enough to move her into their home to keep an eye on her. She didn’t want to eat because of the pain in her throat, but otherwise she seemed to be doing well.
A Possible Urinary-Tract InfectionThe exam in the emergency room was mostly unremarkable, though she was a little confused at times. Her kidneys were no worse than usual. Her chest X-ray was fine; there was no sign of pneumonia. The CT scan of her head was normal and provided no explanation for her seizure. Studies of her urine showed what might be an infection. And the woman’s white-blood-cell count, which would usually be sky-high if she had an infection, was instead dangerously low. There was no obvious cause of the low white-blood-cell count or the earlier seizure and current confusion. She was admitted to the hospital and started on intravenous antibiotics for a presumed urinary-tract infection.
The admitting team searched for the cause of the seizure. An M.R.I. of the brain showed nothing beyond normal age-related changes. A spinal tap showed no evidence of either a viral or a bacterial invader. After two days, the patient spiked a fever despite the antibiotics, and the team reached out to the infectious-disease doctors.
A Cough SurfacesIt was early afternoon by the time Dr. Thomas Holowka, a resident in his second year of training, went to see the patient. The woman’s answers were slow and uncertain. Did she have any pain when she urinated? Was she going more often than usual? For patients with bacteria in their urine, these are standard questions to determine whether those bacteria indicate a harmful infection or are peaceful residents of the microbiome. She had no pain, she told the young doctor, but she was peeing every time she coughed. And she was coughing a lot.
How long has that been going on? the resident asked. A while, the patient answered vaguely. When he examined her, the doctor noticed that she was tender over her right flank — the site of her transplant years before. The tenderness suggested an infection in that kidney. If so, she was on the right antibiotics. But that infection didn’t explain the seizure — or the cough.
Because she was immune-compromised, the resident was worried that the patient could have an infection in her respiratory tract as well. He recommended that the team get a CT scan of her lungs and blood tests to look for infections that are more commonly seen in patients who are immune-compromised. She’d been tested for the usual respiratory viruses. Should she be tested for the new coronavirus? At that time, March 13, there had been no cases of SARS-CoV-2 at Yale New Haven Hospital. There had been a couple of dozen cases of Covid-19 in Connecticut, but all of them were linked to a dinner party held in Westport, halfway across the state. It seemed unlikely, but Holowka decided to order it. And so that afternoon the patient was transferred to the floor set aside for hospitalized patients being tested for Covid-19.
Probably Not, But MaybeDr. Lydia Barakat, the infectious-disease specialist taking care of the patients on the Covid floor, thought the test might be overkill. The patient had the mildest cough and had experienced only a single fever spike since the antibiotics were started. She thought it very unlikely that the patient would test positive. But the family was worried, and Barakat understood why. This older woman was the kind of patient who would be particularly vulnerable if she got the virus.
The patient recalls clearly how unpleasant the test for the respiratory virus was. “I didn’t expect someone to go up my nose like that,” she told me. “I mean, wow!” The result came back just a few hours later. She was positive for Covid-19 — the second case, it would turn out, to be diagnosed that night in the hospital.
Her course was complicated. She got very sick. She stayed in the hospital a full month. She was given antimalarials, antibiotics and finally an anti-inflammatory, immune-suppressing medication. Slowly she recovered, and finally she went home.
What We Know NowThis patient came to the hospital early in our understanding of Covid-19. Now we know that this virus, like many viruses, causes the number of disease-fighting white blood cells to drop; it’s still not clear why. We also know that neurological symptoms, like headaches or the loss of sense of taste or smell, are common in Covid-19. And that seizures and confusion, while rarer, have been reported — in Wuhan and in Europe. Indeed, Barakat tells me that she and her colleagues have noticed that in older patients, neurological problems including confusion, falls and weakness may be some of the most frequent early symptoms of Covid-19.
Our knowledge of this illness — or any illness — is shaped by what we learn from patients who have the disease. With Covid-19, our inadequate supply of tests means that we’ve limited our use of them to patients who have what we already expect to see. This woman was tested only when she developed a classic sign of the infection. Yet her positive test taught her doctors something new about this disease — that it could cause seizures and confusion.
Should we test everyone who comes into the hospital? Perhaps we would learn more quickly about the symptoms of this illness. Moreover, because this patient was in the hospital for three days before being tested, dozens of health care workers and other front-line personnel were exposed.
No medical center is testing everyone right now. In New York City, all pregnant women who come into the NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital system to give birth are automatically checked for Covid. Of 210 asymptomatic women tested on admission to labor and delivery in the first two weeks of the program, 29, or nearly 14 percent, were found to have Covid-19. Early identification of these cases allowed the hospital to use their precious personal protective equipment (P.P.E.) where it was most needed. Of course, no test is 100 percent accurate, and these particular tests, experts estimate, have a false negative rate as high as 30 percent. Trusting our gut, however, or what we think we know about this new disease, has already shown us how wrong we can be.
Update April 30, 2020: After this article went to press, Yale New Haven Hospital said all patients admitted to the hospital through the emergency room would be tested for Covid-19."

When diagnosing the ills afflicting modern science, an entertainment that, along with the disparagement of his critics and fellow researchers, he counts among his great delights, the eminent French microbiologist Didier Raoult will lightly stroke his beard, lean back in his seat and, with a thin but unmistakable smile, declare the poor patient to be stricken with pride. Raoult, who has achieved international fame since his proposed treatment for Covid-19 was touted as a miracle cure by President Trump, believes that his colleagues fail to see that their ideas are the products of mere intellectual fashions — that they are hypnotized by methodology into believing that they understand what they do not and that they lack the discipline of mind that would permit them to comprehend their error. “Hubris,” Raoult told me recently, at his institute in Marseille, “is the most common thing in the world.” It is a particularly dangerous malady in doctors like him, whose opinions are freighted with the responsibility of life and death. “Someone who doesn’t know is less stupid than someone who wrongly thinks he does,” he said. “Because it is a terrible thing to be wrong.”
Raoult, who founded and directs the research hospital known as the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire Méditerranée Infection, or IHU, has made a great career assailing orthodoxy, in both word and practice. “There’s nothing I like more than blowing up a theory that’s been so nicely established,” he once said. He has a reputation for bluster but also for a certain creativity. He looks where no one else cares to, with methods no one else is using, and finds things. In just the past 10 years, he has helped identify nearly 500 novel species of human-borne bacteria, about one-fifth of all those named and described. Until recently, he was perhaps best known as the discoverer of the first giant virus, a microbe that, in his opinion, suggests that viruses ought to be considered a fourth and separate domain of living things. The discovery helped win him the Grand Prix Inserm, one of France’s top scientific prizes. It also led him to believe that the tree of life suggested by Darwinian evolution is “entirely false,” he told me, and that Darwin himself “wrote nothing but inanities.” He detests consensus and comity; he believes that science, and life, ought to be a fight.
It is in this spirit that, over the objections of his peers, and no doubt because of them, too, he has promoted a combination of hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, and azithromycin, a common antibiotic, as a remedy for Covid-19. He has taken to declaring, “We know how to cure the disease.” Trump was not the only one eager to embrace this possibility. By the time I arrived in Marseille, some version of Raoult’s treatment regimen had been authorized for testing or use in France, Italy, China, India and numerous other countries. One in every five registered drug trials in the world was testing hydroxychloroquine.
In March, Raoult announced that his hospital would test and treat anyone who cared to show up. Crowds gathered at the entrance to the IHU in winding single-file lines, like pilgrims shuffling toward their private audience with the oracle. On March 16, Raoult released the results of a small clinical trial that showed, he said, a 100 percent cure rate. The study has since been widely debated, and Raoult’s boosterism has been lamented by scientists and health officials around the world; in a comment more or less representative of the tenor of the controversy in France, where Raoult’s name and image have now been everywhere for weeks, one detractor, a generally thoughtful politician, suggested that Raoult “shut his face and be a doctor” and that he “stop saying ‘I’m a genius’ all over the place.”
His colleagues liken his psychology to that of Napoleon, though he is not physically small. When asked by one journalist about his tendency to “swim against the current” of scientific thought, Raoult responded: “I’m not an ‘outsider.’ I’m the one who’s farthest out in front.” Axel Kahn, a geneticist and physician who has known Raoult for nearly 40 years, told me that he has always been this way. “One of Professor Raoult’s abiding characteristics is that he knows that he’s very good,” Kahn told me. “But he considers everyone else to be worthless. And he always has. It’s not a recent development.” At his home, alongside a collection of Roman busts, he is said to keep a marble statue of himself.
Raoult, who is 68, is a sturdily built but fine-featured man, with high cheekbones and a tight, contemptuous mouth. In recent years, he has hidden these behind a straggly white mustache and goatee and has grown his flaxen hair down to his shoulders. On his right pinkie he now wears a silver skull. In internet memes, he has been depicted as the wizard Gandalf and as a druid; except for his white lab coat, he has the general aspect of a fortuneteller who rides a Harley to work. The French journalist Hervé Vaudoit, who has written admiringly about Raoult over the years, once asked him why he’d taken to dressing this way. Raoult replied, “Because it pisses them off.”
In the weeks since SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, spread throughout the world, his disdain for respectable opinion, and for the “Parisian marquesses” who are its representatives, has endeared him to a large segment of the French population. According to one survey, by late March, Raoult had become one of France’s most popular “political personalities,” with particular appeal on the populist extremes. Votives bearing his image were being sold in Marseille, and on some evenings, at 8 p.m., a battalion of municipal garbage trucks assembled on the roadway outside his hospital, where the drivers leaned on their horns in loud and furious tribute. A hundred-foot banner, painted by a club of local soccer fans and strung up near the entrance, read, “Marseille and the world behind Prof. Raoult!!!”
Raoult has been collecting the merchandise created by his fans, and he seems to be enjoying his fame, though he claims otherwise. He is certain the drugs will vindicate him in the end; everything else is a matter of appearances. “I really do think we’re in a theater,” he told me. “In my play, the people who judge me as a doctor are my patients. As a scientist, it’s my colleagues. And time.”
A few weeks ago, I spoke, from the recommended distance, to a man named Jacques Cohen. He was seated on the sidewalk outside the IHU, an angular monument of concrete and glass about a mile and a half from Marseille’s old port. Cohen had his back against a pylon and his wrists on his knees, at the edge of a group of perhaps 60 people. By their unworried proximity to one another — they were standing around in a loose group, as people used to, waiting to enter the hospital through a side door — they were identifiable as the unfortunates who already knew they were positive. I had selected Cohen as my interlocutor under the guidance of a nearby nurse. He was not coughing or sneezing; he wore a mask. “In any case, we’re all going to get it,” the nurse said.
I crouched on the pavement and asked Cohen, who is 76, how he was feeling. For the past two days, he had been taking hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. “It’s getting better,” Cohen said through his mask. He looked ashen but optimistic. His fever had fallen, and he had begun to regain his sense of taste. I noted that there was some debate about the efficacy of the treatment. “There’s no ‘believing’ or ‘not believing,’” Cohen replied. “We know it’s effective!”
Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are well characterized, well tolerated and widely prescribed medications. Azithromycin was developed 40 years ago in the former Yugoslavia and is today the second-most commonly prescribed antibiotic in the United States. Hydroxychloroquine, along with its more toxic analog chloroquine, was for several decades the most commonly prescribed antimalarial drug in the world. Today it is widely used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. All three molecules are included on the World Health Organization’s Model List of Essential Medicines, a compilation of “the most efficacious, safe and cost-effective medicines for priority conditions.”
Raoult knows the drugs well. From the start of his career, he has experimented extensively with drug repositioning, in which medicines that have been approved for use against one disease are repurposed as treatments for others. Hundreds and hundreds of molecules have already been approved for human use by the Food and Drug Administration. Hidden among these, Raoult contends, are various unanticipated cures. “You test everything,” Raoult told me. “You stop pondering; you just look and see if, by chance, something works. And what you find by chance, it’ll knock you on your derrière.” Antidepressants and antihypertensives have been shown to have antiviral properties; lovastatin, which is prescribed to lower cholesterol levels, has been found to be effective, at least in mice, against plague. In a 2018 paper, Raoult and a team of researchers reported that azithromycin showed strong activity in cells infected with the Zika virus.
Raoult spent the first decade of his life in Dakar, in what was then French Senegal, where his father, a military doctor, was posted. To ward off malaria, he was given chloroquine. “I took it all the time when I was a kid,” he told me. In the 1990s, in an early repurposing experiment, he tested the effect of hydroxychloroquine on a frequently fatal condition known as Q fever, which is caused by an intracellular bacterium. Like viruses, intracellular bacteria multiply within the cells of their hosts; Raoult found that hydroxychloroquine, by reducing acidity within the host cells, slowed bacterial growth. He began treating Q fever with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and doxycycline and later used the same drugs for Whipple’s disease, another fatal condition caused by an intracellular bacterium. The combination is now considered to be a standard treatment for both diseases.
Given the similarities between intracellular bacteria and viruses, Raoult suspected that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might have antiviral effects. Following the SARS outbreak in 2002, researchers found that chloroquine slowed reproduction of the SARS coronavirus in cell cultures. Raoult reviewed that evidence in a 2007 paper, concluding that chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine might be “an interesting weapon to face present and future infectious diseases worldwide.” This winter, as the spread of SARS-CoV-2 began to take on the contours of a pandemic, he surveyed the data that had begun coming out of China. An early report on chloroquine showed good results in vitro. In mid-February, another Chinese team reported that, in more than 100 patients, it had been found to have “potent activity against Covid-19.” Raoult was elated.
At the time, health authorities around the world were warning that a viable treatment could be months away. The Chinese reports, however, appeared to confirm Raoult’s longstanding hopes for chloroquine. A deadly virus for which no treatment existed could evidently be stopped by an inexpensive, widely studied, pre-existing molecule, and one that Raoult knew well. A more heedful scientist might have surveyed the Chinese data and begun preparations for tests of his own. Raoult did this, but he also posted a brief, jubilant video on YouTube, under the title “Coronavirus: Game Over!” Chloroquine had produced what he called “spectacular improvements” in the Chinese patients. “It’s excellent news — this is probably the easiest respiratory infection to treat of all,” Raoult said. “The only thing I’ll tell you is, be careful: Soon the pharmacies won’t have any chloroquine left!”
Raoult has spent nearly his entire life in Marseille, a famously ragged and combative city, which he loves. He named a genus of bacteria, Massilia, for it and has given its name or the names of its neighborhoods to numerous other species of microbe. Marseille has been a major port for more than 2,000 years and has a correspondingly rich history of disease. It was the point of entry into France for all three of the great waves of bubonic plague, beginning in the sixth century. Between 1720 and 1722, the plague killed about half of Marseille’s population; one of its central neighborhoods, on the old port, is today named for the bishop who tended to the ill while the city’s doctors hid in fear.
Raoult wrote his first research paper, in 1979, on a tick-borne infection sometimes known as Marseille fever. The disease was also called “benign summer fever,” and more than 50 years of science said it was nonlethal. And yet one of the 41 patients in his data set had died. Before submitting the paper, Raoult, who was then a young resident, gave it to a supervising professor for review. “And he takes it,” Raoult told me, “he doesn’t show it to me again, and he publishes it — and he’d taken out the death. Because he didn’t know how to make sense of the death.” Raoult was disgusted, and the incident shaped his philosophy of scientific inquiry. “I learned that the people who wanted to follow the familiar path were prepared to cheat in order to do it,” he said. In subsequent work, he demonstrated that Marseille fever was indeed fatal in almost precisely one in every 41 cases. “He was a ‘follower,’” Raoult said of the professor. “And these ‘followers’ are all cheaters. That’s what I thought. And it’s still what I think.”
He is, fundamentally, a contrarian. In Raoult’s view, little of consequence has been accomplished by researchers who endorse the habitual tools and theories of their age. “I’ve spent my life being ‘against,’” he told me. “I tell young scientists: ‘You know, you don’t need a brain to agree. All you need is a spinal cord.’” He is thrilled by conflict. It is a matter both of philosophy — the influence, no doubt, of the thinker he refers to admiringly as “master Nietzsche” — and of temperament. “He loves to know that things are roiling around him,” one of his lab technicians told me; he sets off storms and admires them as they roll out over the land. His peers shake their heads at this behavior but grant him a grudging respect. “You can’t knock him down,” said Mark Pallen, a professor of microbial genomics at the University of East Anglia. “In terms of his place in the canon, the sainthood of science, he’s pretty secure there.”
He is also interested in power and has been attentive to it from the start. In 1985 and 1986, Raoult worked at the Naval Medical Research Institute in Bethesda, Md., where he discovered the Science Citation Index. The index, a tool that can be used to measure a scientist’s influence on the basis of his or her publication history, was relatively unknown in France. Raoult looked up the researchers reputed to be the best in Marseille. “It was really the emperor wears no clothes,” he said. “These people didn’t publish. There was one who hadn’t written a paper in 10 years.” In Raoult’s view, French science was a duchy of appearances, connections and self-reverence. “It was people saying” — he mimed the drone of an aristocrat — “ ‘Oh, him, yes, he’s very good.’ And this reputation, you don’t know what it’s based on, but it’s not the truth.”
For decades, Raoult has boasted of his prodigious rates of publication and citation, which, as objective statistics, he considers to be the best measure of his worth as a researcher. Biomedical researchers in France write or contribute to perhaps 10 scientific papers every year and a few hundred in the course of a career. Raoult’s name sits atop several thousand; in each of the past eight years, he has produced more than 100. In 2020, he has already published at least 54.
Raoult is reputed to be an indefatigable worker, but he also achieves his extreme rate of publication by attaching his name to nearly every paper that comes out of his institute. Though the practice is not unheard-of, it is unusual. “Even to just read those papers would take up a large percentage of anyone’s time,” Pallen told me. “For someone like me to actually go through them carefully, critique them, make a substantial intellectual contribution — I think that would be practically impossible.”
With few exceptions, the department heads at the IHU have worked under Raoult for their entire careers, some for more than 30 years. It is an “ancestral system,” “familial” and “clanlike,” said Michel Drancourt, a clinician who is Raoult’s longest-serving collaborator. Raoult is, without question, the patriarch, and he is in some respects reputed to be benevolent. The IHU spends a great deal of money on scholarships and research grants for students from the developing world, for instance, and Raoult is known to be accessible to young researchers in a way that distinguishes him from other high-powered scientists. He is also known for berating his subordinates. While visiting the IHU, I watched a young researcher emerge from Raoult’s office in tears and rush into the arms of her friends, who were evidently accustomed to this. “When he’s not happy about something, he’ll let you know,” one of them told me. A 2017 employee letter of complaint, which was followed by an investigation of the IHU, described the “screaming,” “insults” and “psychological bullying” of a “leadership of another era.” Along the entryway to Raoult’s institute, there’s a line from Horace: Exegi monumentum aere perennius, “I have crafted a monument more lasting than bronze.”
In recent years, Raoult has amused himself, it seems, by staking out tendentious scientific claims, sometimes in territories that are well beyond the scope of his expertise. He is skeptical, for instance, of the utility of mathematical modeling in the realm of epidemiology. The same logic has led him to conclude that climate modelers are no more than “soothsayers” for our “scientistic era” and that their dire predictions are mostly just an attempt to expiate our intense but irrational feelings of guilt.
He is also dismissive of the alarmism that is the default position among specialists of infectious disease. He doubted, initially, that SARS-CoV-2 would spread beyond China, or that it might be a terrible problem if it did. On Jan. 20, Chinese scientists confirmed that infections were being transmitted from patient to patient, and President Xi Jinping, in his first public comments about the coronavirus, declared that all possible measures would have to be taken to contain the outbreak. The World Health Organization announced an emergency meeting. The following day, in Marseille, Raoult posted a video to his institute’s YouTube channel. He faced his offscreen interviewer with weary eyes, sighed and said, “You know, the world has gone crazy.” Every year, he said, there are probably 600 or 700 people who die from coronavirus infections in France and thousands more from other respiratory illnesses. “The fact that people have died from a coronavirus in China, I don’t feel like it means much of anything for me,” he said. “I don’t know, maybe people don’t have anything to do, so they’ve gone looking in China for something to be scared about.”
Raoult’s most recent book, “Epidemics: Real Dangers and False Alerts,” was published in late March, by which time the W.H.O. had reported more than 330,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 worldwide and more than 14,500 deaths. “This anguish over epidemics,” he writes, “is completely untethered from the reality of deaths from infectious diseases.”
By the standards of molecular biology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, the technology most commonly used to test for SARS-CoV-2, is not extravagantly complex. But it depends upon collection swabs, thermocycling machines, chemical reagents and nucleotide probes and primers, and if any one of these components is in insufficient supply, the tests cannot be run. Beginning in January, when the SARS-CoV-2 genome was first published, the IHU bought or borrowed as much of all these as possible, spending a half million euros on new machines alone. Whatever Raoult’s reservations about the virus, he did not intend to miss the opportunity to study it, and perhaps to win the race to find a treatment. His institute receives most of its funding from public sources — Raoult was given 130 million euros to build it — but it effectively controls its own budget, and Raoult, as the founding director, has near-complete control of what goes on inside its walls. “He can essentially say, ‘Hold on, I want to turn the bedroom and the dining room into a kitchen,’” Drancourt said.
Nearly 800 people work at the institute. In early March, as coronavirus patients began arriving, almost all the staff members turned their efforts to SARS-CoV-2. Raoult obtained authorization to begin a small clinical trial of hydroxychloroquine. Because viral respiratory infections often lead to secondary bacterial infections, however, Raoult wanted to test a supplementary antibiotic in some patients; he chose azithromycin, which he had previously tested against Zika. “If you’re going to choose one, you might as well choose one that’s been shown to be active against a virus,” said Bernard La Scola, who runs the biosafety lab at the IHU.
Hydroxychloroquine is believed to inhibit viral reproduction in infected cells by raising their pH, as in Q fever and Whipple’s disease; the antiviral mechanism of azithromycin has not been explained. But what works works. If we relied only upon medications with precisely established mechanisms, a number of popular drugs — acetaminophen, for instance, the active ingredient in Tylenol — would not be in use. I asked Raoult if the idea to test the drugs together had emerged from discussions with his team. “It was me,” he told me. “Don’t kid yourself.”
Testing had been scheduled to run for two weeks per patient, but after only six days, the results were so favorable that Raoult decided to end the trial and publish. “Usually, we’d take time to write, to make corrections, to consider, to go over things 50 times,” said Philippe Gautret, the department head who was the first listed author on the paper. “In this case, we were working with a sense of real urgency. Because we thought we had to get the word out, because, maybe, we’d found a way to make things better.”
Others might have proceeded with more caution or perhaps waited to confirm these results with a larger, more rigorous trial. Raoult likes to think of himself as a doctor first, however, with a moral obligation to treat his patients that supersedes any desire to produce reliable data. “We’re not going to tell someone, ‘Listen, today’s not your lucky day, you’re getting the placebo, you’re going to be dying,’” he told me. He believes it to be unnecessary, in addition to being unethical, to run randomized controlled trials, or R.C.T.s, of treatments for deadly infectious diseases. If these have become the accepted standard in biomedical research, Raoult contends, it is only because they appeal to statisticians “who have never seen a patient.” He refers to these scientists disdainfully as “methodologists.”
Raoult’s paper included results for 36 patients. Fourteen were treated with hydroxychloroquine sulfate; six were treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and azithromycin; and 16 served as controls. On Day 6 of the trial, 14 of the 16 control patients still tested positive for the virus. Patients receiving hydroxychloroquine fared markedly better, with only six of 14 testing positive on Day 6. Most encouraging, though, all six patients treated with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were found to be rid of the virus.
Several prominent French doctors cautioned that the results would have to be confirmed and warned of possible side effects. The French health minister deemed the trial promising but called for more testing. Raoult had already begun assembling data for a larger study, but he dismissed the need for anything particularly vast or lengthy. Like other critics of the R.C.T., he likes to point out that a number of self-evidently useful developments in the realm of human health have never been validated by such rigorous tests. This observation has come to be known as the parachute paradigm: We tend to accept the claim that parachutes reduce injury among people who leap from airplanes, but this effect has never been proved in a randomized study that compares an experimental parachute group to an unlucky parachuteless control. “It’s like Didier says,” Drancourt told me. “If you don’t have something that’s visible in 10 patients, or 30, it’s useless. It’s not of any consequence.” An effective treatment for a potentially lethal infectious disease will be visible to the naked eye.
On March 16, a Long Island attorney and blockchain enthusiast named Gregory Rigano appeared on Laura Ingraham’s nightly show on Fox News, “The Ingraham Angle.” Ingraham introduced the segment by asking: “What if there’s already a cheap and widely available medication, that’s on the market, to treat the virus? Well, according to a new study, there is such a drug. It’s called chloroquine.” Rigano, who at the time was falsely presenting himself as an adviser to Stanford Medical School, had recently self-published an acclamatory report on the potential of chloroquine, “An Effective Treatment for Coronavirus (Covid-19),” as a Google Doc formatted to resemble a scientific publication. It had begun to circulate in right-wing media and also in Silicon Valley; Elon Musk tweeted a link to it. Raoult saw it and noticed the attention it was receiving online. Another researcher might have found this sort of publication irresponsible and dangerous. Raoult began corresponding with Rigano and his co-author, James Todaro, an ophthalmologist and Bitcoin investor. Raoult authorized them to share his results before they had been published.
On air, Rigano announced that a researcher in the south of France, “one of the most eminent infectious-disease specialists in the whole world,” was about to publish the results of a major clinical study. “Within a matter of six days, the patients taking hydroxychloroquine tested negative for coronavirus, for Covid-19,” Rigano said. (He made no mention of azithromycin.) “We have a strong reason to believe that a preventative dose of hydroxychloroquine is going to prevent the virus from attaching to the body, and just get rid of it completely,” he added. “That’s a game changer,” Ingraham said.
In the coming days, Ingraham questioned both Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of President Trump’s pandemic task force, and Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, about the drug. Sean Hannity began promoting it as a cure for Covid-19. “Let’s put it this way,” he said on his radio show. “If I had it — personally, I am speaking only for Sean Hannity — I would be all over this.” Rigano appeared on Tucker Carlson’s show and claimed that Raoult’s study had shown hydroxychloroquine to have a “100 percent cure rate against coronavirus.” According to Todaro, Raoult had sent him a copy of his study and allowed him to post it on Twitter that day, two days before the preprint release. “I suspect he gave us permission because he knew it was the fastest way to disseminate the trial results,” Todaro told me. (Rigano did not respond to requests for comment.) Later, Raoult himself appeared on “Dr. Oz,” the talk show hosted by the celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, a frequent Fox News guest who has promoted hydroxychloroquine. “I believe that ideas and theories are epidemic,” Raoult once wrote. “When they’re good, they take root.”
Trump began hyping hydroxychloroquine on March 19, at a White House news conference with his coronavirus task force. “I think it’s going to be very exciting,” Trump said. “I think it could be a game changer and maybe not. And maybe not. But I think it could be, based on what I see, it could be a game changer. Very powerful.” He suggested, inaccurately, that the F.D.A. had approved the drug for use against Covid-19. He made no mention of azithromycin. Commissioner Stephen M. Hahn of the F.D.A. gently corrected him later and said that a large clinical trial would be the appropriate way to evaluate the therapeutic value of the drug.
Still, because chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are available for use in other conditions, doctors were able to provide Covid-19 patients with “off-label” treatment if they believed it would provide a benefit. Shortages of the drugs were reported beginning in mid-March. The F.D.A., under what appears to have been strong pressure from the Trump administration, issued an emergency-use authorization for chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate, giving doctors access to tens of millions of doses of the drugs from the Strategic National Stockpile. Unusually, the C.D.C., at what was reportedly Trump’s direct urging, issued Covid-19 prescription guidelines for the drugs based upon unattributed clinical anecdotes. (The guidelines were later withdrawn.) A top government biomedical official was removed from his post, he has claimed, for having resisted political pressure to fund “potentially dangerous drugs,” including hydroxychloroquine.
There is much about Raoult that might make him, and by extension his proposed treatment, appealing to a man like Trump. He is an iconoclast with funny hair; he thinks almost everyone else is stupid, especially those who are typically regarded as smart; he is beloved by the angry and conspiracy-minded; his self-congratulation is more or less unceasing. Raoult and I spoke several days after the emergency-use authorization was signed. He said he hadn’t heard about it and seemed surprised, but he also said that Trump had impressed him with his intuition on hydroxychloroquine. “He’s not so dumb,” he said, laughing. Raoult classified Trump’s psychology as that of an “entrepreneur,” by way of contrast with that of a “politician.” “Entrepreneurs are people who know how to decide, who know how to take risks,” he said. “And at a certain point, to decide is to take a risk. Every decision is a risk.”
The French waited far too long, in his estimation, to approve the use of hydroxychloroquine in Covid-19 patients. The authorization came only after Raoult announced in the press that he would continue, “in accordance with the Hippocratic oath” and effectively in defiance of the government, to treat patients with his combination therapy. “I’m convinced that in the end, everyone will be using this treatment,” Raoult told Le Parisien. “It’s just a matter of time before people agree to eat their hats.”
The dynamics of a crisis are not especially conducive to reliable science. In October 1985, in the terrible early years of the AIDS epidemic, a group of French doctors, joined by the French minister of social affairs, held a news conference to announce to the world that they had discovered what looked like a cure. The drug was cyclosporine, an inexpensive immunosuppressant that had until then been used in organ transplants to prevent the rejection of new tissue. In AIDS patients, cyclosporine had the paradoxical effect of increasing white-blood-cell counts; patients underwent a “spectacular improvement,” one researcher said. The announcement was based upon results from only two patients, however, and these patients had begun treatment only one week earlier. The scientists were widely criticized at the time for flouting the norms of biomedical research to report such limited data. “Given the strength of our hypotheses,” they responded, “we believe that, ethically, we could not continue to keep our results a secret just to respect the usual laws of scientific conduct.”
“Like Raoult, they felt very strongly about what they said,” said Jean-Michel Molina, who directs the infectious-disease departments at two public hospitals in Paris. “They felt that they had found a cure.” Shortly after the announcement, one of the two patients died, and it was revealed that a third patient had died before the news conference; he had been excluded from the reported results because his case was considered too grave to reverse. Within weeks, the remaining patient’s white-blood-cell count had fallen to its previous level. Experimentation with cyclosporine soon stopped.
Like many doctors, Molina viewed Raoult’s study with skepticism, but he was also curious to see if his proposed treatment regimen might in fact work. He tested hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin in 11 of his own patients. “We had severe patients, and we wanted to try something,” Molina told me. Within five days, one had died, and two others had been transferred out of his service to intensive care. In another patient, the treatment was suspended after the onset of cardiac issues, a known side effect of the drugs. Eight of the 10 surviving patients still tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the conclusion of the study period. Raoult’s data had come from patients with mild or early cases of the disease, when viral loads are lower, and I asked Molina if his patients had not been too sick to benefit from the treatment. “If there is antiviral activity, you should be able to see it,” he said. “You know, you may say, ‘It’s too late, you’re not going to see the clinical benefit.’ But at least you should see the antiviral activity. If it’s an antiviral.”
Raoult’s study had measured only viral load. It offered no data on clinical outcomes, and it was not clear if the patients’ actual symptoms had improved or indeed whether the patients lived or died. At the outset, 26 patients were assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine, six more than the 20 who appeared in the final results. The six additional patients had been “lost in follow-up,” the authors wrote, “because of early cessation of treatment.” The reasons given were concerning. One patient stopped taking the drug after developing nausea. Three patients had to be transferred out of the institute to intensive care. One patient died. (Another patient elected to leave the hospital before the end of the treatment cycle.) “So four of the 26 treated patients were actually not recovering at all,” noted Elisabeth Bik, a scientific consultant who wrote a widely circulated blog post on Raoult’s study. She paraphrased the sarcasm circulating on Twitter: “My results always look amazing if I leave out the patients who died.”
The report was also riddled with discrepancies and apparent errors. Its selection criteria called for participants above the age of 12, but three of the control subjects were younger than this. The control patients were drawn not only from the IHU but also from hospitals in two other cities, where the standard of care and the testing protocols may have differed. Fourteen of 16 control patients were reported to have tested positive for the virus at the conclusion of the study on Day 6. In fact, according to the initial report, for five of those 14, no data was collected that day. One of the six patients who received hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin and was recorded as “virologically cured” at Day 6 was found, in the end, to be carrying the virus two days later.
This apparent sloppiness was unsurprising to many of those who have tracked Raoult’s work in the past. A prominent French microbiologist told me that, in terms of publication, Raoult’s reputation among scientists has been “long gone” for some time. “In private,” the researcher wrote to me, “everybody agrees on the low reliability/reproducibility of most of the papers coming out of his lab.” (He asked to speak anonymously so as not to anger Raoult, whom he knows.) In 2018, after damning evaluations, Raoult’s principal laboratory groups were stripped of their association with two of France’s top public research institutions. Raoult was found to have produced an extraordinary number of publications but few of great quality. “It’s very easy to publish [expletive] when you know how publishing works,” said Karine Lacombe, a professor of medicine in Paris who has recently been among Raoult’s more outspoken critics.
Beyond its apparent errors and omissions, the study’s design — its small size, its flawed control, the unrandomized assignment of patients to the treatment and control groups — was widely viewed to render its results meaningless. Fauci repeatedly called its results “anecdotal”; the biostatistician who analyzed the paper on behalf of the French government’s coronavirus advisory committee wrote that it was “impossible to interpret the effect described therein as being attributable to treatment with hydroxychloroquine.”
Large, well-controlled randomized trials are by no means the only way to arrive at useful scientific insights. Their utility is that they enhance statistical signals such that, amid the noise of human variability and random chance, even the faint effect of some new treatment can be detected. The prime statistical hurdle that any proposed treatment for Covid-19 will have to overcome — one that is delicate for even Raoult’s critics to make note of, amid the sorrow and fear of this pandemic — is that the signal is likely to be very faint, because the disease is, in the end, rarely fatal. Nearly everyone survives; an effective treatment will save the life of the one or so patients in every hundred who would not have lived without it. “You know, people sometimes say, ‘If the patient gets better, that’s because of the drug, and if they get worse, it’s because of the virus,’” Molina told me. “And of course that’s not true. And that’s why you need to do a well-conducted, randomized, placebo-controlled study if you want to show anything.” It is possible that hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are an effective treatment for Covid-19. But Raoult’s study showed, at best, that 20 people who would almost certainly have survived without any treatment at all also survived for six days while taking the drugs Raoult prescribed.
“If you haven’t done this stuff, you can look at a report of people responding to such a treatment and ﬁgure that the answer is here — right here, and anyone who doesn’t see it must have some ulterior motives,” Derek Lowe, a longtime pharmaceutical researcher, wrote for Science Translational Medicine last month. “But that’s not how it works.” He went on: “Alzheimer’s drugs, obesity drugs, cardiovascular drugs, osteoporosis drugs: Over and over, there have been what looked like positive results that evaporated on closer inspection. After you’ve experienced this a few times, you take the lesson to heart that the only way to be sure about these things is to run sufﬁciently powered controlled trials. No shortcuts, no gut feelings — just data.”
“I’ve invented 10 or so treatments in my life,” Raoult told me. “Half of them are prescribed all over the world. I’ve never done a double-blind study in my life, never. Never! Never done anything randomized, either.” He noted, with some satisfaction, that the criticism was more intense than he had anticipated. “Honestly, I couldn’t have imagined that it would set off a frenzy like this,” he said, leaning back in his office chair and gesturing at the storm he had created in the world outside. “When you tell the story, it’s extremely straightforward, no? It’s subject, verb, complement: You detect a disease; there’s a drug that’s cheap, whose safety we know all about because there’s two billion people who take it; we prescribe it, and it changes what it changes. It might not be a miracle product, but it’s better than doing nothing, no?”
His subordinates defended the study as the best work they could do under the circumstances and the fastest way to alert the world to the possibility of a treatment. The use of off-site controls was not ideal, for example, but it was the only option if they wanted to move fast. “Of course it’s a methodological weakness,” Gautret, the first author, told me. “But we made do with what we had.” As for the six patients “lost in follow-up,” even if it had been possible to collect data from them, it would have been nonsensical to include most of them in their report. Their aim was “to treat people in the early stages of the disease, when it’s not yet serious,” Gautret said. “We know that in acute viral diseases, the earlier you treat, the better your chances of success. It makes no sense to include people who are at the edge of death in the study. We’re not claiming to be able to treat people who are nearly dead.” Another small study, in 80 patients, likewise showed better results for patients with mild forms of the disease.
In Marseille, Raoult told me he would be releasing a third study, this one of 1,000 patients, the following week. Initial results were published in mid-April. Raoult had treated 1,061 patients with a combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. The study was neither controlled nor randomized; at the time of the preprint release, eight patients had died, and five remained hospitalized, while 46 in total experienced a “poor clinical outcome.” The findings were summarized as “98.7 percent of patients cured so far.” The therapy constituted a “safe and efficient treatment for Covid-19,” the authors wrote.
Other scientists disagreed with this characterization of the results. “The cure rate is almost identical to what’s been described about the natural course of the disease,” the virologist Christine Rouzioux told French radio. Lacombe called Raoult’s conclusions “magical thinking,” adding: “I very honestly think he hasn’t shown anything at all.” It was soon discovered, too, that the second and third studies had been conducted without approval from a state ethics board. In an initial version of the third paper, Raoult wrote that he had conducted a “retrospective study on a cohort of patients receiving standard treatment following a research protocol previously registered.” He provided a reference to the protocol that had been approved for the first trial. But that protocol included hydroxychloroquine alone and not azithromycin; Raoult never received approval to systematically test a combination of the drugs.
The French medical regulatory agency, the A.N.S.M., sent Raoult a request for evidence of the second study’s “legal status” in mid-April. Later in the month, the French Medical Council issued a statement, widely assumed to be directed at Raoult, reminding its members that “the endangerment of patients” by exposure to “treatments that have not been scientifically validated” could be cause for immediate suspension. Raoult responded on Twitter, where he now has a half million followers, that the council’s threat was “obviously” not applicable to his case. In a statement on the A.N.S.M.’s inquiry, the IHU insisted that the study did not involve experimentation because “no procedure beyond the standard of care” — which, at the IHU, was hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin — had been employed.
Raoult had by then begun to lose his composure. He accused Lacombe of being a shill for the pharmaceutical industry; his fans sent her death threats. On Twitter, he called Bik, the consultant who wrote critically about the first study, a “witch hunter” and called a study that she tweeted — one of several published in April and May that seemed to suggest that Raoult’s treatment regimen was ineffectual or even harmful — “fake news.” The authors of another such study were accused of “scientific fraud.” “My detractors are children!” Raoult told an interviewer. The world’s attention has drifted to new studies of other drugs; Raoult has taken to attacking those studies for their methodological weaknesses.
The results of his initial trial have yet to be replicated. “I think what he secretly hopes is that no one will ever be able to show anything,” Molina told me. “That all the trials conducted on hydroxychloroquine will not be able to even reach a conclusion of no efficacy.” In recent weeks, Raoult has in fact tempered his claims about the virtues of his treatment regimen. The published, peer-reviewed version of the final study noted that another two patients had died, bringing the total to 10. Where the earlier version called the drugs “safe and efficient,” they were now described merely as “safe.”
He has shown flickers of what appears to be doubt. In one interview, Raoult quoted Camus, from the fatalistic coda of “The Stranger,” hoping that “on the day of my execution there should be a huge crowd of spectators, and that they should greet me with howls of hatred.”
“I don’t trust popularity,” he told the interviewer. “When too many people think you’re wonderful, you should start to wonder.” His initial YouTube video, “Coronavirus: Game Over!” has also been renamed. The new language is more measured, and in place of the exclamation point there now stands a question mark."

As the number of people infected with the coronavirus surpasses 450,000 worldwide, and more than one billion are locked in their homes, scientists are wrestling with one of the most pressing questions of the pandemic: Do people who survive the infection become immune to the virus?
The answer is a qualified yes, with some significant unknowns. That’s important for several reasons.
People who are confirmed to be immune could venture from their homes and help shore up the work force until a vaccine becomes available, for example. In particular, health care workers who are known to be immune could continue to care for the severely ill.
Growing immunity in the community also is the way the epidemic ends: With fewer and fewer people to infect, the coronavirus will lose its toehold and even the most vulnerable citizens become more insulated from the threat.
Immunity may also bring an early treatment. Antibodies gathered from the bodies of those who have recovered may be used to aid those struggling with the illness caused by the coronavirus, called Covid-19.
On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the use of plasma from recovered patients to treat some severe cases. A day earlier, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that New York would become the first state to begin testing serum from people who have recovered from Covid-19 to treat those who are seriously ill.
“It’s a trial for people who are in serious condition, but the New York State Department of Health has been working on this with some of New York’s best health care agencies, and we think it shows promise,” Mr. Cuomo said.
The body’s first line of defense against an infectious virus is an antibody called immunoglobulin M, whose job is to stay vigilant in the body and alert the rest of the immune system to intruders like viruses and bacteria.
Days into an infection, the immune system refines this antibody into a second type, called immunoglobulin G, exquisitely designed to recognize and neutralize a specific virus.
The refinement may take as long as a week; both the process and the potency of the final antibodies can vary. Some people make powerful neutralizing antibodies to an infection, while others mount a milder response.
The antibodies generated in response to infection with some viruses — polio or measles, for example — bestow a lifetime of immunity. But antibodies to the coronaviruses that cause the common cold persist for just one to three years — and that may be true of their new cousin as well.
A study in macaques infected with the new coronavirus suggested that once infected, the monkeys produce neutralizing antibodies and resist further infection. But it is unclear how long the monkeys, or people infected with the virus, will remain immune.
Most people who became infected during the SARS epidemic — that virus is a close cousin of the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2 — had long-term immunity lasting eight to 10 years, said Vineet D. Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.
Those who recovered from MERS, another coronavirus, saw much shorter-term protection, Dr. Menachery said. People who have been infected with the new coronavirus may have immunity lasting at least one to two years, he added: “Beyond that, we can’t predict.”
Still, even if antibody protection were short-lasting and people became reinfected, the second bout with the coronavirus would likely be much milder than the first, said Florian Krammer, a microbiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.
Even after the body stops producing neutralizing antibodies, a subset of immune memory cells can reactivate a response effectively, he noted.
“You probably would make a good immune response before you even become symptomatic again and might really blunt the course of the disease,” Dr. Krammer said.
A crucial question is whether children and adults who have only mild symptoms still generate a strong enough response to remain immune to the virus until a vaccine is available.
Dr. Marion Koopmans, a virologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, and her team have screened antibody responses in 15 infected patients and health care workers.
The researchers are also using banked blood samples from about 100 people who were known to be infected with one of four coronaviruses known to cause the common cold.
If those samples show some immune response to the new coronavirus, too, Dr. Koopmans said, it might explain why some people — children, for example — have only mild symptoms. They may have antibodies to related coronaviruses that are at least somewhat effective against the new one.
The quickest way to assess immunity is a blood test that looks for protective antibodies in the blood of people who have recovered. But first you have to have the test.
Antibody tests are used in Singapore, China and a handful of other countries. But they are just coming to market in much of the West.
Last week, Dr. Krammer and his colleagues developed one such antibody test that could be scaled up in “days to weeks,” he said.
The team validated the test in blood plasma taken from three patients with Covid-19. The researchers are seeking speedy approval from the F.D.A.
Dozens of other labs are also at work on a dizzying list of tests, although they, too, are mostly based on slim data that has not yet been reviewed by other scientists.
“No matter who makes them, as long as they’re reliable, that’s a super nice tool,” Dr. Krammer said. Because this is a new coronavirus, the test should deliver “basically, a yes or no answer, like an H.I.V. test — you can figure out who was exposed and who wasn’t.”
On Wednesday, officials of Public Health England said they had purchased millions of newly developed antibody tests and were evaluating them for patients to use at home. Citizens who discovered they had been exposed and now had some immunity to the coronavirus might be able to return to normal lives, the officials said.
That would be particularly useful for health care workers. Those who know they have at least some immunity could be placed on the front lines of emergency care, sparing colleagues who have not been exposed.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]“If this really goes on for months at a time, for 18 months as some people have projected, having health care workers who are immune to the virus will be really, really helpful,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York.
But tests like these may not be of much use for diagnosis of coronavirus infection as it gets underway, because of the time it takes for the body to begin producing antibodies.
Dr. Krammer’s test picks up an antibody response as early as three days after symptoms emerge. Given that people may not show symptoms for as long as 14 days after infection, however, that is too late for the test to be useful as a diagnostic tool.
Finding people with powerful antibody responses might help point the way to new treatments, however. Essentially, antibodies extracted from the blood of recovered patients are injected into those who are ill.
Several teams have already been working on such an effort, following early reports from China of success. A Beijing-based company called AnyGo Technology has provided 50,000 tests to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, and to hospitals in Wuhan, Beijing and Shanghai, according to its founder, Dr. Le Sun.
Dr. Shangen Zheng, a doctor with the Chinese military, said his team had treated more than 10 patients so far, and data from many more patients treated with plasma in Hubei Province is being assessed.
This approach is actually “something very old-fashioned,” Dr. Krammer said. It was used to save American soldiers infected with the hemorrhagic Hantaan virus during the Korean War, and to treat people in Argentina infected with the hemorrhagic Junin virus.
Before the method can be put into wide use, however, scientists must work out safety issues, such as ensuring that the plasma taken from recovered patients is free of other viruses and toxins.
Pharmaceutical companies like Takeda and Regeneron are hoping to sidestep some of those questions by developing antibodies against the coronavirus in the laboratory.
Ultimately, it is only with these tests that scientists will be able to say when enough of the population has been infected and has become immune — and when the virus has begun to run out of hosts.Reporting was contributed by Denise Grady."
19,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/coronavirus-terms-glossary.html,The New York Times,2020-03-18,"['Jenny Gross', 'Mariel Padilla']",From Flattening the Curve to Pandemic: A Coronavirus Glossary,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/16/us/16xp-glossary/16xp-glossary-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
When is an epidemic considered a pandemic, and what is the difference? What do health officials mean when they recommend “self-quarantining” or “social distancing”?
As the coronavirus spreads around the world, new terms are entering the lexicon — and we’re here to help. Here’s a guide to the words and phrases you need to know to keep informed of the latest developments.
PandemicLast week, the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic after it spread across six continents and more than 100 countries. A pandemic is the worldwide spread of a new disease that affects large numbers of people. The W.H.O. had avoided using the word before Wednesday because it didn’t want to give the impression that the disease was unstoppable.
“Pandemic is not a word to use lightly or carelessly,” Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the W.H.O., said at a news conference.
Covid-19The technical name for the coronavirus is SARS-CoV-2. The respiratory disease it causes has been named the “coronavirus disease 2019,” or Covid-19.
Coronaviruses are named for the crown-like spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling the sun’s corona. Coronaviruses are among a large number of viruses that are common in people and many animals. The new virus, first detected in China, is believed to have originated in bats.
While antibiotics don’t work against viruses, researchers are testing drugs that could disrupt viral proteins and stop the infection.
Flattening the curveThe term refers to a curve in a chart that shows when a surge of new coronavirus cases are expected to strike and illustrates why slowing the spread of the infection is nearly as important as stopping it.
An illustration by the visual-data journalist Rosamund Pearce, based on a graphic in a C.D.C. paper titled, “Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza,” showed what Drew Harris, a population health analyst at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, called two epi curves.
The high curve showed a peak indicating a wave of coronavirus outbreak in the near term; the other had a flatter slope, indicating a more gradual rate of infection over a longer period of time.
Slowing and spreading out the tidal wave of cases will save lives.State of emergencyA state of emergency can be declared during natural disasters, epidemics and other public health emergencies. Declaring a state of emergency, as more than a dozen states — including New York, New Jersey and Michigan — have done, gives government officials the authority to take extra measures to protect the public, such as suspending regulations or reallocating funds to mitigate the spread of a disease.
Read more about those powers here.
Social distancingThe virus can easily spread in dense places — in a packed subway car, for example, or at a rally or concert.
Social distancing refers to measures that are taken to increase the physical space between people to slow the spread of the virus. Examples include working from home, school closings and the postponement or cancellation of mass gatherings, such as the South by Southwest music, technology and film conference.
By maintaining a distance of six feet from others when possible, people may limit the spread of the virus.
Self-quarantineThis is key to keeping the virus from spreading, along with measures like social distancing, frequent hand-washing and wearing masks.
While isolation refers to separating sick people from people who aren’t sick, quarantine refers to the separation and restriction of movement of people who were exposed to the virus to see if they become sick.
Who should self-quarantine? If you’ve left an area with widespread or continuing transmission, including China, Iran, Italy and South Korea, you should self-quarantine at home for a period of 14 days from the time you left, according to the C.D.C.
While in quarantine, you shouldn’t receive any visitors and must stay three to six feet from others at all times.
According to the C.D.C., once someone has been in isolation for 14 days and hasn’t become ill, he or she is not considered to be a risk to other people.
IncubationThe incubation period is the time it takes for symptoms to appear after a person is infected. This time can be critical for prevention and control, and it allows health officials to quarantine or observe people who may have been exposed to the virus.
The new coronavirus has an incubation period of two to 14 days, according to the C.D.C., with symptoms appearing about five days after infection in most cases.
During the incubation period, people may shed infectious virus particles before they exhibit symptoms, making it almost impossible to identify and isolate people who have the virus.
Fatality rateThe case fatality rate is the number of deaths divided by the total number of confirmed cases. Eventually, scientists hope to have a more comprehensive number called the infection fatality rate, which includes everyone who was infected with the virus.
The W.H.O. estimates the fatality rate of the new coronavirus to be about 3 percent, based on current data, but experts suggest 1 percent is more realistic.
R-naughtThe R-naught, or R0, is a virus’s basic reproductive number — an epidemiologic metric used to describe the contagiousness of infectious agents.
At its simplest, the basic reproductive number can show us how worried we should be about infection, according to Dr. Adam Kucharski, a mathematician at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. If the R0 is above one, each case is expected to infect at least one other person on average, and the virus is likely to keep spreading. If it’s less than one, a group of infected people are less likely to spread the infection.
Research is still in its early stages, but some estimates suggest that each person with the new coronavirus could infect between two and four people.
ContainmentThe virus’s high transmission rate has made it difficult to effectively contain the outbreak. Containment refers to the use of any available tools to mitigate the spread of a disease, said Adam Ratner, the director of the division of pediatric infectious diseases at NYU Langone Health.
Early on, the Trump administration sought to slow the spread of the virus by barring entry into the United States by any foreign nationals who had traveled to China in the previous 14 days, excluding the immediate family members of American citizens or permanent residents. While that measure may have bought the government time to prepare, the administration made key missteps in its efforts to make widespread testing available in the early days of the outbreak, when containment would have been easier.
Dr. Ratner says the coronavirus is particularly hard to contain because it is “reasonably transmissible,” and some people who don’t have a lot of symptoms can still pass the virus to others. “That’s been part of the problem,” he said, “but it also points to the fact to how interconnected we all are and how quickly this thing spread from Asia to the rest of the world.”"
20,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/14/science/animals-coronavirus-vaccine.html,The New York Times,2020-03-14,['James Gorman'],These Lab Animals Will Help Fight Coronavirus,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/13/science/13VIRUS-LABANIMALS1/13VIRUS-LABANIMALS1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
Among the many lessons of the coronavirus pandemic is how close humans are to the rest of the animal kingdom. We get diseases from other animals, and then we use more animals to figure out how to stop the diseases. As research ramps up treatments and vaccines, animals are crucial to fighting the pandemic.
There are different animals at each end of the pandemic, of course. The new disease almost certainly began with a bat virus, scientists agree. That virus probably passed through another animal, perhaps pangolins, on its way to humans.
But the animals that scientists will depend on in the lab are mice, first of all, and then perhaps ferrets or hamsters or monkeys. Around the world, different laboratories are racing to breed stocks of mice genetically engineered for research and testing the susceptibility of other animals to infection with the virus that causes Covid-19.
There are, of course, many objections to animal testing, particularly when it comes to primates, but researchers are deeply concerned about the hazards to humans of treatments or vaccines that have not been tried on other animals first.
No single kind of animal will serve all test purposes and scientists have several criteria for what makes an animal useful in testing therapies and vaccines for effectiveness.
First, it must be susceptible to infection, and not all animals are. Despite the quarantining of one dog in Hong Kong, with a “weak positive” test for coronavirus, various health agencies are not taking a single, ambiguous result as evidence for concern. Advisories state there is no evidence yet that pets are susceptible to the disease.
And even when laboratory animals are susceptible to infection, that doesn’t mean they get sick. “Most of them, they don’t care at all that they’re infected,” said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a microbiologist at the University of Iowa who developed a mouse in 2003 that was susceptible to infection with the SARS virus. It is called the hACE2 mouse.
If an animal doesn’t get sick from the infection, its use is limited, because testing treatment effectiveness requires observing whether the treatment stops the symptoms.
The best laboratory animal would not only get infected and get sick, but get sick in the same way that humans do, showing a similar course of disease. Then a test would give the most information.
Dr. Perlman pointed out that the hACE2 strain of mice susceptible to SARS got sick, “but developed a brain disease” in addition to other symptoms. A new study from China, not yet peer-reviewed, suggests that these mice do get infected with the new pandemic virus, which is called SARS-CoV-2, and develop mild pneumonia. The paper made no mention of the virus affecting the brain.
This strain of mice will be used in some of the first laboratory experiments. But first it is necessary to breed them. Like many other genetically engineered mice varieties, scientists don’t keep live colonies on hand. Instead the mice’s frozen sperm and embryos are kept ready.
The hACE2 mice were put on ice when the SARS outbreak stopped in the early 2000s. Chien-Te Tseng at the University of Texas Medical Branch, who independently developed an hACE2 mouse, is now building up a colony from frozen embryos in his lab. Mice have a three-week gestation period, or pregnancy, and take eight weeks to reach sexual maturity.
Dr. Perlman is not rejuvenating the strain himself. He sent 16 vials of frozen sperm to the Jackson Laboratory in Maine, one of the biggest breeders of laboratory animals, so they can ramp up their production.
They hope to have mice ready for distribution, at cost, by May, according to Cat Lutz, director of the mouse repository, with responsibility for thousands of strains of mice, including the hACE2.
The advantage of this strain is that it has a human receptor on its cells called an ACE2 receptor, thus its name. That allows it to be infected with SARS and the new coronavirus, which both target that receptor as they try to invade cells.
“There’s a huge demand,” Dr. Lutz said, “not only in the United States, but globally.”Dr. Lutz said that researchers at the Jackson Laboratory will also be investigating other ways to make mice more susceptible to the new coronavirus.
“There’s never only one mouse model that we use.” For diabetes she said, “we have eight different models that we’ll look at depending on the answer that we want to ask. And I think the same is going to be true in this circumstance as well.”
Dr. Michael Diamond, in infectious disease specialist at Washington University in St. Louis, is also planning to do research with the hACE2 mouse, and other strains.
He said that although mice take time to breed, creating a supply of them is still quicker than using larger animals. Mice, he said, may help scientists “to sort of winnow down some of the candidates” for vaccines.
Dr. Diamond also said that groups around the globe are pursuing many of the same goals. At first it might seem redundant, but because there are so many unanticipated problems that arise in vaccine and treatment tests, redundancy is a feature of the scientific process rather than a drawback.
Inevitably, he said, vaccine and treatment researchers will move to other animals, perhaps hamsters and ferrets, but certainly monkeys, which are most likely to replicate how the disease progresses in humans. All work with the live virus takes place in level 3 biosecure labs, Dr. Diamond said.
Dave O’Connor, a pathologist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, is working with colleagues to test the usefulness of monkeys in the study of coronavirus treatments. He said that a Chinese group had already published some data on rhesus macaques and he had heard that more results from other labs around the world would be coming soon.
Those results would be on the suitability of primates for laboratory tests, not on immediate cures. “This is not the movie ‘Contagion’ where there will be a magic discovery in a monkey that allows everyone to recover immediately,” he said.
He added that, “We are potentially going to be dealing with this for a really long time and need to come to better terms with that.”"
21,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/health/n95-masks-decontaminated-coronavirus.html,The New York Times,2020-04-16,['James Gorman'],"Disposable N95 Masks Can Be Decontaminated, Researchers Confirm",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/16/science/16VIRUS-MASKS/16VIRUS-MASKS-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
Researchers have confirmed that there are several effective methods for decontaminating the N95 masks worn by health professionals so that they can be used more than once, the National Institutes of Health announced Wednesday.
A substantial body of research already showed that the masks, designed for one-time use, can be reused in a crisis. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March authorized reuse because of shortages driven by the Covid-19 pandemic. In recent weeks the Food and Drug Administration has issued emergency approvals for several systems of mask decontamination.
None of these rules or methods are intended for the cloth masks recommended or in some locations required for use by everyone in public. The C.D.C. advises regular washing of homemade fabric masks in a washing machine.
Earlier research had not, of course, involved the new coronavirus. The new research, done at the Rocky Mountain Laboratories of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and used live novel coronavirus, formally known as SARS-CoV-2, to test the mask material. The study determined which decontamination procedures were most effective, and how they affected the integrity of the masks.
Vincent Munster, one of the authors of the new work, who collaborated with other government researchers and scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles, said the work built on more than a decade of studies of decontamination. “We showed that it actually works as well for SARS-CoV-2 as for influenza,” and for bacteria, he said.
The research was posted on MedRxiv, a website where scientists have been posting articles submitted for publication elsewhere that have not yet been through peer review. But N.I.H. publicized the study because it could be helpful to health care professionals in the midst of a crisis, and it was validating and extending previous work, not suggesting untried methods.
Dr. Munster and his colleagues tested four methods of killing the virus: UV light, dry heat, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) and ethyl alcohol. Of those methods, they did not recommend ethyl alcohol because although it killed the virus, it degraded the mask material.
The researchers first tested samples of N95 material to which live virus had been applied. That work was done in a biosecure lab. After treatment, they cultured virus particles from the material to see if the shielding remained effective in limiting transmission.
Then they tested the same methods on whole masks without the virus to determine whether their structure and functioning were damaged after rounds of decontamination.
Dr. Munster said that even if decontamination worked perfectly, but the mask no longer fit “then obviously your mask is not really good for reuse anymore.”
Vaporized hydrogen peroxide, a method often available in large hospitals, was effective, and left the masks still functioning for at least three rounds of decontamination, as did UV light.
Dry heat, at 70 degrees Celsius or 158 degrees Fahrenheit, was effective, but the masks withstood only two rounds of decontamination. Dr. Munster said that “vaporized hydrogen peroxide would be the method of choice if that’s available.” However, he said, a nursing home might not have that, while for dry heat, what’s needed is basically an oven.
Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health, said in an email that she thought the new research was an “excellent contribution.” She said it was “helpful to see that either VHP or UV can effectively sterilize N95 masks and make them available for reuse up to three times.”
Another recent study from Canadian researchers, also not yet peer reviewed, confirmed the value of decontamination. It included masks of different brands and found that the material of the mask was still effective after 10 rounds of vaporized hydrogen peroxide decontamination.
One of the authors of that paper, Dr. Anand Kumar at the University of Manitoba, said that his procedure was slightly different from Dr. Munster’s in that it did not test the structure and facial fit of the mask, only the filtering ability of the material.
The recommendations and findings in the two papers are intended to be useful for institutions that have health care workers wearing N95 masks. With personal protective equipment in short supply at many overwhelmed hospitals, some front-line workers, including doctors and nurses, have complained that masks were rationed.
The public has been advised not to use or try to buy N95 masks because they would be depriving health care workers of lifesaving equipment.
“And if they do, they shouldn’t try decontaminating them,” Dr. Kumar said."

On a cold morning in February 2018, a group of 30 microbiologists, zoologists and public-health experts from around the world met at the headquarters of the World Health Organization in Geneva. The group was established by the W.H.O. in 2015 to create a priority list of dangerous viruses — specifically, those for which no vaccines or drugs were already in development. The consensus, at least among those in the room, was that as populations and global travel continued to grow and development increasingly pushed into wild areas, it was almost inevitable that once-containable local outbreaks, like SARS or Ebola, could become global disasters.
“The meeting was in a big room, with all the tables arranged around the edge, facing each other,” one of the group’s members, Peter Daszak, recalled recently. “It was a very formal process. Each person was asked to present the case for including a particular disease on the list of top threats. And everything you say is being taken down, and checked factually, and recorded.”
Daszak, who directs the pandemic-prevention group EcoHealth Alliance and is also chairman of the Forum on Microbial Threats at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, had been given the task of presenting on SARS, a lethal coronavirus that killed roughly 800 people after it emerged in 2002. (SARS stands for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome and is officially known as SARS-CoV-1.) “We’d done a lot of research on coronaviruses, so we knew they were a clear and present danger,” he told me. “High mortality, no drugs or vaccines in the pipeline, with new variants that could still be emerging.”
The discussion, he said, was intense. “Everyone else in the room knows the facts already — they’ve read all the research,” Daszak said. But for each pathogen, the speaker had to convince the room that it presented a significant threat — “that this disease really could take off, and that we should concentrate on it rather than on Lassa fever or something else. So, you argue the case, and then people vote. And sometimes it gets quite heated. I remember that monkey pox was an issue, because there are outbreaks, but there’s really nothing we can do about them. It was a really rigorous, really excellent debate — and then afterward, we went and had fondue.”
The final list — which did contain SARS and MERS, along with seven other respiratory, hemorrhagic or otherwise-lethal viruses — also included something the W.H.O. dubbed “Disease X”: a stand-in for all the unknown pathogens, or devastating variations on existing pathogens, that had yet to emerge. Daszak describes Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2, as exactly the kind of threat that Disease X was meant to represent: a novel, highly infectious coronavirus, with a high mortality rate, and no existing treatment or prevention. “The problem isn’t that prevention was impossible,” Daszak told me. “It was very possible. But we didn’t do it. Governments thought it was too expensive. Pharmaceutical companies operate for profit.” And the W.H.O., for the most part, had neither the funding nor the power to enforce the large-scale global collaboration necessary to combat it.
As Covid-19 has spread around the world, overwhelming hospitals and even mortuaries, there has been widespread consternation over how we could have been caught so flat-footed by a virus. Given all the shining advances of high-tech medicine — computer-controlled surgery, unprecedented immunotherapies, artificial-intelligence programs for assessing heart-disease risk — this failure feels utterly baffling. How could the entire world remain so powerless? More important, what could be different next time?
According to some infectious-disease experts, the scientific tools already exist to create a kind of viral-defense department — one that would allow us to pursue a broad range of vital global projects, from developing vaccines and drugs that work against a wide range of pathogens to monitoring disease hot spots and identifying potential high-risk viruses, both known and unknown. What’s lacking is resources. “We really did miss the wake-up call,” Daszak says. “The alarm went off with SARS, and we hit the snooze button. And then we hit it again with Ebola, with MERS, with Zika. Now that we’re awake, we should think about where to go from here.”
In late March, Vincent Racaniello, host of the podcast “This Week in Virology” and a professor at Columbia University, conducted an interview with the pediatric infectious-disease expert Mark Denison. Denison, who teaches at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, led a team that developed one of the most promising current treatments for Covid-19: the drug remdesivir, currently being tested by the pharmaceutical company Gilead Sciences.
On the show, Denison noted that because it is almost impossible to predict which virus might cause the next pandemic, researchers had long argued that it was essential to design panviral drugs and vaccines that would be effective against a wide range of strains: all types of influenza, for instance, or a substantial group of coronaviruses rather than just one. When his lab was first applying for a grant to study remdesivir, Denison recalled, that was already the goal. “We don’t want to work with a compound unless it inhibits every coronavirus we test,” Denison said. “Because we’re worried about MERS, we’re worried about SARS-1, but they’re not really our problem. The future is the problem.”
Panviral drugs — ones that work broadly within or across virus families — are harder to make than broad-spectrum antibiotics, largely because viruses work by hijacking the machinery of our cells, harnessing their key functions in order to replicate. A drug that blocks one of those functions (e.g., the production of a particular protein) is often also disrupting something that our own cells need to survive. Researchers have begun to find ways around that problem, in part by refining which process a drug targets. But they’ve also begun to test existing drugs against a wider array of viruses. It was in just such a follow-up screen that Gilead discovered that remdesivir, originally developed to treat hepatitis C and later tried against Ebola, might be effective against coronaviruses. (Favipiravir, an influenza drug developed in Japan, is another broad-spectrum candidate.) The reason drugs sometimes work in extremely different diseases — in, say, Ebola and coronaviruses and flu — is that they block some common mechanism. Remdesivir and favipiravir, for instance, each mimics a key building block in a virus’s RNA, which, when inserted, keeps the virus from replicating. “It’s definitely possible to make a drug that would work across a good range of coronaviruses,” Racaniello says. “We honestly should have had one long ago, since SARS in 2003. It would have taken care of this outbreak in China before it got out. And the only reason we didn’t is because there wasn’t enough financial backing.”
Panviral vaccines are also becoming a real possibility. In recent years, a number of prospective universal flu vaccines have been developed that work by targeting not the virus’s globular head, which mutates easily, but its stalk, which barely mutates at all. (As Daszak noted, if this outbreak had been a flu rather than a coronavirus, we’d be in much better shape.) Another new approach, mRNA vaccines, works by exploiting messenger RNA — a kind of courier that communicates the genetic instructions for making proteins — to drive an immune response. The advantages of mRNA vaccines are potentially enormous, in part because they can be made very quickly (one month instead of six for a known strain; two to three months for a novel virus) but also because they can be made on a vast scale (billions of doses, compared with the 100,000 doses that were needed for the Ebola epidemic). They’re extremely adaptable too: If a researcher can develop a platform that works with this coronavirus, it’s easy to redesign it for the next one. (One mRNA start-up, Moderna, set a drug-industry record by creating a prospective Covid-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273, in just 42 days, using the virus’s genetic sequence. The drug is currently in Phase 1 clinical trials to be safety-tested on healthy volunteers.) And while no mRNA vaccines have yet received F.D.A. approval, Covid-19 will almost certainly change that.
But for years, Racaniello notes, the real obstacle to making panviral drugs or vaccines has been that no one was willing to pay for their development. For pharmaceutical companies, he points out, panviral vaccines are simply a terrible business proposition: Companies have to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop a shot that people will get once a year at most — and not at all in years when no particular disease is ascendant.
Panviral drug treatments are unprofitable for similar reasons. For one, the course of treatment is short, usually just a few weeks; for chronic diseases (diabetes, high blood pressure), patients take regimens of pills daily, often for years. (One person noted that Gilead’s stock price actually dropped after the company produced a revolutionary hepatitis C drug. Because the treatment completely cured patients, the market for it started to shrink, undermining the company’s bottom line.)
The other problem is that there’s currently no way to quickly test for most viruses, which is essential if a doctor wants to establish a diagnosis and prescribe the right drug. As a result, Racaniello says, it’s “a chicken-and-egg situation: No one is developing drugs for these viruses because there’s no way to test for them. And no one is developing tests, because there aren’t any drugs to prescribe.”
Governments, meanwhile, have been reluctant to fund panviral development — both because it’s expensive and because the rewards can feel remote, especially as many diseases originate in other countries. “We don’t prevent well; we respond well,” Daszak notes. “Remember when Obama got $5 billion for the Ebola outbreak in West Africa, and U.S. troops went to help fix the problem? That’s heroic. How heroic is it, three years before Ebola, to say, ‘We’re going to fund a massive program in West Africa to help these poor countries get ready in case an outbreak happens?’ He’d be laughed out of the room!”
Global nonprofits like the Gates Foundation have tried to step into this funding void. The foundation has supported GAVI, an international alliance that helps vaccinate children in poor countries and spearheaded a fund to fight H.I.V., tuberculosis and malaria worldwide. Mark Suzman, the chief executive of the Gates Foundation, says that when governments and companies do pull together, the focus is often on projects like these rather than “forward-looking” issues like pandemics or climate change. One exception, he says, has been CEPI, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an NGO that was founded in 2017 to coordinate and finance the development of new vaccines for diseases that might lead to a pandemic. When it started, Suzman told me, CEPI was a low-profile project: “It was really a response to the Ebola epidemic of 2014 and 2015. Now, of course, it looks incredibly farsighted.”
CEPI works by identifying the most promising research, and then connecting it to industry and government resources, in order to bring multiple sets of “candidate” vaccines through initial clinical trials. The goal is to create a stockpile of potential treatments for known coronaviruses, hemorrhagic fevers and other global threats that could quickly go into production in the event of an epidemic. Daszak noted that CEPI is running a trial for a vaccine against Nipah virus, a zoonotic virus — one that exists in animals but can infect people — which can cause acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis. “This is the classic example,” Daszak says. “So far, there have been only a few outbreaks, so the market is minuscule: a few thousand people a year get it, in Malaysia or Bangladesh. But it infects a wide range of animals, and that means it’s likely to keep crossing over into people. And if it ever broke out, it could be a pandemic with very lethal consequences.”
The group also funds technologies aimed at “Disease X” (the potentially pandemic viruses that we have yet to discover) with the goal of faster vaccine development should a totally new threat emerge. As Jake Glanville, whose company, Distributed Bio, received a grant from Gates Foundation to create a universal flu vaccine, told me, “This is how we win the forever war, and not just battles against these pathogens.”
CEPI isn’t the only group trying to find solutions to the drug and vaccine problems. In the United States, a federally funded university collective called the Antiviral Drug Discovery and Development Center (AD3C) was created in 2014, with the goal of developing drugs for influenza, flaviviruses (including West Nile), coronaviruses and alphaviruses. Like CEPI, AD3C partners with pharmaceutical companies but focuses on salvaging and reformulating promising drugs that might be valuable but that the company isn’t interested in pursuing. (When Gilead discovered that remdesivir worked on coronaviruses, for instance, the treatment was routed to AD3C, which enlisted scientists at Vanderbilt University and the University of North Carolina to repurpose it.)
Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar who specializes in infectious-disease and pandemic preparedness at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security, told me that approaches like these are going to be “instrumental” in preventing whatever comes after Covid-19. “In the wake of this pandemic, people are going to realize that spending money on organizations like CEPI is a good investment — especially when you realize how much having a vaccine against the coronavirus would have offset the damage and destruction and disruption that we’ve seen.”
Despite these efforts, there is still one overarching problem: how little is known about the planet’s viral threats. Viruses make up roughly two-thirds of all newly discovered human pathogens — far more than either bacteria or fungi. Over the course of human evolution, we’ve been exposed to so many that about 8 percent of the human genome is made up of retroviral DNA sequences that have inserted themselves into the human germ line, often to our benefit. (An ancient virus is thought to be responsible for the development of the human placenta, for example.)
Perversely, viruses get no advantage from making people seriously ill; it’s simply a byproduct of the encounter. Over the years, or sometimes centuries, viruses and hosts usually reach an accommodation: They coexist. Typically, the most dangerous viruses are those that have jumped into humans from other species, as happened with Covid-19. That’s partly because the disease is new, so our immune system hasn’t had a chance to create antibodies. But it’s also because an unfamiliar virus is more likely to throw our immune system into overdrive, potentially fatally.
For anyone hoping to identify where the next pandemic is coming from, the difficulty is that there are literally millions of viruses to analyze. One paper recently estimated that there were 1.6 million potentially zoonotic viruses, of which fewer than 1 percent have even been identified. “One thing we definitely need is better diagnostic testing where we’re actually looking for these emerging pathogens in people,” Adalja says. “Because there are already many, many one-off cases that no one ever diagnoses, but which could be the first sign of a new virus jumping into a human species.” While influenza and coronaviruses are known pandemic threats, they’re far from the only ones. Nipah and Hendra viruses are deadly paramyxoviruses that have emerged from bats within the past three decades. Marburg is a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever like Ebola, but without any vaccine or treatment in the pipeline. (Dozens of other hemorrhagic viruses also exist, but so far haven’t made the jump to humans.)
One argument against doing this kind of work has been that the risk of any single virus’s causing a pandemic is low. Most viruses simply aren’t equipped to make the jump from animals to humans — and even when they do, most aren’t able to replicate in ways that become dangerous or spread from person to person. The problem, Daszak says, is that when you multiply a 10-million-to-one event by the total number of animal-human interactions, the probability isn’t that low after all. “It’s really easy to scientifically demonstrate that these are rare events and we shouldn’t bother,” he added. H.I.V., for instance, was originally present in primates, and spilled over into the human population only about 10 times in the span of a century; each time, it quickly died out — until it didn’t. “Statistically, when you look at the likelihood that a virus will, first, be able get into a person, and then be able to replicate, and then get transmitted through sex, the probability seems like it should be minuscule! But what we failed to appreciate was both the adaptability of viruses, and the dimensions of the human-wildlife interface.”
Hoping to get a more accurate estimate of which viruses could be a threat, Daszak recently traveled to a rural part of Yunnan province, in China, and took blood samples from people who live there, looking for antibodies that would show how often they had been exposed to bat coronaviruses. (Detectable antibodies typically last two to three years after an infection.) “This was bat coronaviruses alone — not all the other stuff that’s out there,” Daszak said. “And we found that 3 percent of the population had been exposed — which tells me that these things are spilling over at an incredible rate, as part of everyday business in rural China.”
Which means, Daszak says, that between one million and seven million people a year in Southeast Asia pick up bat coronaviruses. “For most of them, it probably doesn’t even cause illness. There may have been some little outbreaks that never got noticed, or cases where people even die, and it gets put down to influenza or something.” He paused. “But that is a huge level of spillover. It’s not difficult to imagine one of those infections mutating a bit and becoming Covid-19.”
Policing points of potential spillover is challenging — and the effort needed to rigorously track and test wildlife even more so. As Racaniello observed, “We’ve known since SARS that bats harbor dangerous coronaviruses. So bats are an obvious place to look. But even then it’s not easy to do. You have to crawl into a bat cave, you have to catch them somehow. It’s tedious, costly work.”
In the United States, for example, some species of mice harbor hantavirus, which periodically infects people, most often when they inhale aerosolized mouse droppings — say, when sweeping out a dusty cabin or garage. Because the infection, which starts like a flu but is fatal in 38 percent of cases, doesn’t spread from person to person (yet), the pandemic risk is currently low, Racaniello says. “A good question is, what would have to happen for that virus to become human-to-human transmissible? And also, what else do mice have that might be a threat to people? But the mice of the United States have barely been sampled, in terms of the viruses they carry.”
During the Obama administration, a U.S.A.I.D. program called PREDICT was created to fill that gap, by using biological surveillance and predictive modeling to identify the most likely sources of zoonotic disease. During the 10 years the program existed, researchers found more than a thousand new potential zoonotic viruses, including an unknown Ebola strain. (Daszak, whose group received financial support from PREDICT, called the project “visionary.”) After the program’s funding ended in September, shortly before the coronavirus outbreak began, the Trump administration authorized two successive six-month extensions. A U.S.A.I.D. spokesperson said that in September, there will be “a planned transition” to a new prevention program, Stop Spillover, with a proposed budget of between $50 million and $100 million over five years. “For these sorts of programs to work, you have to be patient,” Racaniello told me. “But these projects also cost money, and they don’t necessarily seem like they’re producing much in the short term, so they’re the easiest things to cut when you want to cut a budget.”
One challenge for pandemic hunters is understanding which animals are most likely to be the source of viruses. Bats, the original carriers for many zoonotic viruses, rarely pass those diseases to humans directly. (One study found that bats in China harbor more than 500 different coronaviruses, but they also carry paramyxoviruses, influenza and hemorrhagic viruses like Ebola.) More often, Daszak explained, bats infect another animal, which then infects us. “About a fifth of all mammals are bats,” Daszak points out. “And they’re all over the globe. We just don’t realize that, because they fly at night. But they’re out there, pooping all over the place — just like deer and birds, except we don’t see it.” (It’s worth noting that, of the thousands of bat species, only a few — such as the fruit bat and horseshoe bat — are currently thought to be the major reservoirs of zoonotic disease.)
Bats also fly, can live for a long time and thrive across a huge range of habitats, which means that we, and other animals, are more likely to come in contact with them than with other species. Racaniello pointed to an outbreak in Australia in the 1990s that was caused when bats began frequenting a racehorse stable, infecting the horses, which then passed the disease on to their human trainers. In Malaysia, Nipah virus emerged from pigs, on farms in an area that harbored fruit bats. In the Middle East, the MERS coronavirus — which most likely originated in a bat — became endemic in camels, who at some point started passing it on to people.
“Before that outbreak, it wouldn’t have occurred to anyone to look in camels for a pandemic virus,” Racaniello said. “The same is true for a lot of things. For instance, we knew that bats carried SARS-like coronaviruses, but it was only when they started looking for the cause of the first SARS outbreak that they found it had jumped from bats to civet cats, which is how we got it. But as to all the other animals in the world, we pretty much have no idea! So, I think you just need to cast a very wide net.”
To do that, Daszak helped found an ambitious project called the Global Virome Project, which seeks to identify 70 percent of the estimated 1.6 million potentially zoonotic viruses over 10 years, at a cost of $1.2 billion. “We found the closest relative to the current SARS-CoV-2 in a bat in China in 2013,” Daszak told me. “We sequenced a bit of the genome, and then it went in the freezer; because it didn’t look like SARS, we thought it was at a lower risk of emerging. With the Virome project, we could have sequenced the whole genome, discovered that it binds to human cells and upgraded the risk. And maybe then when we were designing vaccines for SARS, those could have targeted this one too, and we would have had something in the freezer ready to go if it emerged.”
Racaniello supports this strategy — “I like the test-every-creature-on-Earth approach, personally” — but acknowledged that there were also ways to narrow the field. Risky zoonotic viruses, he noted, are more likely to be found in mammals or birds; anything else is just too big a genetic jump. Within that group, animals that are evolutionarily closer to us are also higher-risk, because we share more of the receptors that viruses use when they infect a cell.
Another risk factor is simply how likely we are to come into contact with a particular animal, whether from activities like logging, through the wildlife trade or through farming. (Measles is thought to have arisen out of the domestication of cattle, while pigs and chickens carry swine flu and bird flu.) But while vaccines exist for some domesticated animals — there’s a successful one for coronavirus in chickens, and researchers recently created a MERS vaccine for camels — there’s no way to vaccinate wildlife, or even urban animals like mice.
“That’s why we need to be studying these things,” Daszak says. “We’ve shown repeatedly that any disease, once it gets into human-to-human-transmission mode, it’s going to come to the U.S. We’re always in the top five every time we do that analysis. We said, about Ebola, because it’s not respiratory, it’s never going to break out of a village, or a country. And it did! And if you get a version with a longer asymptomatic incubation time, like we have with Covid-19, imagine what that could look like.”
In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, more systems of global cooperation and investment have started to emerge. In late March, the Gates Foundation set up a Covid-19 Therapeutic Accelerator to screen a vast number of existing drugs and compounds that hadn’t made it to market, in order to test whether they might work on other diseases.
The screening, done by the Rega Institute in Belgium, will scan and test 14,000 compounds in a Scripps Research Institute library, as well as the proprietary libraries of 15 pharmaceutical companies, including Bristol-Myers Squibb, Eli Lilly, Merck, Novartis and Pfizer, for possible crossover treatments. Because most of the drugs have already been tested for safety, they need to be tested only for efficacy, speeding up the process.
The willingness to share proprietary compounds, says Suzman of the Gates Foundation, is “pretty unprecedented.” And while that collaboration is currently focused on Covid-19, the hope is that, after the current crisis has passed, that same collection could be screened for more ambitious projects — like a broad-spectrum anti-coronavirus drug. “I am optimistic — cautiously optimistic — that this is a kind of precedent,” Suzman said. “And that it will lead to more and better global health collaboration.”
Monalisa Chatterji, a microbiologist who is part of the Gates Foundation’s drug-discovery arm, agrees. “The conversation has started” for future pandemics, she told me. “Should there be a standing shared library of unused drugs that research labs can test? Should similar things be done around diagnostics? Should there at least be an agreement where every company has already agreed to provide access to its library in a pandemic situation?” She added, “That sounds small, but it’s these small things that eat up time when it matters.”
The big question, according to nearly everyone I spoke with, is whether we’ll manage to maintain this political and financial will over time. Racaniello and Daszak both remember being sure that after SARS and Ebola, pandemic prevention would be a priority; instead, each outbreak was quickly forgotten. And while it’s hard to imagine forgetting the current disaster, researchers worry that funding and attention will once again fade in the face of competing pressures. As Rancaniello observed, the combined 2019 budgets for the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation was $47 billion — less than 7 percent of the $686 billion allocated to defense. “I would argue that viruses are just as much a threat as a bad nation would be to the military,” Racaniello said.
Or as Daszak put it: “We don’t think twice about the cost of protecting against terrorism. We go out there, we listen to the whispers, we send out the drones — we have a whole array of approaches. We need to start thinking about pandemics the same way.”"
23,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/health/cats-pets-coronavirus.html,The New York Times,2020-04-22,['James Gorman'],Two Cats Are First U.S. Pets to Test Positive for Coronavirus,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/22/science/22VIRUS-PETCATS1/22VIRUS-PETCATS1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
The first pets in the United States, two cats from New York State, have tested positive for the virus that is causing the worldwide pandemic, the Agriculture Department and the Centers for Disease Control announced Wednesday.
The cats, from different parts of the state, are showing only mild symptoms and are expected to be fine.
Testing positive does not mean the cats have the same illness that people have. Nor does it mean that the cats can pass on the illness to people. And tests for pets are not the same as those for people, so no humans missed out on testing because the cats were tested.
Veterinarians took samples from both cats that were tested at a private lab. The test results were then confirmed at a national veterinary lab. The owners brought both cats to veterinarians because they showed symptoms of a respiratory infection. One owner had tested positive for the virus. No human in the other cat’s household tested positive.
Other cats have tested positive for the virus, SARS-CoV-2, including a pet in Belgium and a tiger at the Bronx zoo. After the tiger who showed mild symptoms tested positive, the zoo collected fecal samples from other big cats and found that a total of five tigers and three lions had been infected. One of the tigers didn’t show any symptoms. All of the big cats are doing well, the zoo reported Wednesday.
In an experiment in China, cats were shown to be susceptible to infection with the coronavirus, showing mild symptoms. The researchers said the experiment also showed that cats could pass the virus to other cats. But that was in a laboratory setting. The virus was detected by tests done after the cats had been euthanized. The researchers noted in the paper, “It was difficult to perform regular nasal wash collection on the sub-adult cats because they were aggressive.”
The Agriculture Department and the C.D.C. emphasized that “there is no evidence that pets play a role in spreading the virus in the United States.” Other experts agree that people should not start looking at their cats with suspicion. If anything, it’s the other way around.
Karen Terio, the chief of the Zoological Pathology Program at University of Illinois’s veterinary college, where the Bronx Zoo tiger sample was tested, noted that hundreds of thousands of people have tested positive in the United States, as opposed to two cats.
Dr. Terio said that while the tests and the earlier experiments did show that cats appear to be somewhat susceptible to the virus, “If this was going to be a serious problem for cats, we would have seen greater numbers.” Either very few cats are being infected, or their symptoms are so mild that their owners don’t notice them or think they warrant a trip to the vet. The direction of infection “is not going to be cat to human,” she said. “It’s going to be us to our pets. Thankfully, they’re having very mild disease.”
For now, the C.D.C. recommends keeping cats indoors to prevent them from contact with other animals or people. And for people who become sick, they recommend, as they have in the past, isolating from pets as much as possible, treating them as you would a human being in your family.
Dogs are less susceptible to infection with the virus, according to the same research paper on cats. Although there is some evidence that they may have low-level infections, they haven’t shown any symptoms. Nonetheless, the C.D.C. recommends that you put dogs on a six-foot leash when walking them, keep them away from other animals and avoid contact as much as possible with any pets if you are sick. The American Veterinary Medical Association has the same advice, which did not change with the new announcement.
The Agriculture Department will post any confirmed tests of animals with SARS-CoV-2 on its website. It does not recommend routine testing for pets."

A new study offers a glimmer of hope in the grim fight against the coronavirus: Nearly everyone who has had the disease — regardless of age, sex or severity of illness — makes antibodies to the virus.
The study, posted online on Tuesday but not yet reviewed by experts, also hints that anyone who has recovered from infection may safely return to work — although it is unclear how long their protection might last.
“This is very good news,” said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York who was not involved with the work.
Antibodies are immune molecules produced by the body to fight pathogens. The presence of antibodies in the blood typically confers at least some protection against the invader.
Health officials in several countries, including the United States, have hung their hopes on tests that identify coronavirus antibodies to decide who is immune and can go back to work. People who are immune could replace vulnerable individuals, especially in high-transmission settings like hospitals, building what researchers call “shield immunity” in the population.
But most antibody tests are fraught with false positives — picking up antibody signals where there are none. The new study relied on a test developed by Florian Krammer, a virologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, that has a less than 1 percent chance of producing false-positive results.
Several small studies have given reason to hope that people who have had Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, would gain some immunity for some period of time. The new study is the largest by far, with results from 1,343 people in and around New York City.
The study also eased a niggling worry that only some people — only those who were severely ill, for example — might make antibodies. In fact, the level of antibodies did not differ by age or sex, and even people who had only mild symptoms produced a healthy amount.
Having antibodies is not the same as having immunity to the virus. But in previous research, Dr. Krammer’s team has shown that antibody levels are closely linked with the ability to disarm the virus, the key to immunity.
“It really shows that most people do develop antibodies, and that there’s very good correlation between those antibodies and their capability to neutralize virus,” Dr. Rasmussen said.
Researchers at Mount Sinai tested people who signed up to be donors of convalescent plasma, antibodies extracted from blood. The project has enrolled more than 15,000 people so far, according to Dr. Ania Wajnberg, who is leading the effort.
The new study is an analysis of results of the first set of donors. Over all, only 3 percent of these participants had been seen in the emergency department or had been hospitalized. The remaining subjects had only mild or moderate symptoms.
“To my knowledge, this is the largest group of people described with mild disease,” Dr. Wajnberg said.
The criteria for inclusion became more stringent as the team learned more about the coronavirus. For example, they initially required the potential donors to be free of symptoms for only three days but later extended that to 14 days.
The team tested 624 people who had tested positive for the virus and had recovered. At first, just 511 of them had high antibody levels; 42 had low levels; and 71 had none. When 64 of the subjects with weak or no levels were retested more than a week later, however, all but three had at least some antibodies.
That suggests the timing of testing for antibodies can greatly affect the results, the researchers said. “We weren’t looking exactly at this, but we had enough to say that 14 days is probably a little too early,” Dr. Wajnberg said.
There was even a difference between levels at 20 days versus 24 days, she said, suggesting that the optimal time for an antibody test is well after symptoms begin. “What we’re telling people now is at least three weeks after symptom onset,” Dr. Wajnberg said.
Because tests to diagnose coronavirus infection were unavailable to most people in New York City in March, the researchers included another 719 people in their study who suspected they had Covid-19 based on symptoms and exposure to the virus, but in whom the illness had not been diagnosed.
In this group, the researchers found a different picture altogether. The majority of these people — 62 percent — did not seem to have antibodies.
Some of them may have been tested too soon after their illness for antibodies to be detectable. But many probably mistook influenza, another viral infection or even allergies for Covid-19, Dr. Wajnberg said.
“I think literally everybody in New York thinks they’ve had it,” she said. “People shouldn’t assume the fever they had in January was Covid and they’re immune.”
Other experts were more struck by the percentage of people who turned out to have antibodies, even though the coronavirus had never been diagnosed in them.
The number suggests that “in cities like New York, there are a tremendous number of undiagnosed infections,” said Taia Wang, a viral immunologist at Stanford University.
An antibody survey conducted by New York State officials found that 20 percent of city residents had been infected.
Another finding from the study — that diagnostic PCR tests can be positive up to 28 days after the start of infection — is also important, Dr. Wang said. These tests look for genetic fragments, not antibodies, and suggest an active or waning infection.
“As far as known unknowns about SARS-CoV-2, this one really stands out,” she said. “We really need to know, how long does it take the body to clear the virus? How long are people contagious? We don’t know the answer to that.”
She and other scientists said it was highly unlikely that a positive test so long after symptoms appeared represents infectious virus. Researchers in South Korea recently announced, for example, that several suspected cases of “reinfection” were a result of PCR tests picking up remnants of dead virus.
Genetic material from the measles virus can show up in tests six months after the illness, Dr. Krammer noted. And genetic fragments of Ebola and Zika viruses are known to persist even longer in the body.
Still, Dr. Wang said, “Until we do know, it’s prudent for everyone to proceed as if a positive PCR test means contagious virus.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people isolate for 10 days after the onset of symptoms, but that period may need to be longer.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]Experts said the next step would be to confirm that the presence of antibodies in the blood means protection from the coronavirus. The body depends on a subset of antibodies, called neutralizing antibodies, to shield it from the coronavirus.
“The question now becomes to what extent those are neutralizing antibodies and whether that leads to protection from infection — all of which we should presume are yes,” said Sean Whelan, a virologist at Washington University in St. Louis.
In Dr. Krammer’s previous work, to be published in the journal Nature Medicine, his team tested whether the antibodies have neutralizing power. The researchers found that in about a dozen people, including some who had mild symptoms, the level of antibodies in the blood corresponded to the level of neutralizing activity.
So everyone who makes antibodies is likely to have some immunity to the virus, Dr. Krammer said: “I’m fairly confident about this.” Another way to assess immunity would be to show that purified antibodies can prevent coronavirus infection in an animal.
But perhaps the most urgent question, especially as research on vaccines ramps up, is how long that immunity might last.
Even if the levels of antibodies fall over time to undetectable levels, people may still retain some protection from the coronavirus.
Immune cells called T cells are valuable soldiers in fighting pathogens, and at least one study has shown that the coronavirus provokes a strong response from these cells. So-called memory cells, or B cells, may also kick into gear when they encounter the coronavirus, churning out more antibodies.
Ultimately, however, the answer to how long immunity lasts will come only with patience.“Unless someone has come up with some way to speed that process up,” Dr. Rasmussen said, “the only way to tell that is by following these patients over time.”"

A novel respiratory virus that originated in Wuhan, China, last December has spread to six continents. Hundreds of thousands have been infected, at least 20,000 people have died and the spread of the coronavirus was called a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March. 
Much remains unknown about the virus, including how many people may have very mild or asymptomatic infections, and whether they can transmit the virus. The precise dimensions of the outbreak are hard to know. 
Here’s what scientists have learned so far about the virus and the outbreak.What is a coronavirus?
Coronaviruses are named for the spikes that protrude from their surfaces, resembling a crown or the sun’s corona. They can infect both animals and people, and can cause illnesses of the respiratory tract. 
At least four types of coronaviruses cause very mild infections every year, like the common cold. Most people get infected with one or more of these viruses at some point in their lives. 
Another coronavirus that circulated in China in 2003 caused a more dangerous condition known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS. The virus was contained after it had sickened 8,098 people and killed 774. 
Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012, is also caused by a coronavirus.
The new virus has been named SARS-CoV-2. The disease it causes is called Covid-19. How dangerous is it?It is hard to accurately assess the lethality of a new virus. It appears to be less often fatal than the coronaviruses that caused SARS or MERS, but significantly more so than the seasonal flu. The fatality rate was over 2 percent, in one study. But government scientists have estimated that the real figure could be below 1 percent, roughly the rate occurring in a severe flu season.
About 5 percent of the patients who were hospitalized in China had critical illnesses. Children seem less likely to be infected with the new coronavirus, while middle-aged and older adults are disproportionately infected. 
Men are more likely to die from an infection compared to women, possibly because they produce weaker immune responses and have higher rates of tobacco consumption, Type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure than women, which may increase the risk of complications following an infection.
“This is a pattern we’ve seen with many viral infections of the respiratory tract — men can have worse outcomes,” said Sabra Klein, a scientist who studies sex differences in viral infections and vaccination responses at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
How is the new coronavirus transmitted?Experts believe that an infected animal may have first transmitted the virus to humans at a market that sold live fish, animals and birds in Wuhan. The market was later shut down and disinfected, making it nearly impossible to investigate which animal may have been the exact origin.  
Bats are considered a possible source, because they have evolved to coexist with many viruses, and they were found to be the starting point for SARS. It is also possible that bats transmitted the virus to an intermediate animal, such as pangolins, which are consumed as a delicacy in parts of China, and may have then passed on the virus to humans. 
The outbreak grew because of human-to-human transmission. 
People infected with the virus produce tiny respiratory droplets when they breathe, talk, cough or sneeze, allowing the virus to travel through the air. 
Most respiratory droplets fall to the ground within a few feet. People who are in close contact with those infected, particularly family members and health care workers, may catch the virus this way. 
Scientists don’t know how long the new coronavirus can live on surfaces, and preliminary research suggests that hot and humid environments may not slow down the pathogen’s spread. Warm weather does tend to inhibit influenza and milder coronaviruses. 
Infected people may be able to pass on the new coronavirus even if they have few obvious symptoms, a study in Germany has found. That’s “bad news,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an expert in infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. 
When people don’t know they are infected, “they’re up and about, going to work or the gym or to religious services, and breathing on or near other people,” he said. Still, a report by the World Health Organization suggests that asymptomatic cases are rare. 

What symptoms should I look out for?Symptoms of this infection include fever, cough and difficulty breathing or shortness of breath. The illness causes lung lesions and pneumonia. But milder cases may resemble the flu or a bad cold, making detection difficult.
Patients may exhibit other symptoms, too, such as gastrointestinal problems or diarrhea. Current estimates suggest that symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after being exposed to the virus.
If you have a fever or a cough and recently visited China, South Korea, Italy or another place with a known coronavirus outbreak, or spent time with someone who did, see your health care provider. Call first, so the office can prepare for your visit and take steps to protect other patients and staff from potential exposure.
Is there a test for the virus? What is the treatment? There is a diagnostic test that can determine if you are infected. It was developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, based on genetic information about the virus provided by the Chinese authorities. 
In early February, the C.D.C. sent diagnostic test kits to 200 state laboratories, but some of the kits were flawed and recalled. Now other laboratories are making their own tests. Other countries are using test kits manufactured locally or sent out by the W.H.O.
The C.D.C. announced that anyone who wanted to be tested could, if a doctor approves the request. Private companies, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, are also rushing to provide tests at various labs across the country, but the supply has yet to meet public demand. Many patients complain that they still cannot get tested. 

Once a coronavirus infection is confirmed, the treatment is mainly supportive,  making sure the patient is getting enough oxygen, managing his or her fever and using a ventilator to push air into the lungs if necessary, said Dr. Julie Vaishampayan, chairwoman of the public health committee at the Infectious Diseases Society of America.
Patients with mild cases are told to rest and drink plenty of fluids “while the immune system does its job and heals itself,” she said. Most people with mild infections recover in about two weeks. More than half of those who have been infected globally have already  recovered.
A number of drugs are currently being tested as potential treatments, including  an antiviral medication called remdesivir, which appears to be effective in animals and was used to treat the first American patient in Washington State. The National Institutes of Health is testing the drug on infected patient in a clinical trial in Nebraska. The drug’s maker, Gilead, has also begun trials at various sites in Asia.
How long will it take to develop a vaccine?A coronavirus vaccine is still months away — and perhaps years. While new technology, advancements in genomics and improved global coordination have allowed researchers to act quickly, vaccine development remains an expensive and risky process.
After the SARS outbreak in 2003, it took researchers about 20 months to get a vaccine ready for human trials. (The vaccine was never needed, because the disease was eventually contained.) 
By the time of the Zika outbreak in 2015, researchers had brought the vaccine development timeline down to six months.
Now, they hope that work from past outbreaks will help cut the timeline further. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health and several companies are working on vaccine candidates.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said a preliminary clinical trial might get off the ground in as little as three months. But researchers would still need to conduct extensive testing to prove a vaccine was safe and effective. 
How can I protect myself?The best thing you can do to avoid getting infected is to follow the same general guidelines that experts recommend during flu season, because the coronavirus spreads in much the same way. Wash your hands frequently throughout the day. Avoid touching your face, and maintain a distance — at least six feet — from anyone who is coughing or sneezing.
The risk of infection with the new coronavirus in the United States “is way too low for the general public to start wearing a face mask,” said Dr. Peter Rabinowitz, co-director of the University of Washington MetaCenter for Pandemic Preparedness and Global Health Security. 
But, he added, “if you have symptoms of a respiratory illness, wearing a mask reduces the risk of infecting others.”
Should I cancel my international travel plans?Many countries have also enacted travel restrictions and bans, closing their doors to people from countries with sustained transmission of the virus. Governments around the world have been screening incoming passengers for signs of illness. 
Is it too late to contain the virus? W.H.O. officials have credited lockdown measures China imposed in late January for averting the spread of more cases from Wuhan. China sealed off cities, shut down businesses and schools, and ordered residents to remain in their homes. Officials use cellphone data to track and intercept those who have been to Hubei Province.
In recent weeks, government workers have gone door-to-door to round up people who are infected, placing them in stadiums and other buildings that have been converted to makeshift hospitals. Now, official reports suggest that new cases in China are waning. 
But there is growing fear that containment may no longer be possible. Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of infectious diseases at the School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore, said the surge of cases in multiple countries was “concerning because we know the transmissions are spreading at a fast rate.”
“We’ve learned some things of this new virus for the past couple of weeks that make it seem unlikely that containment will be a strategy that will completely stop this virus,” he added.
There is benefit to delaying its spread as long as possible. Containing the virus may buy health officials more time to stock hospitals with test kits and respirators, and for local governments, companies and schools to enact strategies — telecommuting and online classes, for instance — that may reduce the spread.
But the ability of nations to prepare for the arrival of coronavirus cases will depend largely on the strength of their health systems, capacity to conduct tests and effectiveness in communicating updates to the public.
“We have been dealing with flu for decades, and even now it seems some countries don’t even have a policy for influenza preparedness,” said Leo Poon, head of the University of Hong Kong’s public health laboratory sciences division. “Not to mention something which is new to them. That’s a problem.”

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday announced a national initiative to speed research into how the coronavirus was spreading around the country, bringing together at least 75 public health, academic and commercial institutions studying its genome.
As the virus replicates, tiny mutations accumulate in its genetic code. Those differences help scientists trace patterns of transmission and investigate outbreaks. They also provide an understanding of how the virus is evolving, which can affect the accuracy of diagnostic tests and the effectiveness of treatments and vaccines.
Historically, laboratories studying the genomes of pathogens released only general information about them, often in academic journals. Patient privacy laws in some states also limited the details they could provide. But that began to change in recent years with food-borne illnesses, as officials realized that publicly sharing gene sequences allowed scientists to find links with greater speed and react to save lives.
Gene sequences are also shared to help track influenza, and officials used them to respond to Ebola outbreaks in West Africa several years ago and, more recently, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.
The new effort, announced by the C.D.C. on its website, builds on that approach. Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the C.D.C.’s director, said in a statement that he was confident the country’s “finest, most skilled minds are working together to help us save lives today and tomorrow.”
“The U.S. is the world’s leader in advanced rapid genome sequencing. This coordinated effort across our public, private, clinical and academic public health laboratories will play a vital role in understanding the transmission, evolution and treatment of SARS-CoV-2,” he said, using the technical name for the virus that causes Covid-19.
Participating labs have pledged to release their information into the public domain quickly and in a standard way, as part of an initiative called Spheres. (The project’s name is an acronym: Sequencing for Public Health Emergency Response, Epidemiology and Surveillance.) The sequences they share will be used for surveillance, emergency response and applied research, according to the federal agency.
Pavitra Roychoudhury, a scientist with the University of Washington’s virology department and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, is helping to coordinate her institutions’ work with Spheres. She said in an email that the project, which launched in early April before being announced, had already “made a tangible impact in the number of sequences we’re able to deposit and make publicly available on a daily basis.”
She and her colleagues, as well as researchers at some other laboratories, have been sequencing samples for months, providing insights into the origins and spread of the virus in the United States. “We’ve been sharing what we’ve learned” with others in the consortium, she said.
Sequences themselves mean little without context. The consortium aims to standardize what information should accompany each sequence, such as where and when a sample was taken, critically important details to make use of the data. Dr. Roychoudhury said the group was having conversations about how it could present the data in a way that helps “researchers around the world who may want to use it to design vaccines and therapies.”
Other countries have announced similar efforts. Britain established a sequencing consortium more than a month ago funded at about $25 million, and last week, Canada did the same, pledging about $30 million in government support. A C.D.C. spokeswoman said the U.S. project’s funding was “being worked out.”
The effort is based in the C.D.C.’s Office of Advanced Molecular Detection. Duncan MacCannell, the unit’s chief science officer, said that genomic sequencing and related technologies had “fundamentally changed how public health responds in terms of surveillance and outbreak response.”
He said many members of the consortium were new to the field and were not traditional participants in public health efforts. They “were starting to sequence,” he said, and “needed some coordination.”
Some public health laboratories are doing rapid and focused work, applying their findings to investigations on the ground and helping guide infection control. Other laboratories involved in the new group, such as LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics, have a large national reach, allowing for broader studies that could help officials understand the transmission of the virus and its prevalence in the population over time.
Dr. MacCannell said the United States would coordinate its efforts with international partners, including in regions of the world where there were fewer resources for testing."
27,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/06/well/live/coronavirus-cleaning-cleaners-disinfectants-home.html,The New York Times,2020-05-06,['Tara Parker-Pope'],Have I Been Cleaning All Wrong?,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/04/well/well-cleaning/well-cleaning-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
Ever since the coronavirus became a threat, many of us are doing a lot more cleaning at home, spraying and wiping pretty much everything in sight, especially high-touch surfaces like door knobs and faucet handles. 
But many of us are used to giving a surface a quick spray, followed by a wipe or two, which may not allow enough time for the product to work. And once you start reading labels on cleaning products closely, it gets really confusing. Several readers pointed out that disinfectant wipes and spray cleaners have different instructions on their labels for how long a cleaner should stay on a surface to effectively kill germs, ranging from 30 seconds to four minutes or even as long as 10 minutes. What’s more, some labels recommend cleaning before using a disinfectant.
So what’s the right way to clean? We talked to infectious disease scientists and microbiologists who study and test cleaning products to answer your questions about cleaning in the time of coronavirus. The bottom line: Whether you’re worried about coronavirus or other germs that lurk in our homes, many of us are cleaning too fast for the disinfectant to do its job.
Here’s what the experts said.How long does a disinfectant need to stay on a surface in order to kill germs?You probably need to let your disinfectant stay on the surface you’re cleaning for far longer than you think.
“The longer you can let it be in contact, the better,” said Dr. Andrew Janowski, instructor of pediatric infectious diseases at Washington University School of Medicine St. Louis Children’s Hospital. “What I’ve been doing at home: I wait roughly a minute if I’m applying a spray product and then wiping.”
To find out how long the recommended time is for a specific product, check the label. The guidance could range from 30 seconds to several minutes of contact time before you wipe. Note that some products may claim to sanitize, which means they reduce the level of certain bacteria, but not viruses. A disinfectant claim means the product destroys or inactivates both the bacteria and viruses noted on the label.
Even cleaners from the same brand have different contact times. My bottle of Clorox bleach says five minutes of contact time, while Clorox Clean-Up Cleaner + Bleach advises 30 seconds. Clorox Anywhere Hard Surface says two minutes (but it promises to kill only bacteria, not viruses), while Clorox Disinfecting Wipes says four minutes. Even among similar Lysol branded wipes, the recommended contact time varies — the lavender scented wipe recommends 10 minutes of contact time, whereas the lemon-lime scented wipe says four minutes.
Why are the recommended contact times so different? It depends on which bacteria and viruses the product claims to kill. To make a disinfectant claim, a product has to go through a strict testing process set forth by a country’s regulatory agencies. In the United States, it’s the Environmental Protection Agency. To test a disinfectant, scientists cover a surface with a large dose of the organism being studied. They then douse the surface with a disinfectant and let it sit for a set amount of time before testing to determine whether any of the organisms remain viable.
Those tests are essentially worst-case scenarios using excessively high concentrations of germs — about 100,000 organisms per centimeter — which is far more than would typically be found in a home setting. “Most common surfaces in homes and hospitals have less than 100 organisms per square centimeter,” said Dr. David Weber, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
But even though the contact time advice is probably overkill, to be certain a surface has been completely disinfected, you should pay attention to the disinfection time recommendations on the label, especially when someone in the house has been sick. In some cases, organism contamination can reach very high levels in a home — like when you are working with raw chicken in a kitchen or when someone in the house is ill and an area has been contaminated with stool or vomit. And some organisms, like norovirus, which causes severe gastrointestinal symptoms, are particularly tough to eliminate and can cause illness in infinitesimal doses.
Why does the label say a surface has to be cleaned before using a disinfectant? Do I really have to clean twice?If your surface is covered in crumbs, grime or spilled food, then yes, you do need to clean away the debris and dirt before using a disinfectant.
“For a germicide to work, it has to touch the germs,” said Dr. Weber, who has consulted for PDI, a firm that makes disinfectants. “If you have a layer of grime, the dirt can protect the bacteria. Cleaning has to precede disinfection.”
Some cleaners promise to both clean and disinfect, but even those labels advise pre-cleaning a heavily soiled surface.
The label on my disinfectant wipes says I should use them for four minutes. Do I really have to wipe that long?When wipes are tested in laboratory conditions, the clock starts with the first wipe and continues until the surface dries. So you don’t have to wipe for a full four minutes (or whatever time is advised on the label). The goal is for the wiping time and drying time to last four minutes, says Haley Oliver, a microbiologist and associate professor of food science at Purdue University.
In a recent study of disinfectant wipes, Dr. Oliver and colleagues tested a six-inch formica square covered with Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. The surface was wiped four times with a disinfectant wipe and left to dry. Five out of six products tested remained wet on the surface until the label contact time was reached. One product dried 15 seconds too soon, but it still worked well against germs.
“I think being conscious of contact time is important,” says Dr. Oliver, whose research includes work with Diversy, a major producer of cleaning and disinfectant products. “If this is my house and I’m on a wipe campaign, I want to see that the wipe deposited liquid on that surface.”
I often use one wipe to clean multiple surfaces. Should I use a new wipe each time so I don’t spread germs?You can use one wipe to clean multiple surfaces. As long as the wipe remains wet, an indication that it still has plenty of cleaner on it, you don’t have to worry about spreading organisms around. That said, most experts I spoke with prefer not to mix rooms. So they would use one wipe on multiple surfaces in a bathroom, for example, but they wouldn’t use that same wipe in the kitchen.
Dr. Oliver notes that there isn’t official guidance on how much surface area one wipe can cover. The key to disinfecting with wipes is to be aware when your wipe is running out of disinfectant. “If it’s not wet, then you’re not contacting microbes with the chemistry that was intended,” says Dr. Oliver. “If you’ve run out of the ingredient and your towelette is dry, you could be transmitting those organisms around.”
What’s the best cleaner to get rid of coronavirus?Product labels will say specifically what types of bacteria and viruses have been tested. But because SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is so new, most cleaning products haven’t been tested against it. The E.P.A. has, however, published a list of products expected to kill the virus because they are proven against harder-to-kill viruses or other types of coronavirus.
The good news is that the new coronavirus is actually much easier to kill than many of the organisms previously studied. So it is likely that even if you haven’t been following the contact time recommendations for disinfectants, you have probably been killing the virus. But you need to follow label direction to tackle harder-to-kill germs like E. coli, salmonella or staph.
“It’s important to note that these recommendations are generic and typically based on how long it takes to kill bacteria — for example, Staph and Strep, which are much harder to kill than a virus like SARS-CoV-2,” said Dr. Daniel R. Kuritzkes, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and professor at Harvard Medical School. “Shorter times of exposure are most likely still quite effective to prevent Covid-19.”

Laundromats have been deemed essential businesses in cities and states that have issued stay-at-home orders to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. But many laundry business owners have chosen to close for the safety of their employees, leaving those who rely on laundromats without access to washing machines and dryers.
Even if your local laundromat is still operating, you may choose to wash clothes at home to avoid being exposed to other people. Here’s how to do it.
Prepare your stationStep 1First, you’ll need to determine where this operation will take place: Washing clothes by hand requires a clean space roomy enough to fully submerge your garments in water. For most people, the kitchen sink will be the best place for hand laundering, but a utility sink, a roomy bathroom sink, the bathtub or a washing basin are also options.
Clean the sink with an all-purpose cleaner and fill it with water, leaving enough room for your clothes and hands to move around inside. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s current recommendations regarding laundry and coronavirus are to use the hottest water temperature a garment can tolerate. (Check the label.) And you can wear gloves if it’s more comfortable.
sudsStep 2Add 1 teaspoon of regular liquid or powder detergent for each pound of clothing you wash. (Neil Lant, a research fellow at Procter & Gamble who is focused on fabric care, said that on average three items of adult-sized clothing weigh about a pound.) Be careful not to use too much detergent, as it will make the rinsing process exceedingly long and is likely to leave behind residue that can cause skin irritation.
A no-rinse detergent like Soak Wash is a great option because it removes a step from the process. You should never puncture a detergent pack for hand laundering; the detergent that is sold in packs is highly concentrated, and it poses a risk if it comes in contact with the eye, either from being squirted out of a pack or from the detergent being transferred from the hands to the eyes.
While detergents designed specifically for hand laundering provide easy-to-follow dosage guidelines, it can be trickier to determine how much regular laundry detergent to use.
SwirlStep 3Add clothes to the detergent solution and submerge them fully. Use your hands to mimic the agitation of a washing machine. Move the garments by swirling and pumping them in the detergent solution so that it can penetrate the fibers.
SoakStep 4Once the garments are submerged, allow them to soak in the solution for 15 to 60 minutes, depending on how visibly dirty the fabric is.
DRAIN AND RINSEStep 5Drain the detergent solution and wipe the sink free of any suds, then refill the sink with clean cool or lukewarm water to begin rinsing. Using your hands, agitate the clothes to release detergent, draining the water and repeating until they are fully rinsed. Sturdier fibers like polyester and cotton can be rinsed directly under running water, though you should avoid rinsing delicate items like hosiery or fine scarves directly under a running tap.
DryStep 6After the final rinse, drain the sink, move the clothing to one side and, one by one, press down on each garment to extrude the water held in its fibers. Do not wring the fibers, which can cause stretching or other damage. The first press, so to speak (it’s like making wine!), is just with hands, in the sink, to push out as much water as possible without wringing.
If you have a clean, dry towel to spare, lay the clothing flat on the towel and roll the towel and piece of clothing up together, jelly roll style. The combination of pressing out the water and rolling the item in a dry towel will leave it only damp, rather than dripping wet, which will speed up drying time. If you don’t have a clean towel to spare, but you do have a salad spinner, it can be used to extrude water from smaller items like socks, underwear or T-shirts.
Allow the clothing to air dry by laying it flat, using a drying rack or line drying it if that is an option.
As far as outdoor drying goes, the same rules apply as for exposure to people, said Vineet Menachery, a virologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch. If the clothes are more than 6 feet away from an infected person’s sneezing or coughing droplets, they are safe to line dry.
“It is unlikely coronavirus is floating through the air outside,” said Dr. Menachery. “Now if your neighbor is sick and coughs out the window less than 6 feet away from you hanging clothes, then they might be contaminated.”
Christian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, echoed that opinion in an email: “The coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) is not airborne. It is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors or surfaces.”
If you do not have a drying rack or if space in your home is limited, wet clothes can be put on plastic hangers and hung from a shower curtain rod to drip-dry.
Tips and tricksCheck the weather and, if you have outdoor space, do your wash on a dry day. Even if you will be drying clothes indoors, lower air-moisture levels will help your items dry faster.Working in small batches — 3 to 4 days worth of clothes — will make the process much easier, and will not leave every surface of your home covered in drip-drying pieces.Bulky items like towels and sheets can be difficult to wash and even more difficult to dry, especially for those without access to outdoor space for line dying. Instead of washing them, spot treat any stains and then steam them, which will freshen and clean them. You can also extend bed linen use by laundering pillowcases only, which are smaller and less cumbersome to wash and dry by hand."

The researchers worked around the clock, in shifts of three to five hours, hoping to stave off weariness and keep their minds sharp for the delicate task.
They set up lines of laboratory volunteers: medical residents, postdoctoral students, even experienced veterans of science, each handling a specific task. They checked and rechecked their data, as if the world were depending on it. Because in some ways, it is.
For the past few weeks, more than 50 scientists have been working diligently to do something that the Food and Drug Administration mostly has not: Verifying that 14 coronavirus antibody tests now on the market actually deliver accurate results.
These tests are crucial to reopening the economy, but public health experts have raised urgent concerns about their quality. The new research, completed just days ago and posted online Friday, confirmed some of those fears: Of the 14 tests, only three delivered consistently reliable results. Even the best had some flaws.
The research has not been peer-reviewed and is subject to revision. But the results are already raising difficult questions about the course of the epidemic.
Surveys of residents in the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York this week found that substantial percentages tested positive for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, the official name of the new coronavirus. In New York City, the figure was said to be as high as 21 percent. Elsewhere, it was closer to 3 percent.
The idea that many residents in some parts of the country have already been exposed to the virus has wide implications. At the least, the finding could greatly complicate plans to reopen the economy.
Already Americans are scrambling to take antibody tests to see if they might escape lockdowns. Public health experts are wondering if those with positive results might be allowed to return to work.
But these tactics mean nothing if the test results can’t be trusted.In the new research, researchers found that only one of the tests never delivered a so-called false positive — that is, it never mistakenly signaled antibodies in people who did not have them.
Two other tests did not deliver false-positive results 99 percent of the time.But the converse was not true. Even these three tests detected antibodies in infected people only 90 percent of the time, at best.
The false-positive metric is particularly important. The result may lead people to believe themselves immune to the virus when they are not, and to put themselves in danger by abandoning social distancing and other protective measures.
It is also the result on which scientists are most divided.“There are multiple tests that look reasonable and promising,” said Dr. Alexander Marson, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and one of the project’s leaders. “That’s some reason for optimism.”
Dr. Marson is also an investigator in the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, which partly funded the study.Other scientists were less sanguine than Dr. Marson. Four of the tests produced false-positive rates ranging from 11 percent to 16 percent; many of the rest hovered around 5 percent.
“Those numbers are just unacceptable,” said Scott Hensley, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania. “The tone of the paper is, ‘Look how good the tests are.’ But I look at these data, and I don’t really see that.”
The proportion of people in the United States who have been exposed to the coronavirus is likely to be 5 percent or less, Dr. Hensley said. “If your kit has a 3 percent false-positive, how do you interpret that? It’s basically impossible,” he said. “If your kit has 14 percent false positive, it’s useless.”
Dr. Hensley said the study nonetheless was well designed and the results pressing, given the sudden proliferation of antibody tests on the market and the push to use them to lift lockdowns.
“I think this is exactly the kind of study that we need right now,” he said.Dr. Marson and his colleagues said they were drawn to the study for that very reason.
As universities in the Bay Area shut down all research not related to the coronavirus, some researchers began focusing on ways to improve diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2.
Dr. Marson and his collaborator, Patrick Hsu, a bioengineer at the University of California, Berkeley, anticipated that antibody tests would also face questions about quality.
In mid-March, Dr. Hsu heard that a friend, a venture capitalist who owns a network of 1,000 community clinics in the New York area, had ordered thousands of rapid antibody tests. Investors and entrepreneurs seemed to be distributing them around San Francisco, too.
“I realized, ‘Gosh this is really the Wild West,’” Dr. Hsu said. “We needed to figure out which of these would really work.”
The duo recruited Dr. Jeffrey Whitman and Dr. Caryn Bern, who last year published an analysis of antibody tests for Chagas disease. Other graduate students and postdoctoral fellows volunteered to help perform the evaluations.
The team began with a modified version of the method Dr. Whitman had devised to validate Chagas tests. The researchers created a biosafety-certified space, obtained the needed approvals and procured hundreds of blood samples from two Bay Area hospitals.
They also purchased tests from Chinese manufacturers, clearing customs regulations and sometimes accepting Uber deliveries in the middle of the night.
In all, the investigators analyzed 10 rapid tests that deliver a yes-no signal for antibodies, and two tests using a lab technique known as Elisa that indicate the amount of antibodies present and are generally considered to be more reliable.
Suited up in protective gear, the team worked in shifts of three to five hours in a sort of socially distanced factory line.
One researcher spotted the test with a blood sample, and another added the necessary chemical solutions; then two independent readers looked at the test, and a last person recorded the results. Still other team members analyzed the results, sometimes working through the night.
In the early hours of recent mornings, they handed the baton to Dr. Tyler Miller and his colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital, who were conducting a slightly different analysis of three tests, including one evaluated in San Francisco.
The Bay Area team finished evaluating 12 tests in record time, less than a month. By comparison, the Chagas project required a team of three people working for more than a year just to compare four tests.
Having a study design already in hand helped speed the work, but there was one key difference. Decades of data have shown that Chagas disease elicits lifelong immunity. For this study, the team had no idea how quickly SARS-CoV-2 antibodies might turn up in the blood, or at what levels.
[Like the Science Times page on Facebook.| Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]New tests also usually compete with an established gold standard. Lacking such a standard, the team instead compared all the tests in a “head-to-head bake-off to see who’s the winner,” Dr. Hsu said.
Each test was evaluated with the same set of blood samples: from 80 people known to be infected with the coronavirus, at different points after infection; 108 samples donated before the pandemic; and 52 samples from people who were positive for other viral infections but had tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
Tests made by Sure Biotech and Wondfo Biotech, along with an in-house Elisa test, produced the fewest false positives.
A test made by Bioperfectus detected antibodies in 100 percent of the infected samples, but only after three weeks of infection. None of the tests did better than 80 percent until that time period, which was longer than expected, Dr. Hsu said.
The lesson is that the tests are less likely to produce false negatives the longer ago the initial infection occurred, he said.
The tests were particularly variable when looking for a transient antibody that comes up soon after infection, called IgM, and more consistent in identifying a subsequent antibody, called IgG, that may signal longer-term immunity.
“You can see that antibody levels rise at different points for every patient,” Dr. Hsu said. The tests performed best when the researchers assessed both types of antibodies together. None of the tests could say whether the presence of these antibodies means a person is protected from reinfection, however.
The results overall are promising, Dr. Marson added. “There are multiple tests that have specificities greater than 95 percent.”
Rapid antibody tests are generally used to get a simple yes-no result, but the team assigned the positive results — which appear as bands on a test strip — a score from zero to six. They trained readers to interpret those results, and found their decisions often agreed and were supported by the more quantitative Elisa tests.
“If you train the readers well, they can start to be reliable,” Dr. Marson said of rapid tests. “That is critical to understand if these tests could ever be deployed.”
The team at Mass General set a higher bar for specificity; they considered a score of one for the intensity of a band to be a negative result, rather than a score of zero.
Perhaps because they eliminated the fainter bands — the ones most likely to be erroneous — their estimate of specificity for BioMedomics, the one test that was evaluated by both teams, was more than 99 percent, compared with the San Francisco team’s estimate of 87 percent.
Other experts were skeptical of the scoring approach, however. “That’s not really a method that would give you a real quantitation,” said Florian Krammer of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.
Dr. Krammer has developed a two-step Elisa test that he said has 100 percent specificity and delivers a measure of the quantity of IgM and IgG antibodies a person has. Scoring a rapid test’s bands might offer some data for a scientific study, he said, “but I would not make any decisions based on that.”
Dr. Krammer said false positives are less of an issue for assessing how widely the virus has spread in the population. If a test has a known false-positive rate, scientists can factor that into their calculations, he said.
But false positives become dangerous when making policy and personal decisions about who can go back to work. “You don’t want anybody back to work who has a false positive — that’s the last thing you want to do,” Dr. Krammer said.
Scanwell Health, a Los Angeles-based start-up, has ordered millions of test kits from Innovita, a Chinese manufacturer, and has applied to the Food and Drug Administration to market the tests for at-home use.
In the new study, the Innovita test detected antibodies in 83 percent of infected people and yielded a false-positive rate of 4 percent.
Dr. Jack Jeng, chief medical officer of Scanwell Health, said the study looked at an earlier version of Innovita’s test and not the “newer, improved version” his company had ordered. “It will be interesting to see how it performs,” he said.
Dr. Marson and his colleagues have acquired tests from nearly 100 manufacturers, and plan to continue comparing them. The scientists also hope to expand their sample set to include people who were mildly ill or did not feel ill at all, and to stratify their data by age and the presence of chronic conditions.
“This is just the beginning,” Dr. Marson said. “Our goal would be to keep going till we feel there’s adequate supply in the market.”"

Was She Sick Enough to Stay Home?,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/05/magazine/05mag-diagnosis1/05mag-diagnosis1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
“I don’t know what you’re feeling,” the supervising doctor said over the phone, his voice calm and reassuring. “But based on the text you sent me, you shouldn’t go to work.” The 29-year-old woman, an anesthesiology resident in her second year of training, breathed a sigh of relief. “Now,” the training-program director continued, “tell me what’s going on.”
Two days earlier, on March 14, the young doctor finished her sixth straight day of 12-hour shifts in the surgical intensive care unit in her hospital in Boston. She was exhausted, but that wasn’t unusual. Yet when she woke up the next day, her only day off, she didn’t feel well. It wasn’t much — a queasy stomach, a little headache and brain fog. Her muscles were sore, as if she had lifted weights the day before. And when she took a deep breath, her chest felt strangely tight. She figured that she was just recovering from what had been a really tough week.
The following day, she felt fine when her alarm went off at 5 a.m. She got to the hospital by 6, but before the day started, she was told she wasn’t needed. All elective surgery had been postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic, and so there weren’t many patients in the surgical I.C.U. She and her co-resident made a deal: Her colleague would care for their patients that day, and she’d take over the next.
Later that day, the subtle symptoms from the day before worsened. She didn’t feel sick exactly, just not like herself. She had been training for the Boston Marathon, before it was rescheduled for September, and she decided to go for a run. She finished her six-mile loop with no trouble, but she still felt a little off. Was she getting sick? Her husband, a doctor at the same hospital, didn’t feel sick, either, but for the past couple of days, he had a cough. Could this be Covid-19, the respiratory infection caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 — the virus that was sweeping across the United States and much of the rest of the world?
Typical SymptomsFrom what she had read, that infection usually caused a fever, cough and shortness of breath. The young doctor had none of those. She had a bit of chest tightness, but it didn’t make her feel out of breath. She fretted about it all afternoon and deep into the evening. When she came across a story online about an emergency-room doctor who had symptoms like hers and tested positive for Covid-19, she made her decision and texted the director of her residency program. He called her right back.
“Stay home, and get tested,” he told her. The next day, she was tested. By then, her headache was a little worse. Her muscles ached a little more. She spent much of the day in bed. Her husband’s symptoms didn’t change; he still had the same dry cough. Neither of them had a fever. Two days later, she felt fine; not 100 percent but close. She went for her usual run.
Guilt Sets InGiven how well she now felt, the young doctor wondered: Had she called in sick for a headache, unnecessarily increasing the workload on her fellow residents? There’s an informal motto that says a doctor should either “round or be rounded on.” You are well enough to work until you are sick enough to be in the hospital as a patient. A doctor should put patient care above everything else. A 2012 study found that more than half of all residents surveyed admitted to going to work when they were sick with flulike symptoms.
And yet she knew that to go to work with even the slightest chance of a Covid-19 infection would be irresponsible. She hoped that the test would be positive — that she was right to call in sick even though she wasn’t very sick.
It took four days for the results to come back. A nurse from her hospital called to let her know: She’d tested positive for Covid-19. Her husband, who hadn’t been tested, probably had the virus as well. Both of them would need to stay home for at least one week after the start of their symptoms, the nurse instructed. And before going back to work, both would have to have a negative test result.
A Sense of VindicationAfter the phone call, the young woman was overwhelmed with relief. Later that morning, the head of her residency program called. How would she feel about letting her colleagues know about her diagnosis? This way they might feel better about calling in sick if they had symptoms that didn’t seem that bad. Remembering how important the story about the E.R. doctor had been in her own decision, she immediately agreed. She’d already called the people she interacted with on her last morning at work.
In an email, she described her symptoms and the anxiety she had about calling in sick. “It can be tough to stay home, especially at a time like this, but it’s the best thing that we can do to keep our patients, families and each other safe,” she wrote. Once she hit send, she felt a sense of satisfaction, she told me. But that night, although she believed she was done with this virus, she found that it wasn’t done with her.
Unexpected New SymptomsOn March 21, a week after her first symptoms, the young resident was reading a book when suddenly she felt as if her chest was squeezed tight, as if there was a band restricting the expansion of her ribs and lungs. She’d never felt anything like it before, and it scared her. She stood and felt lightheaded. “I don’t feel good,” she said to her husband. “I can’t breathe.” The suddenness with which this came on argued against its being a pneumonia. Could this be a panic attack? She tried taking deep breaths and relaxing. It didn’t help. She needed to go to the E.R., she told him. She put on a face mask, and the couple headed to the hospital where they worked. The woman fought against a rising sense of panic. Every stoplight seemed torture. There were reports of this virus causing sudden death. Was she dying? Would it just keep getting harder to breathe?
In the emergency room, her heart was beating faster than normal, and she was breathing rapidly, but her oxygen level was fine. “Don’t leave me alone,” she pleaded with her husband and the nurse who took her to a negative-pressure room.
Over the course of the next couple of hours, blood tests were done, and an EKG and X-ray were performed. Her doctors wanted to make sure she didn’t have something on top of her known viral infection. One blood test looked for an increase in white blood cells in her circulation — a sign of a possible bacterial infection. It was normal. The other tests were equally unrevealing. The EKG showed no evidence of heart damage. The chest X-ray showed no sign of a pneumonia. The weight on the young woman’s chest didn’t get better, but it got no worse. Early reports of Covid-19 cases in China showed that some patients who already had serious symptoms suddenly got worse a week or more into their illness, a so-called second-week crash. It’s still not clear exactly what might be causing this late exacerbation. After promising the doctors she’d come back if she felt any worse, the young doctor and her husband went home.
Getting Back to WorkI spoke with the patient on March 26, and she told me she was feeling better. She gets a little out of breath when she climbs the four flights of stairs to her apartment, but even that is improving.
Right now, she’s focused on going back to work — she recently tested negative. Although no one knows for certain if getting the infection provides long-term immunity, current thinking is that she is probably immune to the virus for now. She is eager to return to the fight and, given the proper equipment, is ready to take her place at the very front lines of this war."

Syria’s Kurdish northeast had its first Covid-19 death. The case was news to the Kurds. 
The Kurdish-led administration that governs northeastern Syria announced on Friday the first death in that region from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. As it turns out, the World Health Organization knew about the case for more than 11 days before informing the local authorities, a W.H.O. official said.
The W.H.O. official and the Kurdish administration, which oversees about one-third of Syria’s territory along the Turkish and Iraqi borders, said a 53-year-old man was admitted to a hospital on March 27. Doctors ran a test for the coronavirus and sent it to the Syrian capital, Damascus, for analysis.
The man died on April 2, the same day that his test came back positive. The authorities in Damascus, which has a hostile relationship with the Kurds, did not pass along that information.
The W.H.O. official, Rick Brennan, the regional emergency director for the eastern Mediterranean, said in an interview that the Syrian authorities informed the organization of  the case on April 5, but because of “internal procedural problems and miscommunication,” it did not get word to the Kurds about it until Thursday — 11 days later.
The case illustrates how the political divisions left by Syria’s long civil war could hinder a response if a major outbreak occurs. The government of President Bashar al-Assad in Damascus controls most of the country, but has hostile relations with both the Kurdish-led administration that governs the northeast and the leaders of a rebel-held enclave in Idlib Province in the northwest.
Syria has reported only 38 cases of coronavirus and two deaths, but aid groups have warned that the virus could do great damage. Millions of Syrians have been displaced and impoverished through nine years of war, and much of the country’s health infrastructure has been badly damaged.
In a statement Friday, the Kurdish-led administration said it would hold the W.H.O. responsible if the virus spread in its area.
Mr. Brennan said that the man who died had no travel history and no known contact with other infected people — indicating that there are almost certainly other, undiagnosed cases in the area.
Germany’s infection rate falls, a sign that it is getting the virus under control.
As Germany moves to ease restrictions under the pandemic, its public health institute said the country’s rate of coronavirus spread had dropped below a crucial threshold, a sign that the contagion was coming under control.
On average, each infected person is spreading the virus to 0.7 other people, officials said. That means that fewer people are catching the virus than are getting over it.
As long as the figure stays below one, the number of active cases is declining, and the burden on the health care system is easing.
“Since April 12, we have recorded more recoveries than new infections,” Jens Spahn, Germany’s health minister, said at a news conference on Friday. “That is an important and encouraging development.”
Scientists around the world have estimated that without social distancing, quarantines of the ill and other precautions, each person with the new virus would give it to about two others — a formula for exponential growth.
This week, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced the first steps to ease restrictions, allowing some stores to reopen on Monday and high school students to return to classrooms to prepare for or take exams. The eastern state of Saxony is requiring  people who go out in public to cover their noses and mouths either with masks or a shawl.
The lower infection rate does not mean that Germans can return to their pre-coronavirus lifestyles, said Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, the government’s public health and epidemiology center. 
He cautioned that in some parts of Germany, the infection rate remained much higher, and stressed that the rate is only one point in a range of data being continually assessed to make decisions on regulation of public life. 
“This virus is in our country, and it will remain in our country,” Dr. Wieler said. And the situation, he said, “can change at any time.”

The U.N. warns of the pandemic’s ‘potentially catastrophic’ impact on the world’s children.
While children have been largely spared the worst of the Covid-19 illness, the United Nations has warned that the social and economic fallout of the pandemic “risk being catastrophic and amongst the most lasting consequences” for the young. 
In a new report, researchers found that as schools remain closed, families lose income, food resources become harder to secure and the health needs of children go unmet, hundreds of thousands of children could die and millions could be plunged into poverty.
“I appeal to families everywhere, and leaders at all levels: protect our children,” the U.N. secretary general, António Guterres, said in a video statement announcing the report.
The report, released on Thursday, found that the pandemic was turning into “a broader child-rights crisis” that would play out unevenly around the world. 
“All children, of all ages, and in all countries, are affected,” it said. “However, some children are destined to bear the greatest costs.” The report cited “children in the poorest countries, and in the poorest neighborhoods, and for those in already disadvantaged or vulnerable situations.”
“Polio vaccination campaigns have been suspended. Measles immunization campaigns have stopped in at least 23 countries,” according to the report. “And as health services become overwhelmed, sick children are less able to access care.”
Infant mortality is likely to rise, the report said. School closures reduce many children’s nutrition and safety. Mr. Guterres said that 310 million schoolchildren, nearly half of the world’s total, rely on schools as a daily source of food.
In addition, with children at home and families under increasing stress, he said, “children are both victims and witnesses of domestic violence and abuse.”
U.S. roundup: Trump encourages protests against some state restrictions.
President Trump on Friday openly encouraged right-wing protests of social distancing restrictions in states with stay-at-home orders, a day after announcing guidelines for how the nation’s governors should carry out an orderly reopening of their communities on their own timetables.
In a series of all-caps tweets that started two minutes after a Fox News report on the protesters, the president declared, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” and “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” — two states whose Democratic governors have imposed strict social distancing restrictions. He also lashed out at Virginia, where the state’s Democratic governor and legislature have pushed for strict gun control measures, saying: “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!”
His stark departure from the more bipartisan tone of his announcement on Thursday night suggested Mr. Trump was ceding any semblance of national leadership on the pandemic, and choosing instead to divide the country by playing to his political base.
[Analysis: Oil collapse and covid-19 create toxic geopolitical stew.]Echoed across the internet and on cable television by conservative pundits and ultraright conspiracy theorists, his tweets were a remarkable example of a president egging on demonstrators and helping to stoke an angry fervor that in its anti-government rhetoric was eerily reminiscent of the birth of the Tea Party movement a decade ago.
Mr. Trump’s call for liberation from social distancing rules followed protests around the country as protesters — many wearing red “Make America Great Again” hats — congregated in packed groups around state capitols to demand that restrictions be immediately lifted and to demonize their Democratic governors.
The tweets contrasted with his message on Thursday, when he told governors  “you’re going to call your own shots,” and said that reopening would proceed “one careful step at a time.” 
After saying repeatedly that there was plenty of testing — a claim many governors, like health experts, have refuted — Mr. Trump tweeted, “the States have to step up their TESTING!”
Canada’s big annual party will go virtual, the government said.
This year’s celebration of Canada Day in Ottawa will — like so many occasions derailed by the coronavirus — take place as an online-only affair, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government announced on Friday.
Often referred to as the nation’s birthday, Canada Day, July 1, is one of the country’s major national holidays, and ordinarily draws crowds from across the country to Ottawa, the capital.
A concert stage is built in front of the Parliament buildings for performances by musicians, actors and comedians throughout the day and evening, and the program culminates in a fireworks show. Other events are held elsewhere in the city and across the Ottawa River in Gatineau, Quebec.
This year, the main stage was to be in a park because of construction work in front of the Parliament buildings. 
Steven Guilbeault, the minister of Canadian Heritage, said on Friday that the government will work with artists and performers to come up with a virtual approximation of the celebrations.
“Together, we are meeting one of the greatest challenges in our history, and this year more than ever, Canada Day will highlight the strength that unites us,” Mr. Guilbeault said.
Mr. Trudeau has repeatedly suggested that restrictions on public gatherings would remain in place for at least several more weeks and perhaps months.
Summer is a key time for celebrations and festivals in Canada where the season is relatively brief. Quebec, effectively canceled summer last week by announcing that all indoor and outdoor festivals, cultural events and most sports events would be canceled until the end of August.
Canada Day marks the date in 1867 when three British provinces were united as a largely independent Dominion of Canada, with its own Parliament.
Americans and Europeans tell of harassment in India, where foreigners are blamed for contagion.
Julie Price, an American living in India, was trying to buy food. But when she reached a grocery store in the city of Hyderabad late last month, a guard blocked her from entering. A bystander took her picture, said that foreigners were not allowed in and threatened to call the police.
A crowd had gathered, and she rushed home.“I was so scared that I did not leave my apartment for 20 days,” said Ms. Price, a Tennessee native who arrived in India in January for a long work trip. Her experience is not unusual.
In recent weeks, Americans and Europeans in India have been evicted from hotels and apartments, aggressively questioned on the streets and forced to ration food in remote beach towns amid what appears to be a rise in xenophobic incidents during the pandemic. Many of India’s initial cases emerged from foreign travelers, and some South Asians believe that Westerners carry the coronavirus.
After India declared a nationwide lockdown on March 24, shutting most shops and halting international flights, Ms. Price, who runs a branch of her graphic design business from Hyderabad, hunkered down in a rented apartment. 
“This is the first time I’ve ever been treated rudely here,” Ms. Price said. “It really upset me. I have to eat, too.”
This week, after her story spread in Hyderabad, the police showed up at her apartment and offered to escort her to the store. A manager there apologized and offered Ms. Price his personal number. 
Mahesh Muralidhar Bhagwat, a police commissioner in Hyderabad, said the incident was under investigation. He said Indians who blocked others from buying food on the basis of nationality or ethnicity would be met with an “iron fist.”
“The police do not tolerate this and legal action will be taken,” he said.The latest in science: Medical ingenuity is abounding where ventilators aren’t.  
As the coronavirus rages across the globe, ventilators that pump oxygen into the lungs of critically ill patients have been embraced as the best hope for saving lives.
In the United States, fears of ventilator shortages have unleashed a wave of experimentation  that is leading to some promising alternatives to help sustain patients. 
Some hospitals have been using CPAP and BiPAP machines, designed for people with sleep apnea, to keep coronavirus patients breathing without having to resort to intubations and ventilators. Engineers have transformed hooded hair salon dryers into personal negative pressure chambers that deliver oxygen and limit the spread of aerosolized virus, lowering the infection risks for health care workers and other patients.
Pulmonologists across the country have been turning to a remarkably simple intervention: flipping patients onto their stomachs, which markedly improves oxygen levels for those in respiratory distress.
Doctors say these and other ad hoc interventions have allowed many hospitals to weather the surge of desperately ill patients in recent weeks, and may have helped stave off the dire ventilator shortages and rationing that some had feared.
“Some of these are battlefield interventions that we would not normally use in hospitals, but this crisis has been an incredible spur for creativity and collaboration,” said Dr. Greg Martin, a pulmonologist in Atlanta and the president-elect of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. “The beauty of this is that we’re learning a lot and hopefully some of this will translate to things we can use in the future.”
France weighs digital tracking against liberty in its fight against the virus.
As France sought clues last month on how to tame the coronavirus, experts looked at one tool that has been central to the strategy of some Asian nations: digital tracking. Citing threats to “individual liberties,” the powerful interior minister dismissed it as alien to “French culture.”
But three weeks later — and after a tenfold spike in deaths — French culture could be changing. President Emmanuel Macron, who this week extended a nationwide lockdown by at least another month, said his government was considering using a smartphone tracking app that would inform people if they have come in contact with an infected person.
Such steps are particularly fraught in Europe, the continent with the world’s toughest online privacy rules. But as the country struggles to find a way out of a lockdown that is entering its second month and has kept a population of 67 million confined to their homes and paralyzed its economy, options that once seemed unfathomable have steadily become more palatable.
Recent experience in Asia shows that comprehensive tracing of infection chains, along with aggressive testing, has proved critical to fighting the pandemic. And the situation is calling into question a host of Western assumptions, including about the use of digital tracking and the wearing of face masks.
Those in France who argue in favor of allowing the app’s intrusiveness say that it is fair to infringe on people who are infected rather than inhibit the freedom of society as a whole. But there are concerns that the app, relying mainly on a sense of civic duty, will be so watered down in France that it will prove ineffective.
A judge rules that Mexico must extend its coronavirus measures to migrants.The Mexican government was ordered to extend its coronavirus protections to migrants in a ruling made public on Friday.
The ruling said health care should be guaranteed to people who were detained and that temporary residency status be given to people determined to be particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Reuters reported.
The order also said the government would have to identify symptomatic detainees, report the number of migrants who were detained and release members of vulnerable populations. Migrants are also to have accessible information on ways to protect themselves. 
Mexico, which has more than 6,200 cases and nearly 500 deaths from the virus, first declared a health emergency on March 30 — after initial resistance. The ruling came after advocacy groups claimed the government had not been adequately protecting migrants and asylum seekers. Mexico had more than double the number of asylum requests last year than it did in 2018.
With businesses closed to slow the spread of the virus in the country, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that next month $2.5 billion would be distributed to support the economy. Mr. López Obrador did not specify how the money would be sent, but said that there would be three million loans to small businesses. 
Beijing finds that messages that work at home can backfire abroad.
China’s top leader, Xi Jinping, has used the coronavirus pandemic to shore up his political power at home, but the tools the Communist Party has exploited to do this are threatening China’s international standing.
Internationally, China has demanded praise of Mr. Xi from countries receiving its experts and supplies, and has vented at the world a vitriol usually reserved for domestic audiences, provoking anger.
China’s embassy in France posted a statement on its website accusing Western governments of failing to protect their most vulnerable, letting nursing home residents die abandoned. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman floated a conspiracy theory that Americans might have introduced the virus to China.
In the past week, officials in France, Britain and nearly two dozen African nations have rebuked Chinese government actions. China has been accused of hypocrisy, hubris and obfuscating the virus’s origins.
Japan has pledged to help companies move production out of China because of concerns about the country’s reliability. And President Emmanuel Macron of France questioned whether China’s heavy-handed methods were a model for democracies to follow.
China’s state media portray Mr. Xi as a forceful yet benevolent leader, and in calls with world leaders, he emphasizes global unity and China’s willingness to help. In Beijing’s official accounts of those calls, other leaders praise him effusively.
While lashing out at anti-Chinese sentiment around the world, China has turned a blind eye  to —  and even, critics say, encouraged — xenophobia at home. China has restricted entry from abroad, allowing it to portray the danger as a foreign one, even though many of those returning from other countries were Chinese citizens.
The European Union’s top foreign policy official, Josep Borrell, recently accused China of stoking a “battle of the narratives” and stigmatizing Europeans. After member nations complained about substandard medical supplies bought from China, the bloc made a point of thanking Taiwan for its donation of masks, a gesture that would previously have been considered too risky for fear of offending Beijing.
A general defies a government order, creating tensions in Sudan.
A dispute over measures to counter the coronavirus in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, has led to an open confrontation between the country’s military and political leaders, underscoring the fragility of the country’s transition to democracy.
The civilian prime minister, Abdalla Hamdok, announced on Thursday that he had fired the governor of Khartoum, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Abdoun Hamad, for defying a government order to cancel Friday prayers in Khartoum and its sister city across the Nile, Omdurman.
Like many African countries, Sudan has a relatively low incidence of coronavirus — 32 confirmed cases and five deaths from Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus — but officials fear that a larger outbreak would quickly overwhelm the country’s dilapidated health system.
But General Hamad refused the prime minister’s order, saying in a statement issued by his office hours later that he intended to remain in his position — an unusually public act of defiance that exposed a growing rift inside the ruling Supreme Council, which is composed of civilians and army generals and is supposed to lead the country toward democratic elections in 2022.
The coronavirus crisis has exacerbated those tensions. After a jump in confirmed cases this week, the government canceled Friday prayers and announced a three-week lockdown set to take effect on Saturday.
In defiance of those orders, a group of protesters massed outside the army headquarters on Thursday to call for the ouster of Mr. Hamdok’s government. “No to the government of hunger,” read one sign.
Hours later, as the confrontation with the Khartoum governor, General Hamad, unfolded, senior Sudanese civilian officials contacted Western officials and local journalists to warn that they feared the military would use the coronavirus lockdown to seize power while the outside world was distracted by the public health crisis. Several Western officials, though, said there was little sign of an imminent power grab. 
European car sales plummeted in March.
New data on Friday gave the first concrete indication of how severely European carmakers were hit by coronavirus lockdowns, and it was every bit as bad as feared.
New car registrations in the European Union fell 55 percent last month compared with a year earlier, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said, as dealers closed their doors and buyers were stuck in their homes. Owners registered 570,000 new cars during the month, down from 1.3 million in March 2019.
Sales all but evaporated in Italy, the European country that went into lockdown the earliest, falling 85 percent. Spain and France also suffered declines of around 70 percent.
Carmakers that depend on southern Europe for sales also suffered the most. Fiat Chrysler sales plummeted 77 percent. PSA, whose brands include Peugeot, Citroën and Opel, suffered a 68 percent plunge in sales.
German carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen fared marginally better, with declines of less than 50 percent.
More than 1,000 French sailors from the Charles de Gaulle carrier group have tested positive. So far. 
Nearly half of the roughly 2,300 sailors from France’s Charles de Gaulle aircraft carrier group have tested positive for the coronavirus, the French defense minister said on Friday, amid growing questions over the military’s handling of the outbreak.
“It’s an issue that keeps me up at night,” the minister, Florence Parly, told a video hearing of  the defense committee of France’s lower house of Parliament.
The Charles de Gaulle, France’s flagship nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, returned to its Mediterranean home port of Toulon on Sunday, after the outbreak emerged. There were 1,760 sailors aboard the carrier itself, Ms. Parly said, and several hundred more on support vessels, including a frigate and a refueling ship.
Almost all the sailors have been tested, Ms. Parly, with 1,081 testing positive and results pending for another 929. Nearly 550 sailors are symptomatic, she said, and 24 are hospitalized in Toulon, one in intensive care.
The carrier’s outbreak recalls the one on the U.S. aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt, which became a debacle for the U.S. Navy. 
“We hear the doubts, we hear the questions, there are many on the origin of the contamination,” Ms. Parly acknowledged at the hearing. She said that medical and military investigations were seeking to determine how the outbreak started and whether it was adequately handled, and that the conclusions would be made public.
One hypothesis, Ms. Parly said, is that the outbreak was tied to a mid-March stop in Brest, on France’s Atlantic coast. Traditional family visits to the ship were canceled, she said, but sailors were allowed to disembark.
Ms. Parly forcefully denied media reports earlier this week suggesting that the defense ministry had denied a request by the carrier’s commander to end the mission on the stopover in Brest, which lasted from March 13 to 16, just before France went on lockdown to stop the spread of the virus.  
In Denmark, pupils go back to school in ‘a new world.’
On Wednesday, 350 pupils returned to classes at the Logumkloster District School for the first time in a month, as Denmark became the first country in the Western world to reopen its elementary schools since the start of the coronavirus pandemic. The move has turned the Danish education system into a laboratory for whether and how schools can function in an age of contagion.
“It is a new world,” said Tanja Linnet, the school’s head teacher, as pupils arrived on Thursday morning. “We used to make plans for if there was a terrorist attack here, but never this kind of attack.”
To stop the spread of infection, parents were not allowed inside. Teachers were not allowed to gather in the staff room. The children each had their own desks, two yards away from their nearest neighbor. During recess, they could play only in small groups. And by the time the school shut at 2 p.m., they had all washed their hands at least once an hour.
“We usually jump and hug and fight and give each other high fives,” said Zakarias Al-Tibi, 10, pointing at his best friend, Jannik. “But we can’t do that anymore.”
The World Health Organization has cautioned against reopening societies too quickly for fear of reviving the pandemic before it can be stamped out. The number of active cases in Denmark has dipped in recent days; it has recorded more than 7,000 infections and 336 deaths.
Many parents are conflicted. Some created Facebook groups protesting the reopening of schools, fearing that their children were being sacrificed to save the Danish economy. But by and large, parents at Logumkloster have been won over by how the head teacher and her staff refitted the school for safety.
China revises its figures in Wuhan, adding 50 percent more deaths. 
Faced with mounting skepticism over its official figures, China on Friday revised upward its death toll in the city where the coronavirus first emerged. 
Officials placed the new tally at 3,869 deaths from the coronavirus in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, an increase of 1,290, or 50 percent, from the previous figure. The number of confirmed infections in the city was also revised upward to 50,333, an increase of 325.
Officials in Wuhan said the revised death toll included those who died at home in the early days of the outbreak, as well as deaths that had not been properly reported by hospitals or registered on death certificates.
The move appeared to be a response to growing questions about the accuracy of China’s official numbers and calls to hold the country responsible for what has become a global health crisis. Dominic Raab, Britain’s foreign secretary, told Reuters on Thursday that China would have to answer “hard questions” after the crisis about how the pandemic came about and how it could have been stopped earlier. President Emmanuel Macron of France told The Financial Times that “there are clearly things that have happened that we don’t know about.”
The C.I.A. has also told the White House that China’s official figures are vastly understated, though it does not know the exact numbers, current and former American intelligence officials say.
Widespread reporting has shown that the Chinese authorities initially mismanaged and concealed the extent of the epidemic before eventually swinging into action in late January to halt the spread of the virus. Beijing maintains that it has been transparent in its communications about the epidemic from the beginning.
Epidemiologists still don’t know the worldwide death rate for Covid-19.
Coroners in some areas are overwhelmed. Funeral homes in virus hot spots can barely keep up. Newspaper obituary pages in hard-hit areas go on and on. Covid-19 is on track to kill far more people this year in some countries, including the United States, than the seasonal flu.
But determining just how deadly the new virus will be is a key question facing epidemiologists.As the virus spread across the world in late February and March, the projection circulated by infectious disease experts of how many infected people would die seemed dire: around 1 percent, or 10 times the rate of a typical flu.
But according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the death rate by dividing total deaths by the number of known cases, about 6.4 percent of people infected with the virus have now died worldwide.
The rates vary widely by geography. In Italy, the death rate stands at about 13 percent, and in the United States, around 4.3 percent, according to the latest figures on known cases and deaths, while in South Korea, where widespread testing helped contain the outbreak, 2 percent of people who tested positive for the virus have died.
But all of those percentages have a basic flaw: No one really knows how many people have the virus. Counting deaths has been far from perfect, but it is easier than counting infections, and some countries are doing far more testing than others.
In other words, it is not clear what the apparently varying death rates around the world really mean.
Virology experts say there is no evidence that any strain of the virus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, has mutated to become more severe in some parts of the world than others.
Ireland to increase its W.H.O. funding after Trump’s plan to halt aid. 
In response to President Trump’s decision to halt funding to the World Health Organization, Ireland said on Thursday that it would quadruple its annual contribution to the public health agency.
Simon Coveney, the country’s foreign minister, said that Ireland “strongly supports” the organization’s effort to lead the global response to the coronavirus and would contribute 9.5 million euros, about $10.2 million, this year toward that mission.
“So many countries rely on United Nations expertise and capacity to save lives,” he wrote on Twitter.
Mr. Trump said on Wednesday that the United States would freeze funding to the health organization while his administration reviewed its handling of the crisis, accusing it of promoting disinformation about the scale of the disease’s threat. 
Critics say the Trump administration was slow to take the pandemic seriously and lagged on facilitating wide-scale testing to help fight the outbreak.
The United States is the largest funder to the W.H.O., and last year contributed about $553 million of the agency’s $6 billion budget.
The decision to suspend funding provoked criticism from other countries, with officials warning that pulling support from an already underfunded agency could have severe consequences. And nations declared their continued support.
Britain also said it would continue to fund the organization, which it says has an important role in the response to the outbreak. “It is a global challenge, and it’s essential that countries work together to tackle this shared threat,” a Downing Street spokesman said on Wednesday.
In Spain, calls to ‘free’ the children intensify under a strict lockdown.
Most children in Spain haven’t been outside in five weeks. Unlike in France, Britain and even Italy, children are forbidden to even take a short walk on the street or exercise near their homes.
Such confinement measures, the most stringent in Europe, have left parents, health experts and politicians alarmed over the potentially harmful consequences that the confinement will have on children’s physical and mental health.
“If adults can go for a walk with a dog, and now some nonessential economic activities are resuming, why do our boys and girls have to keep waiting?” Barcelona’s mayor, Ada Colau, wrote on Facebook, urging the authorities to “free our children.”
Calls to ease the lockdown for children have intensified in recent days, and the Madrid region may allow children under 14 to go out for an hour once a day by the end of the month.
Confinement can lead to eating and sleeping disorders, depression and aggressive conduct, among other troubles, child experts say, all of which can have a critical impact on a young person’s development. The ban on going outside has been worse for children who live in cramped apartments without a balcony or outdoor space.
Parents have reported that their children have lost interest in activities, cried a lot or become apathetic, and some in Spain who have tried to take their children out for a short walk said the young ones have refused.
“I think I’m just afraid of the street now,” Lia Cenador, 9, said of her refusal to go out after her mother offered her a chance to breathe some fresh air in Barcelona. “I’ve forgotten what it’s like to be on the streets.”
Singapore records another daily high, linked to crowded migrant dorms. 
Singapore announced a record jump in coronavirus cases for the second day in a row on Thursday, with most of the 728 new infections coming from crowded dormitories for migrant laborers.
The rise was a stark demonstration of the risks faced by low-wage migrants who have built the modern city-state, bringing focus to their poor living conditions. More than 1,050 cases were linked to the residences on Wednesday and Thursday, leading the government to promise changes in how the migrants, many from India and Bangladesh, are treated.  
While Singapore has been praised for its rigorous contact-tracing program, which quickly identified clusters of local transmissions, the coronavirus spread rapidly through dormitories for foreign laborers, where up to 20 people are crammed in each room with shared kitchens and bathrooms.
The health ministry said on Thursday that the surge in newly identified cases was in line with its “continued efforts to actively test and isolate the infected workers.”
After weeks of low transmission numbers, Singapore began recording a rapid rise in cases in March, as travelers from Europe and the United States brought the virus with them. By Thursday, the health ministry said it had not registered any imported cases for a week.
Israel begins mapping out a ‘controlled’ reopening.
Israel is readying a “pilot program” to ease back into normal life, beginning with the “controlled and measured” reopening of businesses in certain sectors, but officials still need to hash out details, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.
With more than a million Israelis idle — the unemployment rate is 26 percent — Mr. Netanyahu said the finance ministry was mapping out a plan to allow select businesses to resume operations and would bring it to his cabinet for approval on Saturday night.
Some special-education students will also be able to restart private lessons, and people will be permitted to exercise within a 500-meter radius of their homes. Until now, Israelis had been constrained to 100 meters from their front doors.
The announcement came hours after about 1,000 people protested on Thursday night in Tel Aviv against Mr. Netanyahu, the indicted head of a caretaker right-wing government. The demonstration prompted Mr. Netanyahu’s son Yair to write on Twitter that he hoped that “the elderly people who die following this protest” were left-wingers. He later deleted the post.
Separately, Muslim officials said that Al-Aqsa mosque would remain closed throughout Ramadan, the monthlong holiday that begins on April 23.
China’s economy shrinks for the first time since 1976.
The coronavirus outbreak has brought China’s extraordinary, nearly half-century-long run of growth to an end — a stark reminder of the enormous task ahead for world leaders trying to restart the global economy.
China’s National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday that the country’s economic output shrank 6.8 percent from January through March compared with the same period last year. It is the first economic shrinkage acknowledged in official statistics since 1976, when the country was in the final days of the Cultural Revolution, a national spasm of urban violence and torture.
The numbers reflect China’s dramatic efforts to stamp out the coronavirus, which included shutting down most factories and offices in January and February as the outbreak sickened tens of thousands of people.
China is now trying to restart its vast, $14 trillion economy, an effort that could give the rest of the world a much-needed shot in the arm. But the spread of the virus to Europe and the United States has sharply cut the world’s appetite for China’s goods. That could lead to factory shutdowns and worker furloughs.
China’s National Bureau of Statistics confirmed last month that domestic industrial production, retail sales and investment all suffered record double-digit drops in the first two months of this year compared with the same period of 2019.
“This year is difficult — some have lost their jobs, some cannot find work to do,” said Liu Xia, a fruit vendor from a village on the outskirts of Beijing. “Those who do go to work and those who are still in business are greatly affected.”
Beijing’s options for dealing with the crisis are limited. Its economy has become too big and complex to easily restart as it did in 2008 when it unveiled a plan to spend more than half a trillion dollars. And years of easy lending have left local governments and state-run companies mired in debt.
Nairobi’s governor falsely touts Cognac as a coronavirus cure.
The latest fake cure for the coronavirus making the rounds: drinking Cognac. This week, Mike Mbuvi Sonko, the governor of Kenya’s capital, Nairobi, included small bottles of the alcoholic drink as part of care packages delivered to the city’s poor.
Mr. Sonko, who is known for his flamboyant lifestyle and was arrested last year over a multimillion-dollar corruption scandal, falsely argued that research by the World Health Organization had shown that alcohol played a “very major role” in killing the coronavirus.
Cognac, which he said would be distributed only to adults, “should act as a throat sanitizer. It kills the virus,” he said in a video while wearing sunglasses, a mask, a cap and a shield.
The local operation of Hennessy, the French Cognac distiller, rebutted Mr. Sonko’s claim in a statement, saying that its alcoholic beverages do not protect against the virus. The company urged people to wash their hands, practice social distancing and stay at home.
As with other regions, myths and fake news about the virus and how to fight it have been circulating across Africa, with many shared widely through social media and applications like WhatsApp. The purported treatments have included drinking black tea with no sugar in Kenya, shaving beards in Nigeria and boiling and drinking aidan fruits in Ghana. The authorities in Burundi have cited divine intervention to explain the delayed arrival of the virus in the continent. In Tanzania, President John Magufuli has declined to close churches during the pandemic, saying that the coronavirus “cannot survive in the body of Christ; it will burn.”
As of Thursday, there were 17,247 cases and 910 deaths from the coronavirus across Africa, according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

LONDON — When Boris Johnson was campaigning for Britain to leave the European Union in 2016 — a path that many experts warned would end in disaster for the country — one of his close allies, Michael Gove, famously declared that “people in this country have had enough of experts.”
Now, Mr. Gove and Mr. Johnson are leading the British government as it confronts the calamity of the coronavirus, and Mr. Johnson, now the prime minister, insists the process is being guided by experts. The trouble is, those experts can often disagree with each other or change their minds about the right course of action.
That messy back-and-forth has been on vivid display this week with the publication of a startling new report on the virus from a team at Imperial College in London. The report, which warned that an uncontrolled spread of the disease could cause as many as 510,000 deaths in Britain, triggered a sudden shift in the government’s comparatively relaxed response to the virus.
American officials said the report, which projected up to 2.2 million deaths in the United States from such a spread, also influenced the White House to strengthen its measures to isolate members of the public.
Imperial College has advised the government on its response to previous epidemics, including SARS, avian flu and swine flu. With ties to the World Health Organization and a team of 50 scientists, led by a prominent epidemiologist, Neil Ferguson, Imperial is treated as a sort of gold standard, its mathematical models feeding directly into government policies.
But outside experts pointed out that the report’s alarming conclusions — that the virus would overwhelm hospitals and that governments had no choice but to impose radical lockdown policies — had been made in previous reports on coronavirus or on social media sites devoted to the outbreak.
“A lot of it is not what they say, but who says it,” said Devi Sridhar, director of the global health governance program at Edinburgh University. “Neil Ferguson has a huge amount of influence.”
Imperial College, experts noted, was part of the advisory group for the government’s now-abandoned strategy, which played down radical social distancing and accepted that the infection would spread through the population. The theory is that this would build up so-called “herd immunity,” so that the public would be more resistant in the face of a second wave of infections next winter.
But such a strategy, the report noted, would lead to a flood of critically ill patients in a country without enough beds. Instead, it said, Britain needs to pursue “suppression,” which involves far stricter lockdowns, like the closing of schools and the quarantine of infected people and their families. That would drive down the number of cases and spread out the flow of patients over a longer period, allowing hospitals to cope.
Dr. Ferguson has been candid that the report reached new conclusions because of the latest data from Italy, which has seen a spiraling rate of infections, swamping hospitals and forcing doctors to make agonizing decisions about who to treat.
“The U.K. has struggled in the past few weeks in thinking about how to handle this outbreak long term,” Dr. Ferguson said in an interview on Monday, just after the report was released. “Based on our estimates and other teams’, there’s really no option but follow in China’s footsteps and suppress.”
The report added, “this conclusion has only been reached in the last few days, with the refinement of estimates of likely ICU demand due to COVID-19 based on experience in Italy and the UK.”
But other experts said the burden on hospitals was clear as far back as the original outbreak in Wuhan, China. Lancet, the British medical journal, published an article in January, based on studying a small group of patients, which found that a third of people had to be admitted to intensive care units.
“I can’t help but feel angry that it has taken almost two months for politicians and even ‘experts’ to understand the scale of the danger from SARS-CoV-2,” said Richard Horton, the editor-in-chief of Lancet, on Twitter. “Those dangers were clear from the very beginning.”
Some said governments should treat the report’s projections about suppression policies with the same caution. It says social distancing measures might have to be imposed for 18 months or more, at least intermittently, until a vaccine is developed and tested. But the report acknowledges this is uncertain, given the possibility of drug treatments and the mystery of how the virus is transmitted.
“We’re all using the 1918 pandemic flu handbook,” Dr. Sridhar said. “But we’re in a different position than in 1918. We’re in 2020.”
After days of confusion about the wisdom of encouraging “herd immunity,” the government sought to play down the dispute, arguing that this was not a deliberate part of its strategy but a byproduct of it. But it shifted to a policy of urging people not to go to pubs, restaurants, theaters or museums.
On Tuesday, the government’s chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said he expected these new, more stringent restrictions to last for months — and that the authorities would have to monitor very carefully what would happen when they are eventually lifted.
British officials recognize that their health service faces a moment of truth. All non-urgent operations in England will be postponed for at least three months, starting April 15, to free up 30,000 beds to help tackle the coronavirus.
Britain lags behind other European nations in its supply of ventilators. Plans are underway to ramp up their numbers from over 8,000 to 12,000, though officials are reluctant to promise that even this is sufficient.
Underscoring the change in tone, Britain’s finance chief, Rishi Sunak, announced a gargantuan fiscal stimulus to salvage reeling British businesses and to try to stem job losses. The package, worth £330 billion, or $422 billion, will include government-backed loans and tax breaks for companies and a three-month break in mortgage repayments for strapped homeowners.
“We have never in peacetime faced an economic fight like this,” said Mr. Sunak, who also promised support for airports and airlines in the coming days, after Britons were advised against all non-essential travel.
Mr. Johnson hinted on Tuesday that schools could be closed soon. But he still faces criticism for a lack of clarity, including his decision to urge people to avoid pubs and restaurants but not to order their closing. In fact, the government now intends to relax laws to allow pubs to stay open and produce takeout food.
To Mr. Johnson’s embarrassment, one of those promising to visit his local pub was his own father, Stanley Johnson.Sheri Fink contributed to this report from New York."

This briefing has ended. Follow our latest coverage of the coronavirus pandemic.Trump calls to “LIBERATE” states where people are protesting social distancing restrictions.President Trump on Friday openly encouraged right-wing protests of social distancing restrictions in states with stay-at-home orders, a day after announcing guidelines for how the nation’s governors should carry out an orderly reopening of their communities on their own timetables.
In a series of all-caps tweets that started two minutes after a Fox News report on the protesters, the president declared, “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” and “LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” — two states whose Democratic governors have imposed strict social distancing restrictions. He also lashed out at Virginia, where the state’s Democratic governor and legislature have pushed for strict gun control measures, saying: “LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!”
His stark departure from the more bipartisan tone of his announcement on Thursday night suggested Mr. Trump was ceding any semblance of national leadership on the pandemic, and choosing instead to divide the country by playing to his political base.
Echoed across the internet and on cable television by conservative pundits and ultraright conspiracy theorists, his tweets were a remarkable example of a president egging on demonstrators and helping to stoke an angry fervor that in its anti-government rhetoric was eerily reminiscent of the birth of the Tea Party movement a decade ago.
Mr. Trump’s call for liberation from social distancing rules followed protests around the country as protesters — many wearing red “Make America Great Again” hats — congregated in packed groups around state capitols to demand that restrictions be immediately lifted and to demonize their Democratic governors.
In Michigan, protesters waved banners in support of Mr. Trump and protested Gov. Gretchen Whitmer by chanting, “Lock her up.” In St. Paul, Minn., a group calling itself “Liberate Minnesota” rallied against stay-at-home orders in front of the home of Gov. Tim Walz. In Columbus, Ohio, protesters crowded closely together as they pressed up against the doors of the state’s Capitol.
Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington said Mr. Trump’s tweets “encourage illegal and dangerous acts” and said the president was “putting millions of people in danger of contracting Covid-19.”
Mr. Inslee added: “His unhinged rantings and calls for people to ‘liberate’ states could also lead to violence. We’ve seen it before.”
And in Michigan, Ms. Whitmer said she hoped the president’s comments would not incite more protests.
“The most important thing that anyone with a platform can do is try to use that platform to tell people, ‘We are going to get through this,’” she said.
The lack of testing presents a serious challenge to reopening, health experts say.
Any effort by states to begin to ease restrictions requires an expanded testing capacity to give people a sense of security, health experts say, and the country is far behind in conducting enough tests to responsibly inform those decisions.
But Vice President Mike Pence asserted on Friday that the United States currently has the testing capacity to allow all states to move to begin the first phase of the White House’s guidelines for reopening their economies.
“Our best scientists and health experts assess that today we have a sufficient amount of testing to meet the requirements of phase one reopening if state governors should choose to do that,” Mr. Pence said at the White House’s daily briefing. He was followed by several top public health officials, who provided a detailed description of the nation’s testing capacity, whose scale they said was underappreciated.
Speaking after Mr. Pence, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the federal government’s top infectious disease expert, said that “existing capacity” for testing nationwide can be utilized, but used the future tense when discussing the potential for states to scale back social distancing measures. “We will have, and there will be enough tests to take this country safely through phase one,” Dr. Fauci said.
The numbers the officials cited in the briefing — 3.7 million tests so far, and about 120,000 tests per day — represent the current snapshot of testing in the United States. But experts said that testing will have to be drastically expanded to get an accurate picture of how the virus is spreading around the country, and to be able to stamp out future outbreaks. The ultimate goal is to separate the sick from the healthy so that Americans feel safe returning to a somewhat normal life and the virus does not sweep through communities again, which requires more widespread testing.
The capacity for such testing has been growing but not fast enough, public health experts say. Supplies continue to run out and some areas are still only testing people who present specific symptoms. Tests to determine whether someone has already had the virus are slowly rolling out, but most have not been vetted by the Food and Drug Administration.
State health officials and medical providers nationwide say they still cannot diagnose as many people as they need. The biggest challenge is gettingthe supplies needed to process tests, including chemical reagents, swabs and pipettes. Manufacturers of those supplies are facing a huge global demand.
Without widespread testing and surveillance, said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University in New York, “we won’t be able to quickly identify and isolate cases in which the patients are presymptomatic or asymptomatic, and thus community transmission could be re-established.”
Mr. Trump, whose administration has been criticized for its slow rollout of tests as the virus took hold in the United States, again sought to portray testing as a state responsibility on Friday, even as many governors are pleading for more federal help.
At his briefing at the White House on Friday evening, Mr. Trump dismissed the concerns that public health experts have raised about testing, claiming that “the United States has the most robust, advanced and accurate testing system anywhere in the world.” He rejected criticisms of its shortcomings as “false and misleading” and reiterated his position that “the governors are responsible for testing.” 
Earlier Friday, a telephone call between Mr. Pence and Senate Democrats grew heated as Democrats pressed the vice president about the lack of testing. Senator Angus King, the independent senator from Maine, called the lack of national testing a “dereliction of duty.”
In recent weeks, the F.D.A. has approved new tests that could make doing testing easier, such as one that measures the level of virus in saliva and does not need a swab. The F.D.A. also recently said a new kind of swab could be used to test for the virus, a polyester type that can be quickly manufactured in the millions. Both the saliva test and the polyester swab were cited by officials during the briefing.
Cuomo and Trump spar over the federal response to the outbreak.
In another series of tweets on Friday, the president rekindled a fight with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, only days after heaping praise on him, by saying that the state’s chief executive should “spend more time ‘doing’ and less time ‘complaining.’”
The retort came after Mr. Cuomo said that New York could not fully reopen its economy without more widespread testing and help from the federal government. Even before Mr. Cuomo had finished speaking during his televised daily briefing, Mr. Trump lashed out, tweeting, “We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn’t need or use, gave large numbers of Ventilators that you should have had, and helped you with testing that you should be doing.” He said Mr. Cuomo owed the federal government a thank-you.
“First of all, if he’s sitting home watching TV, maybe he should get up and go to work, right?” Mr. Cuomo responded in real time. “Second, let’s keep emotion and politics out of this, and personal ego if we can. Because this is about the people.”
Mr. Cuomo said another 630 people died of the virus in New York on Thursday, according to official state figures, bringing the total confirmed death toll to 12,822. He said the toll was “breathtaking in its pain and grief and tragedy.”
Prominent conservatives and donors are behind some statehouse protests. 
The protests in Michigan, Ohio and elsewhere calling for easing the restrictions were reminiscent of the early days of the Tea Party movement, when angry activists stormed town hall meetings of Democratic members of Congress to protest President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. Both featured impassioned demonstrators on the ground — and the behind-the-scenes involvement of prominent conservatives and donors.
The chairman of one of the groups behind Michigan’s protest on Thursday, the Michigan Freedom Fund, is Greg McNeilly, a close longtime associate of the education secretary, Betsy DeVos. Mr. McNeilly has denied any involvement by Ms. DeVos or others in her family, which has long financed conservative causes in Michigan.
Others organizing protests have been open about the involvement of outside donors.Speaking on a YouTube program called “Freedom on Tap,” the Trump-allied economics commentator Stephen Moore said he was “working with a group in Wisconsin that wants to do a drive-in,” which he equated to the sit-ins of the civil rights era, only this time in protest of the restrictions put in place by Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat.
Speaking of the planned Wisconsin rally, he said he had one big donor who had promised to pay the bail and legal fees of anyone who was arrested.
“So this is a great time, gentlemen and ladies, for civil disobedience,” Mr. Moore said. “We need to be the Rosa Parks here, and protest against these government injustices.”
Mr. Moore serves on Mr. Trump’s coronavirus economic advisory group and has helped start another group urging a faster reopening of the economy, called Save Our Country.
Mr. Trump had briefly considered Mr. Moore last year for a seat on the Federal Reserve board, but Mr. Moore’s past comments about women, including that they should not earn more than men, drew criticism.
In an interview, Mr. Moore declined to name the donor he was referring to, but described him as “so upset about what’s happening with the abridgment of freedom.”
Likening the latest protests to the Tea Party, he said that to focus on donors is to miss true wellsprings of anger among everyday people. “These are people coming to us, but we’re not coming to them,” he said. “All we’re trying to do is just encourage people to participate.”
The federal government will direct $19 billion in aid to farmers.President Trump said on Friday he would channel $19 billion to American farmers and ranchers who have been hurt by the fallout from the coronavirus, payments that come on top of tens of billions of dollars of assistance given to farmers in the last year to offset the pain of the trade war with China.
Most of the aid — $16 billion — will be in the form of direct payments to farmers who have experienced losses from the outbreak, Mr. Trump said in a briefing. The government will also buy $3 billion worth of fresh produce, dairy and meat that will be distributed to people in need through food banks and other community and faith organizations, he added.
“These are great people, great Americans,” Mr. Trump said of farmers. “It is money well deserved. Not only were they targeted at one point by China, and that was over a period of time, and you saw that happening, and they never complained.”
The Trump administration has extended $28 billion to American farmers and ranchers over the past year to help offset the pain of the president’s trade war with China. Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products in an effort to reach a trade deal, prompting China to respond with tariffs on American soybeans, pork, dairy and other products that crippled sales to one of the world’s largest markets.
The spread of the coronavirus has further disrupted agricultural supply chains. Outbreaks have shuttered meat processing plants, while the closure of restaurants and food service, a major consumer of American food products, means some dairy farmers have been forced to dump their milk. 
“Having to dump milk or plow under vegetables ready to market is not only financially distressing, but it’s heartbreaking as well to those who produce them,” Sonny Perdue, the secretary of agriculture, said in the briefing.
At least 7,000 people living in or connected to U.S. nursing homes have died.
The first warning of the devastation that the coronavirus could wreak inside American nursing homes came in late February, when residents of a facility in suburban Seattle perished, one by one, as families waited helplessly outside.
In the ensuing six weeks, large and shockingly lethal outbreaks have continued to ravage nursing homes across the nation. Now a tally by The New York Times has found the number of people living in or connected to nursing homes who have died of the coronavirus to be at least 7,000, far higher than previously known.
In New Jersey, 17 bodies piled up in a nursing home morgue, and more than a quarter of a Virginia home’s residents have died. At least 24 people at a facility in Maryland have died; more than 100 residents and workers have been infected at another in Kansas; and people have died in centers for military veterans in Florida, Nevada, New York, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon and Washington.
Over all, about a fifth of deaths from the virus in the United States have been tied to nursing homes or other long-term care facilities, The Times review of cases shows. And more than 36,000 residents and employees across the nation have contracted it.
Covid-19 is on track to kill far more people in the United States this year than the seasonal flu, but determining just how deadly the new virus will be is a key question facing epidemiologists, who expect resurgent waves of infection that could last into 2022.
The virus is known to be more deadly to aging, immune-compromised people, and small, confined settings like nursing homes, where workers frequently move from one room to the next, are particularly vulnerable to spreading infection. But oversights and failures also have contributed to the crisis.
In interviews with more than two dozen workers in long-term care facilities as well as family members of residents and health care experts, a portrait emerged of a system unequipped to handle the onslaught and disintegrating further amid the growing crisis.
Governors in Texas, Minnesota and other states are looking to ease restrictions.
Texas will let all stores in the state open next week for “retail-to-go,” permitting pickup and delivery but not in-store shopping. Minnesota will allow golf courses and driving ranges to reopen this weekend. Vermont will let its farmers’ markets reopen on May 1.
Around the country, governors began announcing plans to ease restrictions in their states on Friday, even as cases continue to surge in some parts of the country and inadequate testing will make it difficult for them to identify and contain future outbreaks.
In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said that he would lift restrictions on some medical procedures and reopen state parks while requiring masks and social distancing. Schools will remain closed for the remainder of the school year. 
In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine described what things might look like beginning May 1: new social distancing guidelines at businesses, employees wearing masks, and staggered arrival times and lunch times.
“Businesses won’t be able to attract workers or customers if they feel they aren’t safe there,” said Mr. DeWine, a Republican. “A lot of this will be common sense and taking what we’ve learned so far and putting it into effect.”
Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said on Friday that he would refer to the White House guidelines on reopening but not necessarily abide by everything they propose.
“We will obviously use that as a kind of baseline,” Mr. DeSantis, a Republican, said at a news conference in Fort Lauderdale. “It doesn’t mean Florida is going to do every single thing they say or not say.”
But just as much of the country entered life under quarantine in a patchwork fashion, it is poised to ease restrictions the same varied way, responding to the local needs to fight the virus.
In Maryland, where cases and deaths continue to rise, Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican, said at a news conference Friday that four things must be “solidly in place” before he moves to lift restrictions: expanded testing, increased hospital capacity for a surge in patients, more personal protective equipment, and a robust contact tracing operation. He said that he would give an update on the progress in those areas, and detail the state’s plans, next week. State officials said that schools there would remain closed through at least May 15.
Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced a bipartisan economic advisory committee on Friday that includes all four of the state’s living former governors and some of the nation’s leading corporate executives including the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook, and the chairman of Disney, Robert A. Iger, as well as the former head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen.
Dallas homeless shelter is evacuated after 38 positive tests.A Dallas homeless shelter was evacuated on Friday after 38 residents tested positive for the coronavirus, another example of the pandemic sweeping through one of the nation’s most vulnerable populations.
City officials said 164 residents at the privately run shelter, Dallas Life, were taken by bus to a hotel on Friday, and would be isolated in individual rooms for 14 days while the shelter was cleaned. Nobody was hospitalized, according to the shelter’s director, Bob Sweeney.
Mr. Sweeney said the shelter, which can house as many as 500 people, stopped taking new residents and reduced its staffing to a skeleton crew of about 12 in mid-March, as the pandemic escalated.
About eight days ago, he said, a resident with a fever tested positive for the virus. Two more residents tested positive this week, prompting health officials to order that everyone in the shelter be tested.
Advocates for homeless people said they were not surprised by the outbreak, given the risk that residents, many with respiratory illnesses, face when living in often cramped shelters. A week ago, 70 people at San Francisco’s largest homeless shelter tested positive for the coronavirus in the largest reported outbreak at a single shelter in the United States.
Doctors are prescribing hydroxychloroquine but don’t know if it works.
For weeks doctors around the country have been giving hydroxychloroquine to ill patients, and as a preventive measure to some who have been exposed to the coronavirus.
But even after treating hundreds of patients with the antimalarial drug, doctors interviewed did not report clear results or remarkable recoveries that can be traced to the drug.
At Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, most Covid-19 patients who are not on the verge of dying receive a five-day regimen of hydroxychloroquine, the long-used malaria drug that President Trump has repeatedly promoted as a “what have you got to lose” remedy. While his own top health officials are more cautious — noting there is limited evidence about the drug’s benefits — doctors across the country have been prescribing the drug for weeks.
Dr. Bushra Mina, the chief of pulmonary medicine at Lenox Hill, is well aware that there are no rigorous clinical trials showing that the drug works. But he can’t wait for the evidence to come in, he said, when people are dying.
“I think it’s a battle, and your options are very limited,” Dr. Mina said. “You’re really looking for what you can do with whatever evidence you have.”
Hydroxychloroquine and a related drug, chloroquine, have been used for decades to treat and prevent malaria, and hydroxychloroquine has been used by people with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis because it is known to calm the immune system. In laboratory tests, it has been shown to block the coronavirus from invading cells, although it hasn’t been proven in human trials. The drugs are not recommended for people who have abnormal heart rhythms.
Here’s a guide for those in need of financial help.If your income has fallen or been cut off completely, we’re here to help. Here is some basic information you’ll need to get through the current crisis, including guides to government benefits, free services and financial strategies.
Those we’ve lost: Israel Sauz, gas-station worker and new father, dies at 22.
Israel Sauz of Tulsa, Okla., couldn’t wait to see his first child, a baby boy named Josiah. And he couldn’t wait for the world to see him, too. So he got in close and took a picture for Facebook of his son, fast asleep in a green onesie, shortly after the boy came into the world one Sunday last month.
Just 21 days later, on April 5, Mr. Sauz was dead. He was 22.The cause was complications related to Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to family friends and the school district where he attended high school.
Many in Tulsa may not have recognized his name, but they knew the smiling face — he was an assistant night manager at a busy QuikTrip gas station and convenience store about a mile east of downtown Tulsa. He was still a teenager when he first started working for QuikTrip, a popular chain based in Tulsa.
He lived in the Tulsa suburb of Broken Arrow. He and his wife, Krystal, had celebrated their first wedding anniversary two weeks before Josiah was born.
Homemade or more professional: Which mask is best for you?
Face masks have become an emblem in the fight against the virus, with officials in the United States and elsewhere recommending — and in some cases mandating — that people wear them to help slow the spread of the deadly outbreak.
Figuring out what to wear is not so easy. N95 and medical masks, which offer the most protection and are heavily in demand, should be reserved for health care workers who are regularly exposed to infected patients.
Here’s a look at some of the types of masks you might encounter, how they work, what to consider when making your own and the level of protection they could provide.
A South Dakota mayor wrestles with the need for a stay-at-home order amid a local outbreak.Mayor Paul TenHaken of Sioux Falls, S.D., has abandoned his effort to put in place a stay-at-home order in his city, which is at the center of a coronavirus outbreak that shut down a Smithfield pork processing plant.
He told the City Council on Friday that new data showed that local hospitals were able to handle an influx of coronavirus patients, The Sioux Falls Argus Leader reported.
Earlier this week, Mr. TenHaken, a Republican, said in an interview that he was frustrated by his inability to convince Sioux Falls residents to stay in their homes. He had unsuccessfully petitioned Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, for a countywide stay-at-home order.
“We’re starting to become a poster child for a lack of response,” he said, noting that hundreds of people in his city had tested positive for the coronavirus, many of whom worked at Smithfield.
The people in his city were deeply divided over his efforts to institute a stay-at-home order. “I have half the city saying, ‘Shut this entire place down and tell me when to come out,’” he said. “And I have the other half saying, ‘Don’t you dare.’”
Tim Cook, Bob Iger, Janet Yellen and former governors join California’s bipartisan economic advisory council.Gov. Gavin Newsom of California announced a bipartisan economic advisory committee on Friday that includes all four of the state’s living former governors and some of the nation’s leading corporate executives including the chief executive of Apple, Tim Cook, and the chairman of Disney, Robert A. Iger, as well as the former head of the Federal Reserve, Janet Yellen.
The former governors are two Republicans, Pete Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, and two Democrats, Gray Davis and Jerry Brown. The committee will be led by Tom Steyer, the billionaire businessman and former presidential candidate.
Mr. Steyer said the committee’s aim would be “to develop a strategy to help California recover as fast as safely possible from the Covid-19 induced recession.”
“Health and safety remain the most important points here,” Mr. Steyer said.Mr. Newsom’s initiative to call on his predecessors is in contrast to President Trump who was asked in March whether he would consult with previous presidents for guidance on how to navigate the crisis. “I don’t think I’m going to learn much,” Mr. Trump said at the time.
Small Business Administration loans have so far flowed heavily to California and Texas.Money from the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of funds on Thursday, flowed heavily to California and Texas, with construction companies and manufacturers getting the largest number of loans, rather than harder-hit retailers and restaurants, according to new data.
The nearly $350 billion in the Paycheck Protection Program also disproportionately flowed to states that have suffered fewer infections and deaths under the virus, like Kansas, than to harder-hit states like New York and New Jersey, when adjusting for the size of the small-business economy in each state.
The new data, which include loan approvals through Thursday, show accommodation and food service firms have received less than 9 percent of the money from the program, about $30.5 billion, though they have suffered the largest job losses of any industry during this recession. Construction firms received the largest share, at just over 13 percent or about $45 billion worth.
The program was designed for banks to distribute the loans, which the federal government will pay off in most cases. That structure advantaged companies with existing relationships with banks.
S.B.A. officials included data on the largest lending institutions in the program, though they were not identified. The top lender distributed more than $14 million in loans with an average size of more than $500,000 per loan — suggesting that the institution was giving loans to relatively large businesses.
Meanwhile, stocks in the United States rallied on Friday, with efforts to reopen the economy taking center stage and investors undeterred by more data showing the economic damage.
The gains came after Mr. Trump told governors they could begin reopening, and Boeing — one of the nation’s largest manufacturers — said it planned to bring about 27,000 employees back to work in Washington State to resume aircraft production.
The announcement is the first attempt at large-scale resumption of business activity by a U.S. corporation since the much of the country most nonessential work. The S&P 500 rose 2.7 percent, while Boeing’s gains led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 3 percent jump.
After global stock markets nose-dived earlier this year, they have been rebounding since late March, as investors have routinely looked past evidence of the economic damage, and instead focused on hopes for an eventual recovery. Friday’s gains mean stocks ended the week higher, despite reports showing a historic plunge in retail sales and a continued surge in unemployment claim
Epidemiologists still don’t know the worldwide death rate for Covid-19.
Coroners in some parts of the United States are overwhelmed. Funeral homes in virus hot spots can barely keep up. Newspaper obituary pages in hard-hit areas go on and on. Covid-19 is on track to kill far more people in the United States this year than the seasonal flu.
But determining just how deadly the new virus will be is a key question facing epidemiologists, who expect resurgent waves of infection that could last into 2022.
As the virus spread across the world in late February and March, the projection circulated by infectious disease experts of how many infected people would die seemed plenty dire: around 1 percent, or 10 times the rate of a typical flu.
But according to various unofficial Covid-19 trackers that calculate the death rate by dividing total deaths by the number of known cases, about 6.4 percent of people infected with the virus have now died worldwide.
In Italy, the death rate stands at about 13 percent, and in the United States, around 4.3 percent, according to the latest figures on known cases and deaths. Even in South Korea, where widespread testing helped contain the outbreak, 2 percent of people who tested positive for the virus have died, recent data shows.
Those supposed death rates also appear to vary widely by geography: Germany’s fatality rate appears to be roughly one-tenth of Italy’s, and Los Angeles’s about half of New York’s. Among U.S. states, Michigan, at around 7 percent, is at the high end, while Wyoming, which reported its first two deaths this week, has one of the lowest death rates, at about 0.7 percent.
Virology experts say there is no evidence that any strain of the virus, officially known as SARS-CoV-2, has mutated to become more severe in some parts of the world than others, raising the question of why there appears to be so much variance from country to country.
With social distancing difficult on ships, the crew of the Mercy, a Navy hospital, moves ashore.
Aboard the hospital ship U.S.N.S. Mercy, docked in the Port of Los Angeles, most of the military crew is moving off the ship and into hotels ashore. Sailors will be bussed from their hotels to to work their shifts aboard the Mercy. Navy spokesman Lt. Andrew Bertucci said on Friday that the decision was made in order to better facilitate social distancing.
“The plan is to drastically decrease the amount of contact that the crew has with each other,” Lieutenant Bertucci said. “It will ultimately be safer for both the crew and the patients.”
Between 800 to 900 crew members had been living on the Mercy full-time, but that number will go down to about 100 to 200 in the coming days. On Thursday 150 sailors moved off the ship, and that same number is expected to move to hotels daily through Sunday. Lieutenant Bertucci noted that the crew aboard the U.S.N.S. Comfort, which is docked in New York City, recently moved most of its crew to hotels ashore as well.
The move comes after a total of seven crew members tested positive for Covid-19 since the ship arrived to help area hospitals treat non-Covid patients, and more than 100 of the crew who had been in contact with those seven have moved off the ship into precautionary quarantine. All of the Mercy sailors in quarantine have tested negative for the coronavirus and are regularly monitored in case they were to develop any symptoms.
The commanding officer of the Mercy’s medical treatment team, Capt. John Rotruck, is quarantined aboard the ship in his stateroom after an investigation found that he had been in proximity to a Covid-positive crew member. Captain Rotruck has tested negative for novel coronavirus, and said his ability to continue the ship’s mission is unchanged.
The ship will continue to treat the patients it already has onboard, and will take new patients as requested by local authorities.
There are 29 dead at one N.Y. nursing home. Or more. No one will say.Berna Lee got the call from the nursing home in Queens on April 3: Her mother had a fever, nothing serious. She was assured that there were no cases in the home. Then she started calling workers there.
“One said, ‘Girl, let me tell you, it’s crazy here,’” Ms. Lee said. “‘Six people died today.’”In a panic, Ms. Lee drove from her home in Rhode Island to the nursing home, beginning a two-week scramble for information, as workers at the facility, Sapphire Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing of Central Queens, told her privately that many residents had died, and that most of the home’s leadership was out sick or in quarantine.
Finally, she banged on her mother’s first-floor window to see if she was OK. It was unclear whether her mother understood what was happening, Ms. Lee said.
“I didn’t know how bad it was,” she said. “People told me bodies were dropping.”The crisis at Sapphire highlighted the desperate state of nursing homes in the New York region and illustrated what relatives of residents said was a deeply troubling lack of information about what was going on inside the homes.
China’s economy shrinks for first time in decades, and the death toll in Wuhan is revised higher.
Chinese officials on Friday said the world’s second-largest economy had shrunk in the first three months of the year, ending a streak of untrammeled growth that survived the Tiananmen Square crackdown, the SARS epidemic and even the global financial crisis.
The data reflects China’s drastic efforts to stamp out the coronavirus, which included shutting down most factories and offices in January and February as the outbreak sickened tens of thousands of people.
The stark numbers make clear how monumental the challenge of getting the global economy back on its feet will be, and may help to explain why world leaders — including President Trump — are so eager to restart their own economies. Since it emerged from abject poverty and isolation more than 40 years ago, China has become perhaps the world’s most important growth engine.
But the leaders in Beijing have faced criticism over a lack of transparency in their handling of the epidemic.
Faced with mounting skepticism over its official figures, China on Friday revised up its death toll in the central city where the coronavirus first emerged.
Officials in the city, Wuhan, placed the new tally at 3,869 deaths, an increase of 1,290, or 50 percent, from the previous figure. The number of confirmed infections in the city was also revised upward to 50,333, an increase of 325.
Officials in Wuhan said the revised death toll now included those who died at home in the early days of the outbreak, as well as deaths that were not properly reported by hospitals or registered on death certificates.

35,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2020/05/08/us/08reuters-health-coronavirus-copper-antimicrobial.html,The New York Times,2020-05-08,[],Copper Takes Aim at COVID-19 With Virus-Killer Coatings,,"
MELBOURNE — At an outer suburban manufacturing plant, engineer Byron Kennedy is resetting a machine to spray-print a layer of copper on to a door handle, aiming to use the metal's antiviral properties to counter the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic.
His firm Spee3D is better known as a producer of 3D printers for copper and aluminium, used by customers including the Australian defence force and U.S. Marines to rapidly print new parts to get broken equipment back in action without waiting days for spares to arrive.
""Up until the end of last year, our business was building the 3D printers, which were then used to build parts,"" Spee3D co-founder Kennedy told Reuters. 
""Come 2020, and the epidemic hits. We know about the antimicrobial properties of copper, so we thought 'Can we do something, can we help out here?'""
Copper's disinfectant powers have long been known and its antibacterial, antiviral and anti-fungal properties have been supported by scientific studies.
Spee3D commissioned Melbourne laboratory 360biolabs to look at how SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, reacts to copper surfaces. 
The results showed that 96% of the virus was killed off in two hours and 99.2% in 5 hours, compared to no change on stainless steel surfaces over the same period, Kennedy said. 
This is in line with a U.S.-government funded study https://bit.ly/2WdhxZR published in March that found SARS-CoV-2 remained viable for up to 4 hours on copper, compared with 2 to 3 days on plastic and stainless steel.
Spee3D then reset some of its machines to be able to coat surfaces such as door handles and push plates, and has already received orders from two Australian government departments to resurface door handles before staff return to work.
The Northern Territory's Trade, Business and Innovation Department said in a statement it was thrilled to adopt the technology to make its workplace safer.
The firm is also speaking with a big miner and several major door handle manufacturers about additional applications, Kennedy said.
SLOW TAKE-UPCopper had already been making some inroads into the healthcare sector after trials in hospitals, including in the U.S. state of Virginia https://www.ajicjournal.org/article/S0196-6553(16)30696-4/fulltext, in recent years. 
However, attempts by fabricators in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan to sell copper alloy products into the sector resulted in only a modest take-up, partly due to costs, said John Fennell, Chief Executive of the International Copper Association Australia.
""We are seeing outcrops of people adopting this, but not as much as you would have thought,"" he said.
COVID-19 looks set to give the metal a boost.In major copper producer Chile, the country's mines minister recently touted the use of copper in face masks, such as those produced by a U.S.-Chilean company, while U.S. miner Freeport McMoRan believes the pandemic will shine a light on how copper can help improve public health.
""Copper's use in health care equipment and facilities and in public places will undoubtedly grow significantly when the cost of copper, which has been a barrier in the past, is measured by the enormous cost to society that is being brought on by this pandemic,"" Freeport Chief Executive Richard Adkerson told a briefing last week.
New manufacturing techniques like 3D printing are also a potential game-changer as they can allow ultra-thin coatings to be applied quickly, while still taking advantage of copper's antimicrobial properties and cutting the amount of metal used, and therefore the cost.
The price of coating a standard office door handle is about A$50-A$100 ($33-$65), says Kennedy, although costs will fall over time.
Disappointing copper bulls, it's likely the new coating methods will keep a lid on the amount of metal used in healthcare, said analyst Lachlan Shaw of National Australia Bank in Melbourne.
""I think we can confidently say demand for copper for those uses will go up, quite possibly by a lot. Is that going to shift the dial for global demand? At this stage I doubt it,"" he said.

The Federal Correctional Complex in Oakdale, La., is the site of the first fatal coronavirus outbreak in the federal prison system. F.C.C. Oakdale — which houses some 2,000 inmates and employs close to 500 staff members in two low-security prisons (Federal Correctional Institution Oakdale I and F.C.I. Oakdale II) as well as a minimum-security camp — provides the economic lifeblood for a town of fewer than 8,000 people and the surrounding parish. Many of F.C.C. Oakdale’s inmates are serving sentences for nonviolent offenses, like drug sales and financial fraud.
The Bureau of Prisons maintains that it began preparing for the coronavirus outbreak in January. On March 26, Attorney General William P. Barr advised Bureau of Prisons officials that certain “at-risk inmates who are nonviolent and pose a minimal likelihood of recidivism” might be released to serve out their sentences in home confinement, under terms included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act.
On March 28, Patrick Jones, 49, who was serving a 27-year sentence at Oakdale for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, became the first federal inmate in the country to die from the virus. On April 3, Barr ordered federal prison officials to speed the release of “vulnerable inmates” from at least three federal institutions fighting major coronavirus outbreaks, including F.C.C. Oakdale. By the third week of April, seven Oakdale inmates had died. At least 100 inmates and staff members had been infected, with more than 20 hospitalized, as confusion, fear and anger gripped the interconnected community of inmates, officials, workers, family members and loved ones.Interviews have been condensed and edited for clarity. Several correctional officers requested anonymity for fear of retaliation.

Alice Jones, Patrick Jones’s mother: I talked to him in March — he always called me once a month — and I told him, “I love you, baby,” and he said, “I love you, Mama.” And that was the last time I talked to him. He was not sick. No sniffling, no coughing, nothing.
Correctional Officer 1: Me and another staff member took out an inmate to the hospital. We took him out on a Thursday [March 19]. We were told, “Oh, he has asthma.” It’s routine to take inmates that have health issues out on emergency medical trips. He said he was short of breath, couldn’t breathe. They gave him a mask. We weren’t offered any kind of protection.
Ronald Morris, correctional officer, president of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1007: I got a phone call saying we had an inmate go out with Covid-19 symptoms. And yeah, they told the staff he had asthma, and I think it was even on the paperwork that he had asthma, but then they sent him out with a mask. So, hell, yeah, it was very disturbing that they sent the inmate out with a mask and didn’t provide it to staff.
Correctional Officer 1: We checked him into the emergency room, and about an hour and a half later, they moved him from a regular E.R. room to a negative-pressure room, and that’s when they had us put masks on, but I’d already been around him without a mask on. No one told us he might have Covid-19. They said, “Hey, he got asthma issues.” Two days later, I got a call telling me he’d tested positive for the virus.
Alice Jones: They lied. He did not have a longtime chronic illness. No asthma. He did 100 push-ups a day.
Christopher Walker, Patrick Jones’s son: I didn’t know about it until my grandmother called me at like 1 o’clock in the morning. I don’t see how it just took him down like that.
Claudette Crumpton, Patrick Jones’s former girlfriend: He was as healthy as a bull. I always heard in prison the doctors don’t properly take care of them. If they fill out a piece of paper saying they sick, they wait a couple of days to get permission to see the doctor. And then they wait until they get damn near to their deathbed.
Ronald Morris: We found out that Jones tested positive for Covid-19 on the 21st. That’s when we locked down both institutions. And we had our second confirmed case that day also. He went to the hospital. On the 22nd, both C.O.s who took Jones to the hospital were cleared to return to work.
Correctional Officer 1: I got a call telling me I was on administrative leave. And then seven hours later, roughly, a supervisor calls and says, “Y’all are good to come back to work.” I was upset. I mean, you already know you’re exposed to it, but you know, got to pay the bills.
Gene Paul, the Republican mayor of Oakdale: I knew about that first inmate who went to the hospital and tested positive, and I knew that a corrections officer had transported him without a mask. But I didn’t know that his wife and daughter work here at City Hall. When I come to work Monday morning [March 23], his wife tells me that her husband was that correctional officer. I was like, “What?!” I sent them home and said not to come back for 14 days.

On March 28, nine days after being admitted to the hospital, Patrick Jones was pronounced dead. The federal Bureau of Prisons claimed Jones had “long-term, pre-existing medical conditions which the C.D.C. lists as risk factors for developing more severe Covid-19 disease.”
Don Cain, inmate at F.C.I. Oakdale I, via email: I will tell you how I heard the virus got in. I was told that a staff member from education bragged about going to New York City. The first death of an inmate was a guy who was in contact with that staff member. I heard that staff member was supposedly in critical condition in the hospital on a ventilator.
Wife of an F.C.C. Oakdale correctional officer, via Facebook Messenger: There’s also a rumor saying an inmate came off the bus as a new intake, and he brought it in.
Mayor Paul: As of last week [the week of March 30], they were still bringing inmates in from other facilities. It took them about a week to stop those buses. There was a lot of the ball being passed around with, “It’s not my responsibility, it’s the marshals’ responsibility, it’s not our responsibility, it’s somebody else’s.” Well, whose responsibility is it to stop this? I mean, I love the B.O.P. being here and everything, but you think you would have taken some precaution 10 or 14 days earlier to be halfway ready for this thing, especially when you got about 2,000 inmates and about 500 employees.
Correctional Officer 2: I know there was a conversation with the warden. It was myself and one of the case managers that I used to work with — who tested positive, by the way, he’s been out for a week, week and a half — he questioned the warden and said, “What do you think about this coronavirus, do you think we’re going to have a problem?” And he said: “Oh, no, because we live in the South, and it’s warm here. We won’t have any problems.” That was his exact words. Nobody gave us new direction on what we should be doing, how we should be preparing, what to look for, anything.
Ronald Morris: We tried to talk to the warden about safety protocols. I’d say as early as March 18 we talked to him about cross-contamination among the staff. We suggested we keep staff contained and not let them work between institutions. But the warden said he didn’t think that was needed at this time.

Oakdale prison officials including the warden, Rod Myers, did not respond to multiple detailed requests for comment.
Kirk Brannan, recently released from Oakdale prison camp: What happens is that the correction officers and administrators come and go between the facilities and between us and the civilian population. So if any one of them gets exposed, then they’re going to expose us.
Ronald Morris: I’d brought up in our daily meetings that the staff going on medical trips needed P.P.E. But it took them several days to issue N95s, so at first they wore surgical masks. Then the guys did have N95s, but we had not been properly trained to make sure we are doing this properly. And at times there have been shifts they would go work without being protected at all. On March 25, we had six inmates in the hospital for Covid. Each inmate requires two staff to watch him per eight-hour shift. On March 26, we had three confirmed staff with Covid-19.
Mayor Paul: We’re a close-knit community — everyone knows everyone, so there is a lot of concern and uncertainty. About 50 percent of the people in the surrounding area work at the prison, and the ones that live in Oakdale, they go to work, and then they go home and back into the community, go to stores, that kind of thing. When that first inmate tested positive, I called the warden, but he hadn’t returned my calls. Now I have people calling in asking me questions about what’s going on, and I couldn’t really tell them anything because I didn’t know anything. People just want to hear something. Just like, “Everything’s going to be OK,” or, “I spoke with the warden, and he said they’re working on this and everything’s going to be OK.” But I didn’t really have that information. So I called up my state representative, and he was getting calls about some of the same things, and the warden had never returned his call either. And then he called our U.S. congressman, Mike Johnson’s office, and Senator Bill Cassidy.
Ronald Morris: Our warden said he was writing the playbook. I cannot tell you how many times I heard the phrase that we were “writing the playbook” for the B.O.P. to handle this kind of thing when it reached other facilities. I mean, if we were writing the playbook, we were in a ditch.

Mandatory daily temperature checks of every inmate began on March 26. To house sick inmates, prison officials converted half a housing unit in Oakdale I to quarantine inmates who had been exposed to the coronavirus or were exhibiting symptoms.
Don Cain, via email: A guy they brought over to our pod had a cough. I had no symptoms whatsoever, and neither did the other four guys in my pod, but they told us to pack up, we were going to quarantine. I for sure thought I was next to die, as I have diabetes, and they say that having diabetes, it’s the one that is the hardest to fight the virus. I just knew they were going to stick me in there with someone who was sick, and I would contract it and would not be able to fight it and pass away. I was praying, asking God not to let them take me over there to that death unit.
Correctional Officer 3: We got three inmates getting tested to see if they had the virus, and we put them on a range, which is a straight hall that got cells. I fed those guys. I wore gloves. I didn’t wear masks. I didn’t think they had it. But turns out all three of them tested positive. And they went out to hospitals. It was just a wake-up call for me.
Correctional Officer 1: It took a little while to wrap your head around that it is a big deal. Then probably Thursday [March 26], I went to sit on one inmate at one of the local hospitals, and they gave us the little yellow paper gowns to put over our uniforms, and the N95 masks and gloves and goggles. But the nursing staff were coming in like they were about to take a spacewalk — the helmets, you know?
Ronald Morris: We had inmates at four local hospitals. At the hospital 40 miles away, they have a suit they wear with the helmet. Our staff don’t. I think half of a whole floor is negative pressure. At another hospital, we got patients in a regular I.C.U., and we sit outside a glass partition so we can observe the patient. They also have some inmates in regular rooms, and the staff are sitting in the room with them. Those are not negative pressure. At one hospital, staff had N95s, gloves and gowns. The health care workers have on the same thing. There are two negative-pressure rooms, and you sit in a vestibule and observe the inmate through the glass wall. The inmate is restrained to the bed, so if something happens to the inmate, we got to go in and remove restraints.

On March 27, five plaintiffs, including three employees at F.C.C. Oakdale, filed a class-action suit on behalf of all federal employees claiming that since Jan. 27, they had “performed work with or in close proximity to objects, surfaces and/or individuals infected with the novel coronavirus,” and asking for hazard pay.
Anita Kadrovich, correctional officer: For probably over a year and a half or so, my job was to take inmates to their medical appointments. I have rheumatoid arthritis; it’s an autoimmune disease. So I do low-dose chemo every week, which wipes out my ability to fight off anything. I have no immune system. My doctor told me I should not be around any of it. He sent me a letter. But I didn’t turn the letter in. I didn’t want to leave my people stranded — it’s like leaving a man behind.
Ronald Morris: Jones died on the 28th, and by then, we probably had up to about 12 inmates in the hospital, and another confirmed staff with Covid. On the 29th, we had seven confirmed staff. Then it just hit the accelerator, and it went fast. You had inmates going to the hospital by ambulance, two or three a day. I was pleading with the warden for help — we just didn’t have enough staff. And we were forcing staff to work 30 or 40 hours straight.
Kirk Brannan: At the camp, there’s two large dorms filled with bunk beds stacked end to end, three feet apart widthwise. So when you’re sleeping on your bunk bed, you’re within three feet of 12 people snoring and breathing hard. So there’s a lot of common breaths going on in there. It’s the epitome of an environment that can spread the virus if any one person gets it.
Ronald Morris: On March 30, we had 15 inmates in the hospital with Covid. We had seven positive staff and 16 staff out awaiting tests. On the 31st, we had 17 inmates in the hospital and eight staff positive, with a lot of people awaiting results. Then the second inmate died on April 1, and by then we was running. First we had 10 positive staff. At noon that day, we had 13 positive staff. By 5 o’clock that evening, we had 17 positive staff. It was very chaotic and stressful. Most of the guys that tested positive were either working in the housing units or sitting on Covid-19 patients in the hospital. In the housing units, they were only wearing surgical masks. They say if you work in an isolation unit, you must wear an N95, but where do you think these inmates are coming from? They’re coming from a housing unit where they won’t give you that mask. That’s our biggest bitch. How is it that you don’t wear the N95 mask where the symptoms originate from? If an inmate gets sick in this area and lives in that area, you don’t wear a mask, but if you put him in an isolation area, you wear a mask.

On March 31, the Bureau of Prisons ordered a 14-day lockdown across the federal prison system: “Inmates in every institution will be secured in their assigned cells/quarters to decrease the spread of the virus.” The lockdown permitted inmates in small groups to use the phones, computers, showers, commissary and laundry facilities.
Kirk Brannan: They have the camp inmates making sack meals, bag meals, for those who are on lockdown. They’re going on three and a half weeks of living on bologna sandwiches and peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches. That’s all they get to eat for dinner or lunch. They get a little packet of cereal for breakfast. Inmates at the camp are making those bags, and we don’t know if anybody infected is making those bags or not. They’re not testing. You would think if you have a potential of having an infection, you’d have to be tested before you get to handle people’s food. Well, that’s not being done.
Ronald Morris: We have, as of about an hour ago [on April 2], 20 staff who’ve tested positive for the virus. We probably got that many out at home waiting on test results. And that changes hourly. We have approximately 18 inmates in the hospital. We got approximately 40 or so inmates in isolation; these inmates are showing symptoms of Covid-19. We got over 80 inmates quarantined that have been exposed. Both of those numbers are growing daily. I am in the community hospital working, and I’m looking at the inmate through glass in the bed. He’s sleeping. I hope he doesn’t die on my shift.

On April 2, an inmate at the minimum-security prison camp who was exhibiting symptoms was tested for Covid-19. Anita Kadrovich had been transferred to work at the camp a few days earlier.
Anita Kadrovich: We thought we were fairly safe out here, but no. When the first inmate got sick, people started looking around and started getting worried. You could just tell on their faces. Everybody was like: Oh, my gosh, it’s here. I felt the same way. When they came out to quarantine the first inmate, they had their hats on, they had their N95s on, they had the surgical mask over their N95. They had the gowns on, they had their feet covered, everything.
Correctional Officer 2: That same day, I asked the acting health-services administrator for an N95 mask, and she told me I didn’t need one. At the same time, she and all three of the nurses that were with her had on full protective gear. But I was told the surgical mask that had been provided was good enough. And that wasn’t the first time that we here at the camp had been denied. We’d requested masks two other times and were told, “You don’t need it.” They never gave us a reason other than, “Well, until there’s a positive case,” and now they tell us they aren’t testing because they assume if someone has symptoms, they have it.
Anita Kadrovich: And right after the first inmate was taken to quarantine, they called for safety to come out and decontaminate the health-service department. The safety guy told me that when he walked into the health-service department without his mask on, they were like: “No, no, put your mask on! That inmate was all around and in here!” So I’m like: “It was that serious for y’all, what about all of us? He was in our offices cleaning our doorknobs. Do we need to be decontaminated?” But they didn’t tell us any of that.
Correctional Officer 2: That inmate was one of our orderlies, so he was walking around without a mask every hour cleaning every door handle in the entire camp. He’d exhibited symptoms the previous week. He’d had a fever. And we requested the protective equipment, but they wouldn’t give it to us because they said we didn’t need it. They had a little dust mask, like a painter’s mask, and a pair of gloves that they would give us, but it’s nothing.
Anita Kadrovich: I feel like we’re guinea pigs.Kirk Brannan: Everything they’ve done has been really kind of the opposite of what they should have done. I can’t tell you how many guys, when I was leaving, came up to me and said: “Please get our story out there.” Something’s got to happen before something catastrophic happens.
Ronald Morris: You got the director of the B.O.P. saying they’ve been preparing since January, and they have a national stockpile of supplies. Well, where the hell are those supplies? Why can’t we get some? They did send us some national-stockpile N95 masks. Want to know how many? Two hundred! Two hundred! They couldn’t afford to give us any more. They know that we’re just the first institution that’s going to be dealing with this, so they need to hold it to ration it out to other institutions because they know their national stockpile is insufficient to begin with.
Heidi Burakiewicz, lead attorney on the federal class-action lawsuit: What I am constantly hearing from workers at Oakdale is that they’re looking for guidance, and they’re getting no guidance or contradictory guidance, or it’s constantly changing. I’m outraged when I hear people tell me: “I rode in a van with a sick inmate, and I asked for a mask, and they said: No, I didn’t need it.” Or: “I sat in a room in the hospital with a sick inmate, and I didn’t even have a mask on.” Or: “It was only a surgical mask.” That makes me angry. That was preventable. Somebody in this agency needs to take responsibility and start protecting these people.
Ronald Morris, via text, April 3: Five inmate deaths. Eighteen inmates in hospital, 727 inmates quarantined in five housing units. Two staff in hospital.
Don Cain, via email: A guy from our unit passed away. I did speak with him on a daily basis, so that hit home to actually know someone who was alive just last week and he is no longer here.
Correctional Officer 3: Inmates get sick with the coronavirus, and they don’t want to say anything until it’s so bad that we got to rush them out on the ambulance so they don’t die. We had one guy, he was about to die, and his cellmate waves over the corrections officer, and he was like: “Hey, uh, this guy’s not doing so well.” And then they had to put him on oxygen and rush him out to the hospital. He just laid in his bed, and he didn’t want to go to another unit, and he didn’t want to go to the hospital. All the inmates are scared because they don’t know what’s going to happen if they get it.
Don Cain, via email: People are scared and worried. They ask questions and complain, but we are told half-truths, kept in the dark.
Ronald Morris: We’ve had staff working 24 to 32 and 40 hours of overtime. You don’t have nobody to come relieve you sitting at the hospital, and inmates is going out left and right. We’re 50 minutes from the institution, so you got at least an hour’s drive. I had an officer that got to work at 6 that morning and volunteered to work at the hospital to relieve a staff member so they could go home. Ended at midnight and never got relieved, drove back to the institution because he had another shift to pull there and fell asleep three times on the highway. We cannot abandon the hospital post that we’re on or abandon the security that we’re providing for that inmate because we’ll face disciplinary action. We all take an oath to protect the public, to protect the institution, to protect each other and government property. We have a no-strike clause in our union contract. We’re bound by an oath kind of like the military to protect and serve.
Correctional Officer 2: Originally, they gave us a form, and it asked if you’d been exposed, if you had any symptoms, if you had seasonal allergies, how long you had seasonal allergies. Now all they’re doing is checking our temperature. You pull up, they put a little forehead thermometer and check your temperature: “OK, you want a mask and gloves? Go on in.” No “How are you feeling? Do you have body aches, are you nauseated? Do you have a cough, a runny nose, any of that?” We’re not questioned at all.
Anita Kadrovich: At 99 degrees, they clear you to come in. So you could have symptoms, and you could have been undetected.
Ronald Morris: If they let everybody self-quarantine, there ain’t nobody to work in the prison, and the bureau is not going to do that. So they’re going to make the excuse of “We’re doing enhanced screening to catch it, come back to work.” That’s their answer. Is it the right answer? Hell, no, it’s not the right answer. But what is the right answer? You know, where do you get the help from? I had to pressure the warden to ask for temporary-duty staff to come and assist us. Our national union was telling us that they had people in the regional office ready to assist us, and I asked him if he knew about it, and he said no, and he said: “I don’t know if we need them.” And I said: ‘‘We need help! We can’t keep going at this pace. Will you ask for help?’' I had to ask him two or three times. They started showing up late March.
Mayor Paul: I spoke with the warden on Saturday [April 4], and I mean, this guy sounded like he was fixing to explode. You could hear it in his voice, I mean, exhaustion. I feel sorry for him. He just said it’s been such chaos out there for the last couple of weeks.
Correctional Officer 3: I’m not one of the people stuck working in the medical unit. If I was, I’d be worried every day. We’ve had staff members get sick because of having to work at the hospital for so long.

Since the outbreak began, a number of correctional officers who believe they were exposed to the virus say they have requested extra sick leave to self-quarantine but have been denied. Those who have taken time off anyway risk being designated “absent without leave” by their supervisors.
Correctional Officer 2: A memo is done saying a staff member was placed on AWOL because of “abuse of sick leave.” And that’s what they consider it. If you miss more than three days, you have to have a doctor’s note. And then when they place you on AWOL, the memo goes to the warden, and well, this warden, he refers every single case for disciplinary. The common thing is you get like three days without pay, if you abuse sick leave, and then it just climbs from there. I think one staff member spent 10 days without pay for abuse of sick leave.
Anita Kadrovich: A woman I know, she’s a single mom, and they mandatoried her to go work where all the quarantined inmates are. She broke down and cried because she just thought that was her death sentence. She has two girls, and she was like: “I just know I’m going to get it.” But she went. She sucked it up because that’s what we do. Can’t cry in prison. It’s harder for us women than it is as men, because we’ve got to show that we can do the same job they can do. And it’s mostly a man’s world inside the prison, so as women we have to suck it up and do everything just like the men do. And crying is not an option.
Jordan Cain, Don Cain’s daughter: We live in Wyoming, and, you know, we don’t know anything about Oakdale or anything like that. I know my dad, I feel like he’s scared. He hasn’t called me today [April 3]. So I’m a little worried already ’cause that was kind of one of his things, like, to make sure he calls us every day so we know he’s safe. He did have a heart attack last year. I mean, I am a little nervous right now.

Ronald Morris, via text, April 5: Twenty inmates placed among four local hospitals. Seven inmates in I.C.U. Four on ventilator. Twenty-one staff positive.
Kirk Brannan: The most important thing to me right now is to try to help some of these other guys get out. And I think the tools are in place to do that, if people who can exercise the tools will do so. I think the issue is the B.O.P. is a big bureaucracy. And like any typical bureaucracy, when something comes up that has to be done, it just takes some time to get it done. And because of that, they’re ignoring the severity of the emergency. The first guy left about five days before me; he had filed a petition for compassionate release a year ago. He’s 72 years old, has some health issues. I’m 66.
Don Cain, via email: Do you know anything about the CARES Act? I know I should qualify for what I hear are the standards.
Anita Kadrovich: They have let a few out on compassionate release. So a lot of the older inmates — the majority of our campers are older, and they all have medical issues — they are panicking. They’re doing anything they can to get their paperwork in to do compassionate releases, and case managers are getting overwhelmed with all the paperwork coming in for that. Families call and ask if we can pay for them to be furloughed or in a hotel room or let them come home, and I have to say it’s not my decision.

On April 6, the inmate at the prison camp who was tested for Covid-19 received a positive test result. The following day, a second camp inmate reported Covid-19-related symptoms and was placed in isolation.
Ronald Morris, via email, April 7: The camp is now on quarantine. The warden allowed cross-contamination to affect the camp staff and inmates.
Correctional Officer 2: Right now I’m looking at the front of the unit. And we have a piece of paper on the door where everybody goes in, and it says: “This unit is quarantined. Proper P.P.E. is required.” But all these inmates, they’re all in their dorms. They’re cleaning the floors, cleaning the bathrooms and the showers and pretty much doing their normal routines. I mean, they’re still in the dorm within arm’s length away from each other. On quarantine.
Don Cain, via email: We have no gloves. Only orderlies get gloves, and they wipe down phones and computers once a day, not after every use.
Anita Kadrovich: The community is scared to death of people who work out here. I don’t take it to heart when they turn around in the aisle at Walmart because I have my uniform on and kind of run the other way. I just grab a few things and be gone. I got pulled over for speeding, and the cop found out where I worked at. He backed away from my car and said: “Have a good day!” Southern people, we want to hug everybody. I am a hugger. But no, not now.
Correctional Officer 3: I mean, I completely understand where they’re coming from, but I have never had people like — they’re scared of us. They don’t want to get infected. I try not to go anywhere after work until I change clothes. I just get home, strip, dump everything in a wash and wash it a few times, because I don’t know what I came in contact with.
Wife of C.O.: It is very scary. We have to relive, every day, being scared that my husband has contracted this virus and that he might not be showing any symptoms. We are trying to be very cautious when he comes home. He literally strips down on our back patio, sprays his clothes, shoes, even work bag and hat down daily with Lysol before coming in the house through our sitting area in our bedroom to thoroughly shower. Then he tries to distance himself from us. But it’s so difficult trying to explain to a 2- and 3-year-old that they can’t hug or sit with Daddy.

Ronald Morris, via text, April 8: All of F.C.I. I is in quarantine. And now the prison camp is in quarantine. Forty-five positive inmates in both places. Fifty-three inmates in isolation. Three on ventilators. Six in I.C.U. Twenty-two staff positive. I lost count of staff awaiting results.
Wife of C.O.: My husband is trying to find an urgent care or doctor that will test him. He has a few symptoms but isn’t running a fever, therefore no one will test him. We’ve called several urgent cares and several doctor’s offices, no luck. The E.R. said they changed criteria today to qualify for testing. So we are hoping to be able to get him tested today. He has a cough, and he can’t smell. He said he’s feeling kind of off.
Anita Kadrovich: I should get my test results later today. I have a few symptoms, but it could be my rheumatoid arthritis, because I’ve been off my medicine because it drops my immune system. So to try to build my immune system up so I can continue to work without worrying about catching it. I just quit taking my medicine.
Don Cain, via email: There is still scared people and tension in the air, and you can feel the frustration of being kept inside without going outside except to get your meal. There is a lot of bickering at each other, sense of hostility toward each other like something is going to explode.

On April 8, a violent clash between inmates and correctional officers at Oakdale I occurred after the officers tried to reintegrate a group of prisoners from the isolation unit into the general population.
Ronald Morris: The administration screwed up. These inmates were over the Covid-19 virus, but they weren’t supposed to be released back out there yet, and so when they realized this, they went back an hour and a half later and grabbed ’em and put them back in the isolation unit. And when they did that, that freaked those inmates out because they’re scared of getting this [expletive], and they thought they’d just released the virus into that unit and contaminated them. The problem was, they didn’t educate the inmates on what’s going on. It’s basic corrections 101, communicating with the inmate population. Go down there and town hall them and educate them. They didn’t do that — they kicked ’em out and then jerked them back up, and you think, Oh, hell, they just brought an infected person down here, and now we’re all going to get this [expletive].
Don Cain, via email: I know one thing is, if I do pass, my family has one heck of a suit.
On April 17, a Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman responded to a detailed request for comment with a statement: “We want to point out that following a recent visit to F.C.C. Oakdale, the C.D.C. and the Louisiana Office of Public Health commended F.C.C. Oakdale staff and confirmed their compliance with current C.D.C. guidance for Covid management in correctional facilities. We direct you to our public website for detailed information about how the B.O.P. is taking aggressive steps to mitigate the spread of Covid in all of our facilities, including F.C.C. Oakdale.”
Ronald Morris, via text, April 10: Another inmate death — six. Positive inmates: 49. Positive staff: 26.
Correctional Officer 1: You don’t know. This could be the day that you have a temperature. Or this is going to be the day that you come in contact with somebody that’s going to get you sick. Every day when I come home kind of starts my 14 days over, where I can’t have contact with my family. It’s weighing on my wife, and it’s weighing on me. I’m starting to become a little withdrawn and short. I know that my stress rubs on to her and then rubs off to the kids. And it’s not just us. I’m sure it’s the health care providers, I’m sure it’s the local parish and state law enforcement, federal law enforcement, firefighters. I mean, we all probably feel the exact same way. We have no choice.
Mayor Paul: We don’t have a morgue at the Oakdale hospital. They have run in a portable morgue. It’s an 18-wheeler on the loading dock. I understand it is for all the surrounding hospitals if needed.
Correctional Officer 2: We’re still releasing inmates if it’s time for them to be released. When they’re going to leave here, they’re going to get on a Greyhound bus, probably change two or three different buses. One’s going, let’s say, to Houston, one is going to Georgia; we send inmates all over the United States. We send inmates to Puerto Rico. We send inmates everywhere. I have brought up that if we know that they’re getting out, then why are we not putting them in quarantine? Because an inmate could not have a fever 12 hours before he leaves, get on a plane or a bus, and as soon as he gets home, he tests positive. Well, then he’s contaminated all those people.
Ronald Morris: On Monday [April 13], the U.S. Marshals showed up with two what they said were “recovered” Covid-19 inmates and said we had to take ’em. So they’re quarantined. And I was very upset — my next question was: “Are we going to be the Covid-19 hub around here?” And they were like: “No, no, this is supposed to be a one-time deal.” But we’ll see.

On April 15, a seventh inmate died. Twenty inmates were hospitalized. Fifty-six inmates had tested positive for Covid-19. Thirty-two staff members had tested positive, along with three of their family members.
Correctional Officer 2: We just want to be protected. That’s all. My husband works here. And we have three children. I have elderly parents, his mother’s elderly. We don’t want to give this to anybody. And it’s terrifying whenever we hear, you know, somebody else has it, somebody else has it. We live here. This is where we’re from. This is our home.

Warns of Vaccine Roadblock,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/20/world/20virus-int-briefing-germanysub01/20virus-int-briefing-germanysub01-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
This briefing has ended. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic here.
Istanbul deaths suggest a wider outbreak than Turkey admits.Turkey has surpassed China in its number of confirmed coronavirus cases, as the tally rose to more than 90,000 by Monday, with deaths reaching at least 2,140, according to official government figures. But the true death toll may be much higher. 
Data compiled by The New York Times from records of deaths in Istanbul indicate that Turkey is grappling with a far bigger calamity from the coronavirus than official figures and statements indicate. The city alone recorded about 2,100 more deaths than expected from March 9 to April 12, based on weekly averages from the last two years, far more than officials reported for the whole of Turkey during that time. 
While not all those deaths are necessarily directly attributable to the coronavirus, the numbers indicate a striking jump in fatalities that has coincided with the onset of the outbreak, a preliminary indicator that is being used by researchers to cut through the fog of the pandemic and assess its full toll in real time. 
The government maintains that it acted swiftly, stopping flights and border crossings from five of the most affected countries in February and closing schools, restaurants and bars in mid-March when the first case of infection was confirmed. 
But by then, the statistics compiled by The Times show, the damage was done. And medical professionals say that Turkey did not do enough to halt international travelers, and neglected contact tracing and community care.
“In February, they did nothing, although it was known the disease was there,” Dr. Sinan Adiyaman, head of the Turkish Medical Association, said in an interview.
The government announced its first death from Covid-19 on March 17. But the statistics compiled by The Times suggest that even around that time, the number of deaths overall in Istanbul was already considerably higher than historical averages, an indication that the virus had arrived several weeks earlier.
Any death statistics in the midst of a pandemic are tricky to pin down and must be considered preliminary. Many European countries are engaged in trying to improve their death statistics, which they now acknowledge are incomplete.
There are many hurdles to developing and widely distributing a vaccine, a W.H.O. official warned.
The head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies program warned on Monday that even if a vaccine against the coronavirus were quickly developed, manufacturing and distributing it could prove extraordinarily difficult.
There is no approved treatment for or vaccine against infection with the coronavirus. More than two dozen companies have announced vaccine programs; at least three candidates already are in human trials.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has warned that a vaccine is at least 18 months away. Other experts say even that timeline is optimistic.
The development process is important, but manufacturers must begin planning to scale up manufacturing capacities to meet global demand when a successful vaccine is discovered, said Dr. Michael Ryan, head of the W.H.O.’s emergencies program.
Billions of people around the globe eventually may need vaccination. Modern vaccines, made with DNA and RNA, require specialized facilities; it is not clear who could make them.
And it will be important that vaccines go where they are most needed, not simply to the countries that can afford them. The W.H.O. is working with government leaders and nonprofits like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations to ensure that means for equitable vaccine distribution are in place when the time comes, Dr. Ryan said.
“We’ve worked for over 20 years trying to ensure that products like vaccines are distributed in emergencies on the basis of epidemiological need,” Dr. Ryan said at a news briefing. “We intend to do exactly the same here.”
The agency has a long history of distributing vaccines to countries in need, including the meningitis, yellow fever, cholera and polio vaccines. Yet mass vaccination campaigns are still logistically difficult and often met with resistance in the community.
“As a global health architecture, we’re not very good at delivering vaccines in people other than children — in adults,” Dr. Ryan said.
“If this is to work, it will require one of the greatest scientific, one of the greatest political, one of the greatest financial, one of the greatest public health operations in a generation,” he added.
Germany cautiously restarts its economy, allowing small shops to open.
Across Germany, smaller stores were allowed to open their doors on Monday for the first time in nearly a month, under initial measures to ease restrictions imposed in March as the coronavirus outbreak took hold. Germans are still required to stay at least five feet from one another at all times until the end of April. 
“We must not allow ourselves to be lulled into a false sense of security,” Chancellor Angela Merkel said at a news conference on Monday, warning that the consequences of the new measures would be visible only in two weeks’ time. “That is what makes the situation so difficult.”
Norway, the Czech Republic and Denmark, all lifted some restrictions on Monday, attempting to balance public health against economic revival. Across Europe, the confirmed coronavirus toll passed one million infections and 100,000 deaths, according to the European Center for Disease Control.
Rana Basar reopened her jewelry and accessories shop in the normally bustling Ottensen shopping district of Hamburg on Monday, but said it had been a quiet start.
“It is not like people are in the mood to go shopping,” she added.She prepared her store, Junajoux, with disinfectant and markings on the floor to help the two to three customers allowed in at a time to keep the required distance, as well as a mask to wear when customers are present. One of the biggest challenges, she said, was organizing care for her two children, because schools remain closed. 
“A lot of this has not been fully thought through,” Ms. Basar said.In Rostock, where the local zoo was one of several in the country allowed to reopen, around 1,000 people — roughly half of normal numbers — were expected to visit the animals that could be viewed from outside, as indoor exhibits remained closed. All large gatherings have been banned until the end of summer.
Germany has recorded 141,672 coronavirus cases, with 4,404 fatalities, but the rate of infection has been steadily slowing in recent days and the country’s health system has been able to cope with the strain.
The latest in science: Six feet between tables may not be enough distance to safely reopen restaurants.
In January, at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China, one diner infected with the novel coronavirus but not yet feeling sick appeared to have spread the disease to nine other people. One of the restaurant’s air-conditioners apparently blew the virus particles around the dining room.
There were 73 other diners who ate that day on the same floor of the five-story restaurant, and the good news is they did not become sick. Neither did the eight employees who were working on the floor at the time.
Chinese researchers described the incident in a paper that is to be published in the July issue of the Emerging Infectious Diseases, a journal published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The field study has limitations. The researchers, for example, did not perform experiments to simulate the airborne transmission.
That outbreak illustrates some of the challenges that restaurants will face when they try to reopen. Ventilation systems can create complex patterns of air flow and keep viruses aloft, so simply spacing tables six feet apart — the minimum distance that the C.D.C. advises you keep from other people — may not be sufficient to safeguard restaurant patrons.
The social nature of dining out could increase the risk. The longer people linger in a contaminated area, the more virus particles they would likely inhale. Eating is also one activity that cannot be accomplished while wearing a mask. Virus-laden droplets can be expelled into the air through breathing and talking, not just through coughs and sneezes.
On the other hand, all of the people who became sick at the restaurant in China were either at the same table as the infected person or at one of two neighboring tables. The fact that people farther away remained healthy is a hopeful hint that the coronavirus is primarily transmitted through larger respiratory droplets, which fall out of the air more quickly than smaller droplets known as aerosols, which can float for hours.
Filipino nurses work the front lines in foreign lands.
Each year about 13,000 nurses leave the Philippines for jobs in wealthier countries, sending money back home, often living in bare-bones conditions, far from familiar places and people.
Covid-19 has required them to make an additional sacrifice: risking their health and their lives  by caring for the sick. In places with major coronavirus outbreaks, nurses and doctors working in hospitals have been among the people most likely to become infected.  
The virus has killed at least seven Filipino employees of Britain’s National Health Service, and in the United States it has claimed the lives of at least five nurses and a doctor from the Philippines.
The threat is as real as can be to Jhoanna Mariel Buendia, 27, a nurse who treats Covid-19 patients in the intensive care unit of a hospital in York, England.
Last month, her aunt, Araceli Buendia Ilagan, 63, an associate supervisor in the cardiac surgical intensive care unit of a hospital in Miami, died of the disease. An uncle, a nurse in California, is hospitalized with the virus.
Ms. Buendia is one of four nurses from the Philippines sharing a house in York.“The common denominator is that we’re all scared,” she said.
Western countries rely heavily on health care workers from other parts of the world — about one-sixth of the nurses working in the United States are immigrants — and even with that recruitment, there are labor shortages. The Philippines produce particularly large numbers of nurses.
In response to the pandemic, the Philippine government has temporarily barred health workers from leaving the country, saying that going abroad would put them at risk, and that they were needed at home.
As new U.S. hotspots emerge and Washington stays at an impasse, governors grapple with reopening.
As Massachusetts and some prisons become hotspots of the coronavirus outbreak in the United States, President Trump and Democratic lawmakers remained deadlocked on Monday over a bill to keep paychecks flowing to small business employees.
More evidence emerged that New York, the hardest-hit state, had reached a plateau — a tragically high one — as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo reported 478 more Covid-19 deaths, the lowest one-day figure in more than two weeks. (The state’s total of more than 14,000 deaths does not count what New York City says are 3,700 presumed Covid-19 deaths among people who were never tested for the virus.)
In some parts of the country, the virus continues to spread quickly. Massachusetts now has the third-most confirmed infections of any state, with more than 38,000, and the fourth-most deaths, with more than 1,700.
A New York Times analysis shows that four of the country’s 10 largest sources of new infections are prisons or jails. An Ohio state prison is the biggest source, with 1,828 inmates and 103 employees infected.
More than 770,000 people nationwide have tested positive for the novel coronavirus and more than 37,000 have died, according to data collected by The Times — and experts say the true figures are likely much higher.
New York offered a small suggestion of good news on Monday, starting a program to test people for coronavirus antibodies. The accuracy of the testing remains in question, but if successful, it could indicate how many people have some immunity and who they are, which are important steps toward jumpstarting the economy.
 Singapore seemed to have coronavirus under control. Then cases doubled.
After recording its first coronavirus case on Jan. 23, Singapore did almost everything right.The prosperous city-state traced the close contacts of every infected patient, shut the borders to populations likely to carry the contagion, and provided free testing and treatment.  
But over the past few days, Singapore’s caseload has more than doubled, with more than 8,000 cases confirmed as of Monday, the highest in Southeast Asia. Most of the new infections are within crowded dormitories where low-paid migrant laborers from South Asia and China live, unnoticed by many of the country’s richer residents and, it turns out, the government itself.
The group proved a major blind spot in the coronavirus pandemic, exposing the starkly different experiences of rich expatriates and poorer ones in a city-state where 40 percent of residents are foreign born. 
Most of the cases among migrant workers are mild or asymptomatic, and none have required critical care, perhaps explaining why the dormitory outbreaks at first went unnoticed. In total, 11 people in Singapore have died of Covid-19, a relatively low fatality rate. 
Tens of thousands of Singaporeans have donated funds for the well-being of migrant workers, and the expectation is that the government will deliver on its vow to treat them better. For now, though, the country is reeling from the pandemic’s assault on some of its most defenseless people.
Iran eases restrictions on some businesses.
Iran continued its gradual rebooting of its economy on Monday by reopening traditional bazaars and modern shopping malls and lifting travel restrictions around the country.
The government has called its plan “smart distancing,” rather than the strict social distancing measures imposed by most other countries hoping to flatten the rate of infection as they fight the coronavirus pandemic. But not much distancing was observed as commuters packed trains and buses and shoppers crowded the narrow, winding passageways that shape Tehran’s traditional bazaar.
President Hassan Rouhani of Iran said he was considering opening religious shrines, a potential vector for spreading the virus, two weeks earlier than scheduled based on requests from custodians of the religious centers.
Health officials in the country, one of the first outside China to be hit hard by the virus, continued to warn that another surge of patients and deaths was inevitable. Different branches of the government sent conflicting messages to the public about the pros and cons of easing restrictions while the contagion had not been contained, testing was not widely available and the numbers of patients and deaths continued to surge.
“Contact among the public has increased with the opening of shopping centers and people moving around on public transportation,” said Alireza Zali, the head of Iran’s coronavirus relief committee. There has been a steady increase in people contracting the virus and being hospitalized, Mr. Zali said, including a 2 percent increase in patients being admitted to intensive care units within the past 24 hours.
The health ministry said on Monday that 1,294 new cases were reported in the past 24 hours and that 91 people had died. Iran’s official tally stands at 5,209 people dead and 83,505 infected. 
Oil prices nosedived as the worldwide surplus grew.
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday over growing concerns that the collapse in demand has far outstripped attempts to curb production and store the excess supply.
The price of the main U.S. benchmark, West Texas Intermediate, actually fell below zero — meaning that some sellers, fearing they would be unable to sell the oil and would have no place to put it, were willing to pay people to take it.
That stunning drop was largely a short-term aberration driven by the timing of futures contracts, but it highlighted the underlying severe damage to oil markets from the worldwide glut. 
Other oil prices, less affected by futures, also fell, but not as drastically. Brent crude, an international benchmark, dropped more than 6 percent, below $27 a barrel — less than half its price two months ago.
[Analysis: Oil collapse and covid-19 create toxic geopolitical stew.]Stocks slumped, as well, with the S&P 500 index losing 1.8 percent on the day. 
With much of the world in lockdown because of the pandemic, global demand for oil has collapsed, leading to record surpluses.
On April 12, major exporters like Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed to cut production by 9.7 million barrels a day, beginning in May, but that was not nearly enough to compensate for the drop in demand. Analysts estimate that consumption in April will have fallen by three times that amount.
At the same time, oil storage tanks in the United States, especially in the crucial site of Cushing, Okla., are nearing their limits. 
As a result, investors have little interest in bidding in the current round of West Texas Intermediate futures trading, which expires on Tuesday, for delivery of oil in May. Under those futures contracts, the crude is delivered to Cushing, but investors are worried that there will be no room to store it there.
The next futures contract for West Texas Intermediate, for delivery in June, fell about 12 percent on Monday, to around $22 a barrel.
Iraq begins to lift restrictions.
Iraqis will join a growing list of nations that are starting to lift restrictions as they continue fighting the coronavirus.
 The Iraqi government decided Monday to loosen a curfew it has had in place for nearly five weeks. It will allow some government employees to return to work and also some private sector workers, including those working in clothing stores and on construction sites.
Iraqis will be allowed to leave their home and neighborhoods from 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. for work or for buying food or going to pharmacies or medical appointments.
“Those who are carpenters, blacksmiths, car mechanics, barbers and others are permitted to work during the day as long as no more than three people are in the establishment at one time,” the official order said. Electricians and computer store workers are also included.
Mosques will remain closed and so will restaurants, sporting events and cinemas. Iraq has a relatively low number of cases, 1,574 as of April 20, and 82 deaths.
Iran, which shares a 1,000 mile border with Iraq, has also begun a gradual return to normal life.Russians in the Caucasus mountains march shoulder-to-shoulder to protest lockdown measures.In scenes reminiscent of anti-lockdown protests last week in Michigan and Wisconsin, hundreds of Russians took to the streets of a city in the Caucasus mountains on Monday demanding the resignation of the local governor and the lifting of his stay-at-home order.
The protest in Vladikavkaz, the capital of North Ossetia, was organized by political opponents of the governor, Vyacheslav Bitarov, a Kremlin ally who was appointed to his post by President Vladimir V. Putin in 2016.
Unlike President Trump, Mr. Putin has urged citizens to obey quarantine restrictions and show “discipline and responsibility” in managing an outbreak that he described on Sunday as “under total control” but still not at its peak in Russia.
A mainly Christian pocket in a largely Muslim region, North Ossetia has a long record of loyalty to Moscow, which it looks to for protection and funding. The pandemic, however, has scrambled allegiances and political calculations.
Videos on social media showed people marching shoulder-to-shoulder in Vladikavkaz, in violation of social distancing recommendations backed by the Kremlin. They chanted slogans against the regional government and called on Mr. Bitarov to resign.
As has happened in other countries, anger at business closures and restrictions on movement has fed pre-existing political feuds and rage over corruption. Mr. Bitarov’s demands that people stay home caused fury amid reports that a brewery he owns has been exempted from the lockdown.
Among those supporting the protest was Vadim Cheldiev, a prominent coronavirus skeptic who has dismissed the pandemic as a hoax. In a video posted online on Monday, he said coronavirus “doesn’t exist” but was a pretext to “establish total control over us all.”
OVD Info, a Russian group that monitors arrests, reported that the police detained two suspected organizers of the demonstration, along with several protesters. Officers in riot gear cordoned off government buildings in the city center and drove a crowd of demonstrators from a central square.
Russian news outlets blamed the protest on supporters of Vitaly Kaloev, an infamous former businessman and member of the regional council. Mr. Kaloev was jailed in Switzerland in 2004 for the murder of a Swiss air traffic controller whom he blamed for a plane crash that killed his wife and children.
Released from prison after just three years following intense lobbying by Moscow, Mr. Kaloev returned to a hero’s welcome in North Ossetia, but has bridled in recent years at being passed over by the Kremlin in favor of Mr. Bitarov.
At some hospitals in Israel, relatives can visit dying Covid-19 patients.
Several Israeli hospitals have begun to allow deathbed visits by family members of coronavirus patients, breaking with the strict ban that is in place across much of the world.
Proponents say that one or two relatives making short bedside visits while clothed head-to-toe in protective gear is manageable for hospital workers, and that the benefits outweigh the costs.
Ronni Gamza, chief executive of Tel Aviv’s Sourasky Medical Center, said his hospital had adhered to the “default position” of barring all family visits to the coronavirus ward, but said it was over-the-top and, in his view, inhumane.
“We had anxiety, narrow thinking, a little bit of hysteria, and we were too conservative,” he said. Israel’s hospitals have not been overrun like those in some countries, and the new visitation policy has been embraced by several major Israeli hospitals including Sheba Medical Center in Tel Hashomer, and Shaare Tzedek and Hadassah hospitals in Jerusalem.
Family visits, Dr. Gamzu said, require “less than one percent” of all the personal protective equipment his hospital uses. At peaks in the numbers of critical patients, Dr. Gamzu said, “You could say, ‘We are sorry, we do not have the capacity now.’ But to take that as a standard?”
Dr. Gamzu said he was urging Israeli health authorities to open nursing homes up for visits as well. 
Elisheva Stern was one of the first relatives given the chance to visit a dying patient, when she came to her father’s bedside earlier this month. “None of us want to say bye to our family,” she said. “But it’s really a gift.”
Those we’ve lost: Luis Sepúlveda, a noted Chilean writer exiled by Pinochet. ImageLuis Sepúlveda, the Chilean novelist, was jailed by the Pinochet regime and then sent into exile. He died in Spain, hospitalized there early on in the pandemic.Credit...Marta Fernandez/Europa Press, via Associated Press
Luis Sepúlveda, a Chilean writer whose stay among Indigenous people in the Amazon led to his most celebrated novel and who was jailed during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, died April 16 in Oviedo, Spain. He was 70.
The cause was the novel coronavirus, according to Tusquets, his publishing house in Barcelona. Mr. Sepúlveda, who was hospitalized in February, was among the first wave of people in Spain to be diagnosed.
Mr. Sepúlveda published several novels, children’s stories and travel books, and he also wrote and directed films. He acquired fame with his novel “The Old Man Who Read Love Stories” (1988), which tells the story of a man who, together with his wife, leaves his mountain village to take part in the colonization of the Amazon.
The book was inspired by Mr. Sepúlveda’s stay in the 1970s with the region’s Shuar Indigenous people. A review in The New York Times by David Unger compared it to one of the early works of Gabriel García Márquez.
“In its simple language and philosophical underpinnings, it is magical, thanks to the author’s skill at describing jungle life,” Mr. Unger wrote. Mr. Sepúlveda wrote the screenplay for a 2001 movie version starring Richard Dreyfuss.
Spain’s outbreak is easing, but its economic woes are just beginning. 
Spain said on Monday that 399 people had died from the coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, the smallest daily percentage increase since a lockdown was imposed in mid-March, up just 1.9 percent up from the previous day. The number of people discharged from hospital is continuing to rise, now surpassing 80,000 recoveries, another sign of improvement. 
But another report released on Monday was far less heartening: The country’s central bank warned that the Spanish economy could shrink as much as 13.6 percent this year. It also said that unemployment could rise to almost 22 percent, even excluding the thousands of workers whose contracts have been temporarily suspended under a government program designed to avoid mass layoffs. Spain’s jobless rate was almost 14 percent in February, before the outbreak took hold.
Spain’s restrictions on movement have been some of the strictest in Europe, including orders to keep children inside. A nationwide lockdown has been extended into May, but the government has started rolling back some limits, allowing construction sites and factories to reopen. 
Italy, like Spain, is moving carefully toward restoring economic activity, while Britain and France have signaled that they will not relax restrictions until next month. 
The restrictions on Spain’s children are set to be loosened starting April 27, though the government has not given details on the changes. Fernando Simón, the director of the national center for health emergencies, said on Monday that it was important to clarify that “children will be able to get out on the street, but it will not be a free exit, to play.” 
He added: “It’s not about opening the door and having the neighbors come out.”As it considers reopening the economy, Spain is struggling to recount its dead. The latest figures from the Health Ministry do not match recent adjustments in regions that have taken into account data from funeral homes.
Djokovic would prefer not to get vaccinated to resume playing, but doesn’t rule it out.
Novak Djokovic, the world’s top ranked men’s tennis player, said on Sunday that he would have a difficult decision to make if receiving a coronavirus vaccine became a mandatory condition for competing on the circuit when play resumes.
“Personally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn’t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,” Djokovic said in comments reported and translated by Reuters. “But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don’t know.”
Djokovic, the 32-year-old Serbian star who has won 17 Grand Slam singles titles, was speaking with a group of Serbian players on a live Facebook chat when he made the comment. Djokovic is staying in Spain with his wife Jelena and their two children during the lockdown.
In a statement released on Monday through his management team, he declined to say whether he opposed vaccines in general. He made it clear he was intent on exploring other options, but did not rule vaccination out if it became compulsory.
The professional tennis tour has been shut down because of the virus since early March and will resume no sooner than July 13. Wimbledon has been canceled for the first time since 1945 and dozens of tournaments, including the French Open, which was scheduled to be the next Grand Slam tournament, have been postponed.
Wuhan lab rejects U.S. accusation that it was source of outbreak.
The Trump administration suggested that a Chinese laboratory may have been the source of the coronavirus outbreak, but a senior scientist at the lab in question has rejected the accusations, saying there are no signs that the virus was the product of human tampering.
The scientist, Yuan Zhiming, the director of a high-security virus research lab that is part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, pushed back against the surge of speculation that the lab may have accidentally leaked the virus or was part of a conspiracy to release it.
“Without any evidence, and without any relationship to logic, he makes these allegations that are totally founded on speculation,” Mr. Yuan said of Senator Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who was an early proponent of the theory that the lab was the origin of the virus.
“I’ve long engaged in biosecurity management and project management in laboratories, and I know this would have been impossible,” Mr. Yuan said in an interview aired over the weekend by CGTN, the Chinese television broadcaster.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said last week that the Chinese government “needs to come clean” about the lab, and President Trump has kept the speculation alive, telling reporters that “more and more we’re hearing the story.”
But most scientists have dismissed the idea that the laboratory, built with French assistance, could have been the incubator, even inadvertently, of the new coronavirus. The French government has also said that there was no evidence of a link between the coronavirus and the lab.
But Mr. Yuan also ruefully suggested that no denial would halt the suspicions. “I’m also sure that as long as the outbreak continues, especially abroad, these suspicions or discordant voices will never disappear,” he said.
After second wave of infection, Hong Kong has first day with no new cases.
Hong Kong reported no new coronavirus cases on Monday, the first time since a second wave of imported infections hit the semiautonomous Chinese city in early March that there were no new daily infections. 
The city has recorded 1,026 cases and four deaths since January, but cases tripled after residents returned to the city from hot spots in the United States and Europe last month. Hong Kong closed its borders to all nonresidents and shut gyms, movie theaters and government offices, and residents returning to the city are tested before they are allowed to return home for two weeks of self isolation. Fewer than 10 new cases were reported in more than a week.
The government also announced on Monday that residents returning to the city on late afternoon or evening flights would be required to stay overnight at a designated hotel until they are able to receive test results the following day.
Medical experts warned that the city would have to record at least two incubation periods — or 28 days — before they could rule out further outbreaks, adding that many carriers of the disease do not show symptoms or fall ill.
Despite the downward trend in transmissions, social distancing restrictions are still in place in Hong Kong. Schools have been closed since late January, and final exams that normally take place in late April were canceled. Government offices, gyms and movie theaters remain closed, and gatherings of more than four people are banned.
Australia and New Zealand ease lockdowns as new infections drop.
Australia and New Zealand announced plans on Monday to ease lockdown restrictions as both countries have managed so far to control coronavirus outbreaks, reporting  just a few new infections each day.
Careful and calibrated, the plans include a return to school for some children in the coming weeks as well as allowances for slightly more business activity, more freedom to exercise outdoors and the potential for gatherings of more than two people.
In Sydney, a few beaches reopened for exercise on Monday, leading to the return of surfers. In Maroubra, a coastal southern suburb, lifeguards used megaphones to warn surfers, runners and swimmers to stay physically distanced.
Many who ventured out expressed relief and awe at what the past month had brought. “I’m just kind of laughing,” said Paul Beswich, 55, one of many residents who welcomed the chance to go for a swim. “I’ve lived here all my life, and we’ve always been told that if you’ve got a virus, go flush it out in the water. Now we can.”
Australia and New Zealand have benefited from an early, aggressive response to the pandemic. In Australia, public health laboratories started building test kits in January.
As of Monday, the country had tested more than 422,000 people, and confirmed 6,619 confirmed and 71 deaths. None of its hospitals are overwhelmed. For eight straight days, the country has recorded fewer than 50 new cases, after a daily peak of nearly 500 on March 28. That was roughly when the government asked people to stay home, with the exception of essential activities, including shopping and exercise.
New Zealand’s restrictions were more severe, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announcing a total lockdown on March 25, asking New Zealanders to act as if they had the virus. The restrictions produced a result roughly in line with Australia’s. New Zealand has recorded just over 1,100 infections and 12 deaths after conducting 85,000 tests from a population of nearly 4.9 million.
Starting next Monday, it will begin to allow slightly more activity. Construction will be allowed to restart. Schools will reopen as of April 28 to some students, and funerals and weddings of up to 10 people could be allowed.
“Stay strong, stay home, be kind, and let’s finish what we started,” Ms. Ardern said on Monday.
U.S. ambassador in Kenya ignites outrage over virus criticism. 
Comments from the top United States diplomat in Kenya have caused an uproar after he said that only a small part of the country’s population was adhering to rules aimed at curbing the spread of the coronavirus.
In a Twitter post on Sunday, the ambassador, Kyle McCarter, wrote, “Only a fraction of the wananchi are wearing masks and social distancing,” using the Swahili word for citizens. 
“None of us know the magnitude of this Wuhan flu,” he continued, “but we must take basic known wise precautions. It is only for a short time.”
The comment sparked outrage, with some noting that social distancing was an unimaginable luxury for poor people living in overcrowded and cramped conditions. Others also questioned how he came to his conclusion given that Nairobi was on partial lockdown and movement in and out of the city was banned. Mr. McCarter doubled down writing in a follow-up post, “The further you get from Nairobi the less compliance there is. Trust me.”
When Twitter user Allan Ogera questioned him on the number of masks the United States has donated to Kenya, Mr. McCarter retorted, “You would not be able to test in Kenya if not for USA marafiki,” which means ‘friends’ in Swahili.
Some social media users also criticized the ambassador’s decision to call the coronavirus “Wuhan flu,” saying he was “trying to please” President Trump who nominated him for the post in 2019 and who has insisted on calling the coronavirus the “Chinese virus.” The disease is thought to have first emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan.
Kenya has 270 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to the latest figures, and a total of 14 deaths. To curb the spread of the virus, authorities have mandated the wearing of masks, imposed a nationwide dusk to dawn curfew, closed the biggest shopping district in the capital  and introduced partial lockdowns in four out of the country’s 47 counties.
Thousands who died in Italy’s nursing homes were not counted among fatalities. 
The coronavirus outbreak tore through communities in northern Italy and overwhelmed the health care system with such force that only now is the true scale of the outbreak beginning to emerge. Like other hard-hit countries, including China and Spain, Italy has had to revisit its tally of the dead. 
Health experts in Italy say they now believe thousands of nursing home residents were initially unaccounted for. A recent survey by Italy’s national health institute estimated that 40.2 percent of the 6,773 people who died in Italian nursing homes between Feb 1 and April 14  had either a confirmed case of Covid-19 or symptoms consistent with the infection. 
“We observed that most deaths occurred in the second half of March, at the peak of the Covid infection, while some of the earlier deaths coincided with the influenza season,” said Graziano Onder, director of the Aging Department at the National Health Institute, which presented the data on Friday. Only the 364 nursing home residents who had tested positive were included in the official toll kept by the country’s Civil Protection Department.
The actual number of Covid-19 deaths in these nursing homes may never be known because initially testing was infrequent. 
“Because the swabs were so difficult to obtain, at first priority was given to hospitals,” Dr. Onder said. “Only more recently were nursing homes added to the priority list.” 
About a third of Italy’s 3,420 public or publicly funded nursing homes, which serve around 80,000 people, participated in the survey, which also sought to monitor the difficulties these structures faced during the early weeks of the outbreak. Shortages of masks, gloves and other protective equipment were reported most frequently.

This briefing has ended. Read global live updates on the coronavirus here. 

Countries around the world are weighing the costs and benefits of reopening society.The coronavirus pandemic continued its global assault on Saturday, with more than 1.7 million known cases recorded worldwide and at least 107,000 deaths. 
But even as some countries join the list of those with broad lockdown orders and others maintain or extend sweeping shutdowns, others have begun eyeing the benefits of reopening at least some parts of society.
In Iran, the hardest-hit country so far in its region, some government offices and shops, factories and other businesses began reopening on Saturday as the national lockdown is lifted in phases. President Hassan Rouhani had said last week that economic and government activity must continue. On Saturday, he said that people should still observe social distancing.
The lifting of restrictions came despite warnings from the country’s health ministry that the reopening could cause a new spike in cases and tens of thousands of additional deaths. 
Some of the most grievously hit countries in Europe, while still recording hundreds of new deaths every day, say that the worst appears to be past. Their plans to ease some restrictions, they caution, will not bring normalcy, but instead a new phase of learning how to safely live with the pandemic.
[Analysis: Oil collapse and covid-19 create toxic geopolitical stew.]Spain, with the world’s highest caseload after the United States, is preparing to allow some nonessential employees to return to work on Monday. The country has reported a falling death rate and a daily growth in new cases of about 3 percent, compared with 20 percent in mid-March.
But officials stressed the limits of that easing. “Spain continues in a state of lockdown,” Health Minister Salvador Illa warned  on Friday. “We are not yet in a de-escalation phase.”
Italy, which follows Spain in cases but has the highest death toll after the United States, will allow some bookstores, children’s clothing shops and some forestry-related occupations to resume operations after the current restrictions expire on Tuesday. 
Austria plans to reopen smaller shops after this weekend. The Czech Republic is opening small stores, and people can play tennis and go swimming.  Denmark may reopen kindergartens and schools starting next week, Norway will allow pupils to attend kindergarten.
And China has ended its lockdown of Wuhan, where the coronavirus first emerged.For many countries, the question of whether to ease restrictions does not have a clear answer yet. In the United States, President Trump — and governors of each state — are balancing calls from medical experts to keep restrictions in place with pleas from bankers, corporate executives and industrialists to ease them.
India, on the other hand, appears set to extend a 21-day lockdown for all 1.3 billion citizens for two more weeks, carrying it to the end of April. During a meeting with top officials, Mr. Modi said the lockdown had helped blunt the outbreak but that “constant vigilance is paramount,” according to a statement from his office.
Some countries put in place new measures. Turkey on Friday ordered a two-day curfew for 31 provinces. And Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has ordered air traffic to the country halted after more than 70 people who arrived from Newark, N.J., on Saturday morning left Ben Gurion Airport without official verifications of their mandatory quarantine plans and checks of their temperatures.
A Times examination reveals the extent of President Trump’s slow response to the virus, which has now claimed more than 20,000 lives in the U.S. 
Throughout January, as President Trump repeatedly played down the seriousness of the virus and focused on other issues, an array of figures inside his government — from top White House advisers to experts deep in the cabinet departments and intelligence agencies — identified the threat, sounded alarms and made clear the need for aggressive action.
Dozens of interviews and a review of emails and other records by The New York Times revealed many previously unreported details of the roots and extent of Mr. Trump’s halting response.  Read the full investigation. 
The country now has more than 515,000 confirmed cases, by far the world’s largest count, and more than 20,000 deaths, surpassing Italy’s as the world’s heaviest toll.  More than 16 million Americans have lost their jobs. 
Here’s what else is happening in the United States:On Saturday,  the U.S. surpassed Italy in the total number of confirmed deaths from the coronavirus with 20,109. Government projections obtained by The New York Times  found that without any mitigation, the death toll from the virus could have reached 300,000 — and that it could reach 200,000 if the Trump administration lifts 30-day stay-at-home orders.  Read the latest updates for the United States. Christians across the United States prepared to celebrate Easter by gathering virtually on Sunday, largely following stay-at-home orders and guidance from health officials. A handful of lone pastors in states like Louisiana and Mississippi plan to hold in-person services in defiance of restrictions on mass gatherings, citing their religious freedoms. President Trump said in a tweet that he will watch the online service of First Baptist Dallas, led by Robert Jeffress, one of his prominent supporters.The largest states are split on when and how to reopen. The governors of Texas and Florida, both Republicans, have started talking about reopening businesses and schools, echoing signals from Mr. Trump. But the leaders of California and New York, both Democrats, are sounding more cautious notes. Top officials in New York,  the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak with more than 180,000 cases, appear to disagree over whether New York City schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year.  Read the latest updates for the New York region.Citing the virus, the Trump administration announced that it would issue visa penalties on countries that refuse to accept people the U.S. aims to deport. With so many restaurants and schools closed and other sources of demand disrupted, many of the largest farms in the country are  being forced to destroy tens of millions of pounds of fresh food that they haven’t been able to sell or donate to food banks, which can only absorb so much perishable food.
As coronavirus cases rise in Latin America, murder rates fall.
As countries contend with escalating body counts from the pandemic, some are experiencing an unanticipated decline in a different form of death: murder.
Lockdowns have reduced opportunities for homicides and other crimes, and the virus has taken some criminals out of action as they hunker down in their homes. Some gangs have even led efforts to impose curfews in neighborhoods where they hold sway.
The drop in murders is especially notable in Latin America, the region with the highest homicide rates in the world outside of war. 
In El Salvador, for example, there were just 65 homicides in March, down from 114 in February. Neighboring Honduras has also seen a falloff in killings in recent weeks, as has Colombia and the most populous state in Mexico.
The pandemic is “taking people off the streets,” said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico City. “The rule of thumb is: the stricter the lockdown, the bigger the effect on crimes committed against strangers on the street.”
Here are other developments in the pandemic around the world:Italy’s coronavirus outbreak is one of the world’s deadliest, counting more than 152,000 cases and more than 19,450 deaths. Health care workers have been hard-hit, and so has another force on the front lines: The virus has killed nearly 100 priests.France, which has the world’s fifth largest known outbreak, reported on Saturday that the total number of patients in intensive care fell for the third day in a row, to roughly 6,880. With nearly 94,000 cases, the country has logged more than 13,800 deaths.Tokyo reported a record number of new cases on Saturday, at 197. The city has confirmed a total of 40 deaths from the virus. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Japan had not yet hit its target of reducing commuting by at least 70 percent, and asked all businesses to let employees work from home.Chile will start handing out certificates to people who have recovered that will exempt them from quarantines and other restrictions.The World Health Organization said that it was looking into reports of some recovering Covid-19 patients testing positive again after testing negative, a day after South Korean officials said that 91 previously cleared patients had tested positive again. Jeong Eun-kyeong, the director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a briefing that the virus might have been “reactivated” rather than the patients being reinfected.
China delays exports of ventilators and other crucial medical supplies for quality checks.
The Chinese government has ordered that no more N95 respirators, ventilators, hospital gowns and other key medical supplies be exported until customs officials perform quality inspections on each shipment.
The new policy, announced by China’s General Administration of Customs on Friday, produced immediate delays to cargos on Saturday as manufacturers, freight agents and traders tried to understand how to comply. China is the world’s dominant producer of a wide range of medical supplies, and its manufacturing lead has widened in many sectors as it has engaged in a nationwide mobilization of medical supplies production since late January.
The Chinese customs agency said that it had previously checked whether medical supplies were accurately counted, whether they infringed foreign patents and other intellectual property, and whether they had fraudulent documents. But now the agency will also assess the quality of goods.
The agency gave no indication of how long the quality testing might take.The policy comes after a series of complaints from Europe that medical supplies from China had problems. Chinese officials have countered that many of these supplies were industrial respirators that were not designed to meet medical standards and should not be expected to do so.
The new rules cover China’s exports in 11 categories: medical respirators and surgical masks, medical protective clothing, infrared thermometers, ventilators, surgical caps, medical goggles, medical gloves, medical shoe covers, patient monitors, medical disinfection towels and medical disinfectants.
Montreal police open a criminal investigation into deaths at a nursing home.
The police in Montreal said on Saturday night that they had launched a criminal investigation into a private residence for the elderly after 31 people had died there since March 13, at least five of them from confirmed cases of Covid-19.
Quebec’s premier, François Legault, said that the government had learned of the deaths at the 150-bed Résidence Herron, in a suburb west of Montreal, on Friday, and that he believed they amounted to “gross negligence.”
“This is terrible what happened,” Mr. Legault said on Saturday, adding that when officials from the regional health authority had arrived at the residence on March 29 to investigate, “almost all the staff was gone.” 
At that point, he said, the authority dispatched a team of health workers to care for the residents, and it has now taken over the running of the residence.
An investigation by Montreal Gazette, a local newspaper, said that residents had been discovered unfed and wearing clothing covered with feces.
Mr. Legault said that it was “unacceptable” how the elderly were being cared for in Quebec, and that staff shortages and insufficient salaries had been an ongoing issue at privately run residences. “I am not proud to see what is happening,” he said.
Résidence Herron is owned by a Quebec real estate company called Katasa, which owns six other retirement residences. The company was not immediately available for comment on Saturday. But it previously said it had been doing its best under challenging circumstances.
Quebec has been hit hard by the coronavirus. As of Saturday, it had 12,292 confirmed cases and 289 deaths. More than 90 percent of those who have died were 70 or older.
Officials said Saturday that after one resident at the Herron had tested positive for the virus, regional health authorities had reached out to the residence to learn more about the status of its residents, but were rebuffed. The authorities then obtained a court order to gain access to medical files, and learned of the number of deaths on Friday.
Quebec’s minister of health, Danielle McCann, ordered checks of private residences for the elderly across the province.
More than 50 workers chose isolation at their power plant to keep Vienna’s lights on.
The global pandemic has forced countless people into isolation. In Vienna, for the sake of the entire city, 53 people volunteered.
They raised their hands to ensure that whatever else happens, the power plants that provide electricity to Austria’s capital and its 2 million people would keep running.
The 53 employees of the Wien Energie company have been holed up in four power plants since March 20, after volunteering to go into their own version of a lockdown until April 16. Depending on how things go, they could be asked to stay on longer.
The workers miss their families, but shrug off the idea that they are making a big sacrifice, pointing out that doctors, nurses and other health workers had it much tougher.
“We are just a cog in a much bigger wheel,” said Steven Sacher, 24, an engineer at the Flötzersteig plant.
Wien Energie turned conference rooms into dormitories, and outfitted the plants with washing machines, fitness equipment, wireless internet — and, crucially, board games and jigsaw puzzles.
“We have finished about 20 puzzles with 2,000 pieces,” Mr. Wallner said. “Everyone who has time stops and works on it a bit.”
Mr. Sacher said his team has been piecing together a puzzle showing the Brooklyn Bridge at night, which gives way to an evening ritual.
“Every night at 9 p.m. sharp, the four of us who aren’t working get together and play Parcheesi,” he said.
Pope Francis will say Easter Mass and deliver an annual message by live-stream. 
Last year, the Vatican’s police force estimated that 70,000 faithful crammed into St. Peter’s Square on Easter morning to hear the pope deliver his “Urbi et Orbi” (“To the City and to the World”) message after the Easter Mass.
But on Sunday, Pope Francis won’t impart his Easter message and blessing from a window in the apostolic palace, from where he greets the faithful most Sundays. Instead, Francis will live-stream the Mass, followed by the message and a blessing, on the Vatican news website, starting at 11 a.m. local time (5 a.m. Eastern).
People are prohibited from gathering in the square. And the Francis will celebrate Mass with just a few assistants inside the empty basilica. 
The Vatican also live-streamed the Via Crucis, the traditional Good Friday procession that evokes the Stations of the Cross leading up to Christ’s crucifixion, in St. Peter’s Square instead of Rome’s Colosseum, where it is traditionally held. At the end of the procession, Francis prayed silently before a wooden crucifix that had been carried during Rome’s 16th-century plague. 
Earlier Friday, Francis called an Italian state TV Good Friday special to say he felt close to the victims of the pandemic, and that he was thinking about the “doctors, nurses, nuns and priests who had died on the front lines as soldiers, giving their life for love.”
In this pandemic, many are resisting, in their communities, in hospitals, caring for the ill. “Even today people are crucified, and die for love,” Francis said.
At over 100 years old, they’ve defied the odds and beat the virus.
As the coronavirus pandemic takes a disproportionate toll on older people around the world, several over the age of 100 have survived the brutal toll the disease takes on the body.
Cornelia Ras, 107, of the Netherlands is believed to be the oldest known survivor of the new coronavirus. She became ill last month after attending a church service on the island of Goeree-Overflakkee in the southwest part of the country. 
Ms. Ras was given the all clear by her doctor on Monday.“We did not expect her to survive this,” her niece Maaike de Groot told the Dutch newspaper AD. “She takes no medicines, still walks well and gets down on her knees every night to thank the Lord. From the looks of it, she will be able to continue to do so.”
Keith Watson, a 101-year-old man from western England, was in a hospital last month awaiting surgery when he developed a fever that prompted doctors to test him for the coronavirus, local health officials said.
But he pulled through, and on Thursday, he was discharged after recovering from the virus. “He’s amazing for his age,” his daughter-in-law Jo Watson told the BBC. 
On March 9, Ada Zanusso, 103, was one of several residents of a nursing home in the town of Lessona, Italy, to become ill with the coronavirus. Twenty people had already died there, the newspaper La Repubblica reported.
“She was ill for a week, even with critical moments,” said Carla Furno Marchese, Mrs. Zanusso’s family doctor since 1986, who also works with the nursing home.
Then, “miraculously,” Dr. Furno Marchese said in an interview, Ms. Zanusso improved. “She reacquired some strength, started eating again and then she got out of bed,” the doctor said. “Now she’s perfectly normal, like before. She’s doing great. She remembers everything.”
Her recovery has been embraced by many Italians still reeling from the toll the virus has taken on the country, which is enduring a lockdown. Ms. Zanusso had lived alone at home until four years ago, when she broke her femur and her children decided she would be better off in a care home. She had always been in good health, and has a deep faith.
 “She accepts everything that happens to her,” the doctor said.
Tech giants team up to track the virus, as South Korea tightens its leading program.
In one of the most far-ranging attempts to halt the spread of the coronavirus, Apple and Google said they were building software into smartphones that would tell people if they were recently in contact with someone who was infected with it.
The technology giants, usually fierce rivals, said they aimed to release the tool within several months, building it into the operating systems of billions of iPhones and Android devices around the world. 
Users would opt in and voluntarily report if they became infected, and the smartphones would log other devices they came near, enabling “contact tracing” of the disease, a measure that has proved effective, alongside mass testing in places like South Korea.  
“It could be a useful tool, but it raises privacy issues,” said Dr. Mike Reid, an assistant professor of medicine and infectious diseases at the University of California, San Francisco, who is helping San Francisco officials with contact tracing. “It’s not going to be the sole solution, but as part of a robust sophisticated response, it has a role to play.”
South Korea, which has used a government-issued tracking app to trace contacts and enforce quarantine, said on Saturday that it planned to strap tracking wristbands on those who violated self-quarantine orders.
Health officials worry that some of the 57,000 people who are under orders to stay home for two weeks have slipped out, leaving their smartphones behind. 
Yoon Tae-ho, a senior disease-control official, told reporters on Saturday that the bands would be deployed within two weeks.
Officials admitted that they lacked a legal power to enforce wristband-wearing, but could consider lighter quarantine-breaking penalties to those who agreed to wear them. 
South Korea has reported between 27 and 53 new cases per day this week compared with several hundred a day between late February and early March.
A British minister draws backlash for urging no ‘overuse’ of protective gear.
The British health secretary, Matt Hancock, has sparked anger among workers in the country’s National Health Service after he urged them not to waste personal protective equipment.
The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, warned on Saturday that supplies of personal protective equipment, or P.P.E., were dangerously low in London and part of northern England, and said that doctors were putting their lives at risk to treat patients with the coronavirus.
“It’s really important that people don’t overuse P.P.E.,” Mr. Hancock said in a BBC radio interview on Saturday. “It’s a precious resource.”
At a daily briefing on Friday, he said that masks and aprons did not have to be changed after treating each patient.
But the Royal College of Nursing’s general secretary, Donna Kinnair, told BBC’s “Breakfast” show: “I take offense, actually, that we are saying that health care workers are abusing or overusing P.P.E. I think what we know is, we don’t have enough supply.”
The opposition Labour Party leader, Keir Starmer, also said on Twitter: “It is quite frankly insulting to imply frontline staff are wasting PPE. There are horrific stories of NHS staff and care workers not having the equipment they need to keep them safe.”
Mr. Hancock also said on Saturday that 19 health service workers had died so far in the outbreak. Britain reported a daily total of 917 deaths in hospitals on Saturday, after a high of 980 on Friday. The total death toll stood at 9,975 as of Saturday.
He said the outbreak had yet to peak, although there were signs of hospital admissions “starting to flatten.”
With temperatures expected to reach up to 75 degrees Fahrenheit this weekend, government officials have warned the British public to continue to abide by lockdown restrictions.
The condition of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, has continued to improve, his office said in a statement on Friday, adding that he had “been able to do short walks, between periods of rest.” He left intensive care on Thursday after three nights but remains in a hospital.
After giving a rare televised address to the nation on Sunday, Queen Elizabeth II again delivered a message to Britons. She encouraged people to continue practicing social distancing and said that “Easter isn’t canceled.”
“We know that coronavirus will not overcome us,” she said. “As dark as death can be, particularly for those suffering with grief, light and life are greater.”
The pandemic is bringing old internet dreams to life.
It’s been decades since utopian thinkers dreamed that cyberspace would miraculously fix societal woes. Yet the pandemic has prompted some to realize that social media — where we normally just promote ourselves — can be mobilized for building a sense of community.
In the United States, artists are singing opera, reading poetry and doing standup comedy on You-Tube and Instagram. These days, our reporter writes in The New York Times Magazine, online performances feel “as though they were really less about pure entertainment and more about serving a nation, a world even, that was suffering in isolation and fear.”
Healing practitioners have also made meditation sessions, yoga classes and other mental-health assistance available free online. And GoFundMe is a vehicle for distributing money to people hit hardest by the crisis, including sex workers and underinsured artists.

WASHINGTON — As lawmakers gathered in the well of the House in the early hours of March 14 to vote on a sweeping coronavirus relief bill, Representative Max Rose, Democrat of New York, felt that the pandemic that had already begun spreading through the ranks of Congress was about to upend life as he knew it.
Hundreds of miles away in New York, his wife Leigh Rose, unaware that votes had finished just before 1 a.m., was frantically calling him, and then his roommate, Representative Jared Golden, Democrat of Maine, to let him know that his life was about to change in a much different way.
“Buddy!” Mr. Rose recalled Mr. Golden saying when he finally tracked Mr. Rose down. “You’re having a kid.”
The baby the Roses had long planned to adopt was about to be born, three weeks early. Now, the pair is navigating the first months of parenthood in the middle of a pandemic, figuring out how to secure formula and diapers in a shuttered city — all while Mr. Rose juggles trips back and forth from Washington to vote. In the middle of it all, the first-term congressman from Staten Island deployed for two weeks with the National Guard to assist with coronavirus relief.
“Think about this world that he’s been brought into, startlingly different than the world was just several months before,” Mr. Rose said of his newborn son. “We just really want him to be safe, and happy, and healthy. It’s scary.”
“But what a story of his birth,” he added.The prospect of parenthood had been simmering beneath the tumultuous events of Mr. Rose’s freshman term: a month after he took office during the nation’s longest government shutdown, the couple began pursuing the adoption process. The months of arduous paperwork and uncertainty continued through Mr. Rose’s adjustment to a weekly commute between Staten Island and Washington, and a summer of congressional investigations.
In November, as the impeachment inquiry consumed Capitol Hill, the couple learned they had been matched with a birth mother, whom they declined to identify out of respect for her privacy, and began preparing to welcome their baby in April. But in the wee hours of a Saturday morning in March, as Mr. Rose voted on coronavirus relief legislation, Ms. Rose learned that their son was about to be born right then. She jumped in her car and drove through the night to reach New England.
Miles Benjamin Rose was born at 2 a.m., and Mr. Rose got the first flight out of Washington later that day to meet his son.
“There’s so many families that are going through exactly what we’re going through — I mean with newborns with young children at home,” Ms. Rose said. “We’re definitely not alone.”
As the couple drove back to New York with their son, the city had begun to completely shutter to stem the spread of the virus. They agreed that Mr. Rose, an Afghanistan combat veteran who is a captain in the Army National Guard, should deploy to help with the city’s response to the pandemic. He was the first member of Congress to do so, citing a desire to take a more personal role in providing relief to his constituents.
It was a decision that kept Mr. Rose physically apart from Ms. Rose and Miles for a month, during the deployment and then the mandated two-week isolation period to ensure that Mr. Rose had not contracted the coronavirus.
“It was the right thing to do,” Mr. Rose said. “It was important to serve in this capacity at this moment.”
“Everybody is sacrificing far more than we have,” he added, pointing to the doctors and nurses he met who were isolating in basements or hotels for far longer periods of time to protect their families and maintain their work.
Ms. Rose acknowledged the challenge of the circumstances, but added: “There’s so many people that are struggling, and it’s so important for Max to take care of the people in our district.”
In the moments when Mr. Rose could come home during his deployment, he would eat dinner on the trunk of their car in the garage — 10 feet away from where Ms. Rose would stand with the baby. But then Mr. Rose had to isolate himself for another two weeks, keeping him from holding Miles, who is just starting to coo and smile, until Friday.
The pair has also tapped into the growing network of parents on Capitol Hill with young children. They ticked off a list of Mr. Rose’s Democratic colleagues — Representatives Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, Pete Aguilar of California, Josh Gottheimer, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Antonio Delgado of New York among them — and their spouses, who have repeatedly checked in on the couple in recent days.
“I lean on them — they understand the experiences that we have,” said Ms. Rose, who recently joined a Zoom call with a dozen congressional spouses to check in.
It remains unclear, they said, how the couple will handle Mr. Rose’s trips to Washington, where coronavirus cases continue to escalate. The House is expected to return the week of May 11. Mr. Rose said having a newborn at home had only intensified his desire to institute a remote voting policy in times of emergency, to ease the burden on congressional families.
And the work on Capitol Hill and its consequences, he said, have become even more personal for him now that he is a father.
“We’re going to continue to find joy in our family, and the little moments each and every day,” Mr. Rose said. “And that joy and that optimism and that hope is even more important right now, because when we say that we’re all in this together, it’s our family with everyone else’s.”"

MONTREAL — Thirty-one people were found dead in less than a month at a nursing home in Montreal, at least five confirmed to have coronavirus — a powerful Canadian emblem of how nursing homes are among the places hardest hit by the pandemic.
In the United States 17 bodies were recently discovered at a long-term care facility in New Jersey, among 68 deaths linked to the residence, 26 confirmed as coronavirus cases. And it was at a long-term care facility in Kirkland, in Washington state, that Americans first got a glimpse of the horrors to come after residents fell ill with Covid-19 in late February.
The phenomenon has been seen across Europe as well. In Spain, soldiers sent to disinfect nursing homes found people abandoned, or even dead, in their beds. Italy, Britain and France have acknowledged that their official statistics have overlooked many virus-related deaths in long-term care facilities.
The deaths in Canada were discovered late last week at Résidence Herron, a private home for seniors in Montreal, after the local health authority, alarmed by staff shortages and the spread of coronavirus at the home, took control of the residence.
They found dehydrated residents lying listless in bed, unfed for days, with excrement seeping out of their diapers.
“I’d never seen anything like it in my 32-year nursing career,” said Loredana Mule, a nurse on the team. “It was horrific — there wasn’t enough food to feed people, the stench could’ve killed a horse.”
After she left the home, she said, she collapsed in her car and wept.A skeleton staff of two nurses had been left to care for a private residence with nearly 150 beds, she said. The remaining staff had fled amid the outbreak of the coronavirus, leaving patients, some paralyzed or with other chronic illnesses, to fend for themselves.
In announcing the deaths on Saturday, François Legault, the premier of Quebec, said there appeared to be “gross negligence.”
The Montreal police, Quebec’s health ministry and the provincial coroner’s office have begun investigations into the home. Officers from Montreal police’s major crime unit have been sifting through evidence, confiscating files and interviewing employees.
Autopsies of the dead are also expected, though families of relatives said they feared they may never learn the truth about how many residents had died of the virus since many of the bodies had been cremated.
“How is it possible that so many body bags left that place and no one raised the alarm?” Ms. Mule asked.
After discovering the deaths at the Herron, Quebec’s ministry of health this week inspected 40 private homes for the elderly, and Mr. Legault called for volunteers to fill staffing gaps at residences. On Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Quebec officials had asked the federal government for staffing help for its overwhelmed nursing homes.
Quebec is the Canadian province most severely affected by coronavirus, with 15,857 cases and 630 people dead. Health officials say retirement homes accounted for roughly half of the total deaths in Quebec.
Mr. Legault has blamed Herron’s management for the catastrophe, saying that after the residence was informed last month that a patient had tested positive for the virus, it refused to cooperate with the regional health authority, forcing it to obtain a court order and delaying intervention.
By the time a team of health care workers arrived on March 29, the coronavirus had already invaded.Résidence Herron is owned by a Quebec real estate company, Katasa, which owns six other retirement residences. A spokesman for the company declined to comment on allegations of negligence.
But Katherine Chowieri, whose father, Samir Chowieri, is president of Katasa and who is a manager at the company, denied negligence to local news outlets, telling them that she blamed the health authority for not heeding the residence’s calls for help as staff left amid a shortage of protective equipment.
On Tuesday, Patrizia Di Biase-Leone learned that her mother, Antonietta Pollice, who turned 97 on March 11 and suffers from dementia, had tested positive for the virus. She said the residence had obfuscated her mother’s condition, even as she suffered symptoms including diarrhea, dehydration and hallucinations.
“Of course, we are gravely concerned about our mom,” she said. “She is emaciated and losing the will to live. We are getting no cooperation. What do we do? Call the cops?”
The glossy website of Résidence Herron touts a nutritionist for personalized meal plans, a bistro cafe, a hairdresser and a full-time nursing staff for its elderly patients.
But families of residents said in interviews that, over several years, they had seen their relatives deprived of basic needs like diapers, exercise, proper hygiene and healthy meals, despite a monthly cost of between 3,000 and 10,000 Canadian dollars to stay there.
When the coronavirus spread to the residence, they said, they desperately struggled to get information about their loved ones, while their pleas to test their relatives for the virus were ignored.
This is not the first time the Herron’s services have come under scrutiny. Last year, a report by Quebec Health and Social Services warned that the home’s palliative care was lacking.
In 1981, Mr. Chowieri, the owner of Résidence Herron, was convicted of drug trafficking, serving about 15 months in prison. One year later he was convicted of fraud. In 1994, a seniors residence he owned was the subject of a money-laundering inquiry by the national police. And in 2002, he was fined $125,000 for tax evasion.
Frédéric Lepage, a spokesman for the company, said Samir Chowieri’s criminal record was expunged in 2014 due to good behavior.
Leane Conti, whose mother, Carole Stewart, 79, is partially paralyzed and was bedridden at Residence Herron for two years, said staff repeatedly refused to lift her mother off her bed to properly bathe her, leading to infections in her legs and feet.
She said she was chided by the residence that her mother was “urinating too much and using too many diapers.”
After her mother came down with a fever in late March and was sent to a nearby hospital, Ms. Conti said she finally learned from the hospital that there was a case of coronavirus at the residence.
Ms. Stewart was sent back to the Herron, where Ms. Conti said she wasn’t quarantined, pending test results. She has since tested positive and has been hospitalized.
“When I learned there were 31 bodies in less than a month at the Herron, I was shocked but not surprised,” she said."
42,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/business/coronavirus-china-vaccine.html,The New York Times,2020-05-04,['Sui-Lee Wee'],China’s Coronavirus Vaccine Drive Empowers a Troubled Industry,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/01/business/00virus-china-vaccine-1/00virus-china-vaccine-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
China wants to beat the world in the race to find a coronavirus vaccine — and, by some measures, it is doing just that.
Desperate to protect its people and to deflect growing international criticism of how it handled the outbreak, it has slashed red tape and offered resources to drug companies. Four Chinese companies have started testing their vaccine candidates on humans, more than the United States and Britain combined.
But China’s leaders have empowered a vaccine industry that has long been mired in quality problems and scandals. Just two years ago, Chinese parents erupted in fury after they discovered ineffective vaccines had been given mostly to babies.
Finding a vaccine isn’t enough. China’s companies must also win over the trust of the public, who might be more inclined to choose a foreign-made vaccine over a Chinese one.
“The Chinese now do not have confidence in the vaccines produced in China,” said Ray Yip, the former head of the Gates Foundation in China. “That’s probably going to be the biggest headache. If they didn’t have all those incidents, people will probably line up by the miles to get it.”
The need is urgent. More than 247,000 people have died globally, by official figures as of Monday, and the true count is probably much higher. The coronavirus remains stubbornly difficult to stamp out — even China, which officially appears to have tamed the spread, has suffered from sporadic outbreaks.
China also wants to deflect accusations that its silencing of early warnings contributed to the global pandemic. Developing a vaccine for the world would, in addition, burnish its standing as a global scientific and medical power.
So China has made its vaccine a national priority, though it hasn’t disclosed spending details. One senior official said a vaccine for emergency use could be ready by September. State media has made a celebrity out of Chen Wei, the Chinese military’s top virologist, who is leading one of the vaccine efforts. The public is responding.
Huang Shiyue, an 18-year-old first-year medical student in Wuhan, left her apartment on a recent early Sunday morning for the first time in three months to take a taxi to a wellness center an hour away. There, she offered up her arm in the name of science.
But in an illustration of how difficult it will be to find a safe and effective treatment, Ms. Huang grew dizzy and sick.
“If I can help and benefit people with one little move,” she said, “then I think this is a very worthwhile thing.”
China’s vaccine drive has put Beijing’s considerable strengths and glaring weaknesses on display. With its firm hand on the levers of Chinese industry, Beijing can corral companies and scientists to reach national goals.
At the same time, China’s vaccine companies have been accustomed to a closed political system that has a history of covering up safety scandals and protects them from foreign competition. Few invest heavily in research and development, and they have not discovered many products with global impact.
Instead, many invest more in selling and distribution, a large chunk of which includes managing relationships with local disease control centers. Experts say that creates incentives for corruption.
China’s regulators also tend to look the other way when it comes to state-owned firms, which make up about 40 percent of the vaccine industry. Many vaccine makers operate with an expectation of impunity, knowing that even if they are found to have produced faulty products, they are unlikely to be shut down.
The vaccine that Ms. Huang received is being developed by CanSino Biologics, a Tianjin-based pharmaceutical firm, and the medical science arm of the People’s Liberation Army. The CanSino vaccine was the first to enter Phase 2 trials, which in the hierarchy of drug testing means it is further along than the world’s other candidates, though there is no guarantee that it will be proven effective. (It has been tested so far on 508 people; a candidate from Oxford University in Phase 1 trials, or earlier-stage testing, has been administered to twice as many people.)
One other Chinese institution also has a candidate in Phase 2 testing — the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, an arm of state-run Sinopharm Group. Sinovac Biotech, a private company and the Beijing Institute of Biological Products, which also belongs to Sinopharm, have potential vaccines in Phase 1 trials.
The Wuhan institute was involved in a 2018 scandal in which defective vaccines for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and other conditions were injected into hundreds of thousands of babies. China imposed a $1.3 billion fine on another virus maker involved, Changchun Changsheng. The scandal led to the firing of dozens of officials and pledges of a swift industry cleanup.
The government confiscated the Wuhan institute’s “illegal income,” fined the company and punished nine executives.
The Wuhan institute has been sued at least twice in China by plaintiffs who have alleged that the institute’s vaccines have caused “abnormal reactions,” according to court documents. In both cases, the court ruled that the Wuhan institute had to partially compensate the victims a total of roughly $71,500. Its executives have been accused at least three times of bribing officials at local centers for disease and control in various provinces to thank them for purchasing their vaccines. The executives were convicted but no criminal charges were pursued against the company.
Sinovac Biotech had also been involved in a bribery scandal, according to court documents. From 2002 to 2014, a court in Beijing said, the general manager of Sinovac Biotech gave China’s deputy director in charge of drug evaluations nearly $50,000 to help the firm with drug approvals. Sinovac was not charged. The general manager was a man surnamed Yin, the documents showed. Chinese media reports have said that person is the current chief executive, Yin Weidong, who held the title of general manager from 2001 to 2017.
Sinovac, the Wuhan institute, and its parent, China National Biotec Group, did not respond to requests for comment.
Despite the companies’ earlier stumbles, the Chinese government has given them permission to accelerate trials. Regulators in the United States and other places have done the same for other companies. The Wuhan institute, Sinovac and the Beijing institute got combined approvals to run the first two phases, a decision questioned by several Chinese scientists, who felt that safety results from the first phase should be evaluated before the second phase was begun.
Ding Sheng, the dean of the pharmacy school at Tsinghua University in Beijing, said that some companies were “adopting unconventional methods” in the preclinical research stage, running tasks like the design process and animal modeling at the same time when they should be done consecutively, according to the People’s Daily, the Communist Party’s official newspaper.
“I understand the people’s eager anticipation of a vaccine,” Dr. Ding was quoted as saying. “But from a scientific point of view, no matter how anxious we are, we cannot lower our standards.” He did not respond to a request for comment.
Dr. Chen’s academy issued calls on the internet for phase one volunteers. Ms. Huang successfully registered for the second round on April 10. The next day, she got a call and text message: Please come tomorrow.
“Of course, I was worried at the beginning,” she said. “To say you’re not at all worried is impossible, right?” She surfed the internet and called her teacher, who listed pros and cons. She sought advice from her parents.
Then she went. Workers ran an antibody test, to make sure she was not already immune to the coronavirus, an H.I.V. test and a pregnancy test.
The participants were divided into low- and medium-dose groups and another placebo group, as part of a “double-blind” experiment. They were not told their group.
Fifteen minutes after Ms. Huang got her shot, she started to feel dizzy. Her stomach hurt. Her heart began beating fast. She got diarrhea.
Dr. Chen and other doctors checked her. Someone offered her hot water. She took a walk in the sun. Finally, they took her in an ambulance to a subway station, where she took a taxi home.
Ms. Huang said she feels fine at home.Shi Zibo, a junior in college, also signed up to be a volunteer and got the shot on April 12. On the fourth day, he got a slight fever but said he has no other side effects.
“I felt very proud when I received the call,” Mr. Shi said. “There are not many opportunities for me in to contribute to other people in this life, so I will not regret it, regardless of the final result.”Amber Wang and Liu Yi contributed research in Beijing."

If your income has fallen or been cut off completely, we’re here to help. This guide will connect you to the basic information you’ll need to get through this, including on government benefits, free services and financial strategies. This guide has been updated with the details of the $2 trillion relief plan that has been enacted by Washington.
If you have a question that we have not answered about various forms of relief — or something you can offer that large numbers of people can access — please write to hubforhelp@nytimes.com. Ron and Tara will read every message.
Stimulus ChecksThe giant economic stimulus package will enable the federal government to begin making the payments, though the amount you receive will depend on your income.
Single adults who have an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or less will get the full $1,200, while married couples with no children and earning $150,000 or less will receive a total of $2,400. For every qualifying child age 16 or under, you get another $500.
People who earn more will see their payments decrease until they phase out completely. That happens for single people earning $99,000 or married people who have no children and earn $198,000. There are other situations that make certain people ineligible — college-age children who were claimed as dependents on their parents’ returns won’t receive a check, for example. And you generally need a valid Social Security number to collect as well.
Many people don’t have to do anything to receive the payment. If the Internal Revenue Service already has your bank account information from your 2018 or 2019 tax returns, it will transfer the money to you via direct deposit based on the recent income-tax figures it already has.
Payments started landing in mid-April, but it could take a few months more for some people to get them, despite the government’s removal of some hurdles. You can find out more about checking on the whereabouts of your payment here.
Unemployment InsuranceThe new relief package made significant, albeit temporary, changes to the way the unemployment insurance system works and increases benefit amounts until July 31.
Under the plan, these state programs now cover far more people than are usually eligible, including self-employed people and part-time workers.
The plan also makes exceptions for people who cannot work for a variety of coronavirus-related reasons — and you don’t necessarily need to lose your job to qualify. If you’re quarantined or have been furloughed — if you’re not being paid but expect to return to your job eventually — you may be able to get unemployment insurance.
States set many of their own rules, including for benefit amounts, which are generally calculated as a percentage of your income over the past year, up to a certain maximum. Some states are more generous than others, but unemployment typically replaces roughly 45 percent of your lost income.
Most states pay benefits for 26 weeks, though some states have trimmed that back. (This primer provides more information about how the program usually works when the country isn’t struggling to contain a pandemic; eligibility rules have changed since this was last posted.)
The new law temporarily increases the amount of benefits by $600 weekly. It also extends by up to 13 weeks the time period for which state-level benefits are available for many workers. Here’s a helpful illustration that breaks down how the program works in New York state.
Paid Sick Leave and Family LeaveThe coronavirus emergency relief package gives many American workers paid leave if they need to take time off because of the outbreak, but there are lots of exceptions.
Most workers at small and midsize companies, as well as government employees, can get two weeks of paid sick leave if they are ill or seeking care, as long as they’ve been employed at least 30 days. They can receive their full pay, up to $511 a day.
Some workers can also get 12 weeks of paid leave to care for children whose schools are closed, or whose child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak, but fewer workers qualify for this type of leave. They can receive two-thirds of their usual pay, up to $200 a day.
Part-time workers will be paid the amount they typically earn in a two-week period, up to the daily limits. People who are self-employed — including gig workers like Uber drivers and Instacart shoppers — can also receive paid leave, but they must calculate their average daily income and claim it as a tax credit.
There are gaps, though. Employers with fewer than 50 workers can deny workers the child-care leave (but not the sick leave) if it would be hard on their businesses, and companies with more than 500 employees are excluded from the rules entirely. Many workers at big businesses already have paid sick leave, but their low-wage workers are the least likely to be covered. The New America Foundation has published a detailed list of large employers (mostly consumer-facing companies like retailers, restaurant chains and hotels) and their policies.
And these changes aren’t permanent — the leave law expires Dec. 31.You can find out more from the Department of Labor, which has posted a fact sheet for workers and a Q&A.
Federal Student LoansIf you have a federal student loan, you should automatically receive some relief without lifting a finger: Borrowers will be placed in so-called administrative forbearance, which allows you to temporarily stop making payments from March 13 until Sept. 30.
No interest will accrue during the administrative forbearance period. (Usually interest continues to pile up when borrowers pause their payments because of a hardship.) Interest you accrued before the period began will also not be rolled into your loan principal,  according to a Department of Education spokeswoman.
Borrowers who want to continue making loan payments can do so — and you may end up paying the balance down faster if the full amount of your payment can be applied to your loan’s principal.
The Education Department says loan payments that are skipped under the administrative forbearance will still count toward loan forgiveness for borrowers in income-driven repayment and public service loan forgiveness programs, as long as the other usual requirements are fulfilled. Your loan servicer will have more details.
But keep in mind that for now, this relief applies only to federal student loans owned by the Education Department, such as direct loans (including those in default). Loans issued through state agencies and others, including big private lenders like Sallie Mae, are not covered. Other loans not covered include the majority of Federal Family Education Loans, which are mostly held by commercial lenders, and school-held Perkins loans.
Some private lenders are offering relief programs. Sallie Mae said it was offering suspension of payment for up to three months, with no damage to a borrower’s credit. Another, Navient, made an identical offer for “qualified” borrowers; a spokesman said you just need to contact the company and explain how your financial situation had changed. A third big private lender, Wells Fargo, says it will offer help, but a spokesman said the bank would not commit to a set number of months or any other specifics.
If you have more questions, check out the Education Department’s Q&A here. It addresses what to do if you have auto-debit payments (they’re suspended during this period), are trying to rehabilitate a defaulted loan, and more.
To see if your loans are eligible for this temporary pause, try contacting your loan servicer — the company where you send monthly payments — online or by phone. If you do not know who your servicer is or how to contact it, go to StudentAid.gov/login or call 1-800-4-FED-AID (1-800-433-3243; T.T.Y. for the deaf or hearing-impaired 1-800-730-8913) for more help.
Mortgages and RentMillions of homeowners have already pressed the pause button on their mortgage payments, now that their financial lives have been upended by the pandemic.
Under the CARES Act, homeowners with mortgages backed by the federal government are permitted to temporarily suspend their payments, a move called a forbearance, for up to a year. This covers about 70 percent of mortgage holders and includes loans backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (known as F.H.A. loans), and those guaranteed by the Department of Veterans and the Department of Agriculture.
After the forbearance period is over, however, the skipped payments must be paid back. And how that is done will vary depending on your personal circumstances — and who owns your loan. About 30 percent of mortgage holders have loans owned by banks or private borrowers, and their options aren’t always clear.
If you have a federally backed loan, you should be presented with several different ways to become current on your mortgage — and none of them require you to immediately pay the money back in a lump sum (but you can if you want to). If you can afford to resume your regular payments, you might pay the money back over several months, for example, or settle up when the home is sold, refinanced or when the mortgage term is up.
People who cannot afford to make their mortgage payments after the forbearance period expires will probably have to modify their loan (to lower the monthly amount), a more formal process that will require an application. 
To find out which entity may control your mortgage, you can search your address on various government websites. And if you don’t feel like you are being treated fairly — or are simply overwhelmed by the process — it might help to find a housing counselor. For more information, check out our short resource guide here.
Federal housing officials have also announced a nationwide eviction and foreclosure moratorium for borrowers with loans backed by Fannie, Freddie and the F.H.A. This includes foreclosures that are already in progress.
A coalition of mortgage industry groups representing banks, finance companies and others has said it will also grant payment suspensions of at least three months — and up to 12 months — to homeowners whose loans are not owned by Fannie or Freddie, but they have said their effort requires a federal backstop.
If you rent, the best national resource we’ve found so far is the search-by-state function on Justshelter.org. This offers information on local organizations that can provide advice to renters in distress. Just Shelter’s founders are Matthew Desmond, the author of the book “Evicted,” and Tessa Lowinske Desmond. Mr. Desmond is also the founder of Eviction Lab; it is publishing a list of local and regional actions to pause evictions of renters.
The emergency stimulus bill put a temporary, nationwide eviction moratorium in place for any renters whose landlords have mortgages backed or owned by Fannie, Freddie or the F.H.A. This will last through the end of July, and landlords can’t charge any fees or penalties for nonpayment of rent either. The moratorium applies only to eviction for nonpayment; tenants can still be evicted for other reasons.
Regulators have also told landlords whose own mortgages are owned by Fannie or Freddie that they too can use forbearance, just as long as they do not evict tenants after they pause their mortgage payments. The challenge for renters is figuring out whether their landlord has such a mortgage. This information sometimes appears if you look up the address in the National Housing Preservation Database.
If the landlord’s mortgage is not in forbearance, renters who skip payments could be risking eviction if there has not been a local prohibition. (New York, for example, has suspended eviction actions until further notice.)
Utility BillsSome utility providers are offering to stop cutting people off for nonpayment.A number of large internet companies have agreed not to terminate residential or small business customers who can’t pay their bills: AT&T, Comcast, Cox, RCN, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon. A full list of companies is available on the Federal Communications Commission site.
It is not yet clear whether companies want customers to call to invoke this relief and provide proof or whether they will offer it automatically to everyone. People who need help should call and ask.
A number of water service providers have either suspended shut-offs for nonpayment or don’t shut service off for late payments generally, according to a ProPublica roundup. They include Atlanta; Birmingham, Ala.; Long Beach, Calif.; Los Angeles; Newark; New York City and St. Louis.
In Washington state, the main Seattle area utilities are suspending cutoffs as well. In addition, the provider of electric and water service in Seattle is allowing people to self-certify their recent income reductions in order to qualify for at least half off their bills.
In California, Pacific Gas and Electric has, until further notice, stopped shutting off its services to consumers and businesses who have not paid.
In New York, Con Edison also has temporarily suspended any electric and gas service shut-offs.If utilities in other areas follow suit, they are likely to publish alerts somewhere on the top of their websites or in the news release section of their pages.
More Helpful AdviceYou have three extra months to file your federal income taxes. The federal government has moved the tax filing deadline to July 15. You don’t have to file your return or make payments until then. If you are owed a refund, you’ll still receive it as normal when you file your tax return, no matter when you submit it.

44,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/nyregion/rent-strike-coronavirus.html,The New York Times,2020-05-01,"['Matthew Haag', 'Conor Dougherty']",#CancelRent Is New Rallying Cry for Tenants. Landlords Are Alarmed.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/01/nyregion/01nyvirus-rent/01nyvirus-rent-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
As unemployment soars across the country, tenants rights groups and community nonprofits have rallied around an audacious goal: to persuade the government to halt rent and mortgage payments — without back payments accruing — for as long as the economy is battered by the coronavirus.
The effort has been brewing on social media, with the hashtag #CancelRent and online video rallies, as well as a smattering of in-person protests, frequently held in cars to maintain social distancing.
Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, offered a fervent endorsement of the campaign, encouraging her progressive base to embrace a movement to upend the housing market.
“It’s not that it’s impossible to do and it’s not that we can’t do it,” Ms. Ocasio-Cortez said in a live video on her Facebook page on Monday. “We lack enough politicians with political will to actually help people who are tenants and actually help people who are mom-and-pop landlords.”
But in New York and other cities, landlords say they too are struggling to pay their bills since many tenants have already been unable to pay rent. They call the advocates’ efforts reckless and say that withholding rent would create cascading consequences, including leaving property owners without the means to pay mortgages and property taxes or to maintain buildings.
Still, from New York to Kansas City to Los Angeles, groups are encouraging tenants to withhold payments on Friday, the due date for May rent, aiming to create pressure for an expansion of affordable housing and tenant-friendly legislation.
To cancel rent and mortgage payments, the federal government would have to take sweeping and possibly unconstitutional intervention in the housing and financial markets, interceding in private contracts and ordering banks and landlords not to collect money.
While the prospect of this happening is low,  the campaigns are less about pushing a particular piece of legislation and more about kindling a mass movement akin to the Occupy Wall Street protests that followed the 2008 financial crisis.
“Rent is not being paid, and the organizing strategy is figuring out how we rally around that and politicize it for our benefit,” said Tara Raghuveer, director of the Homes Guarantee campaign of People’s Action, a national network of local advocacy organizations.
Groups from California to New York have amassed a sizable following of renters who say they will skip May rent. They have also received a boost from progressive members of Congress,  who introduced a cancel rent bill.
“It’s a moment that people are literally rising up for real transformation in the housing market,” said Cea Weaver, the campaign coordinator at Housing Justice for All, a New York group.
Though nascent, the movement has alarmed landlords, especially smaller property owners who say that they, like many of their tenants, also survive month to month.
“When government officials say, ‘Cancel rent,’” said Jay Martin, the executive director of Community Housing Improvement Program, which represents 4,000 New York City landlords, “they are essentially saying that we are canceling the ability for you to pay the bills we are putting on you.”
Mr. Martin said that if tenants’ rights organizers wanted to target a main driver of high housing costs, they should encourage elected officials to cut property taxes. A recent report by the New York City’s Rent Guidelines Board said that about 30 percent of a landlord’s expenses for rent-regulated apartments go toward property taxes.
New York, which has more housing units than any place in the United States, is a city of renters: There are nearly 2.2 million rental units in the city. Mr. Martin said that no landlord he knows would want to evict a tenant in this economy.
“Landlords are being made the scapegoat for all the problems,” he said.Joseph Strasburg, the president of the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents 25,000 landlords in New York City, warned that a rent strike would “create an economic and housing pandemic.”
“The city and its residential housing landscape will crumble into an economic abyss worse than the 1970s, when New York was the national poster child for urban blight,” Mr. Strasburg said. 
As bad as the economy is, rental payments in April were better than many landlords expected.As businesses laid off employees, property owners reported a steep drop in rent collections, with close to a third of tenants behind as of the first week of April, according to a survey by the National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade group for big apartment owners.
But by month’s end, after stimulus payments and unemployment checks started flowing, the nationwide nonpayment rate was only three percentage points below where it was a year ago.
Still, those numbers probably understate the stress, as various surveys show that landlords have deferred rent, offered concessions or used security deposits to cover missed payments. And tenants have increasingly used credit cards to cover their bills.
Vincia Barber, 39, who lost her nanny job for a family in New York City that decided to move to California during the pandemic, said that she has decided to join the rent strike.
She pays $1,877 for a rent-stabilized apartment in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, that she shares with her 14-year-old daughter. There is mold growing on the bathroom walls, and they cannot open windows because of the stench of garbage behind the building, she said.
“Something needs to change,” Ms. Barber said. “If it’s not now during the Covid-19 epidemic, then I don’t know what it’s going to take for the governor and mayor to do something.”
Rent strike or not, tens of millions of people will be under severe rent stress in May. Looking to rally people digitally, on Thursday, the Action Center on Race & the Economy, which acts as a campaign hub for advocacy organizations, unveiled WeStrikeTogether.org, a website that will accumulate the various May rent strikes into a nationwide heat map.
People who sign up will be directed to a list of resources and be routed to local housing organizations to try and build more support for the #CancelRent campaign.
“The traditional definition of a rent strike is someone who is choosing not to pay for whatever reason, and we’re defining it more broadly here to help people see that it’s a political choice not to help folks who can’t pay rent,” said Maurice BP-Weeks, co-executive director of the action center.
It’s not as if tenants have lacked support: The $2 trillion CARES Act distributed expanded unemployment insurance and the stimulus payments, along with aid to public-housing providers and grants that states can use for rental assistance.
Still, tenant organizers and landlords are pushing for direct housing assistance.Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, introduced the Rent and Mortgage Cancellation Act, which would relieve tenants of their obligation to pay rent, transfer mortgages to the federal government and allow landlords to recoup their rent costs — but only if they agree to a vast new regulatory program that includes a rent freeze and the inability to collect back payments."

This briefing is no longer updating. Read the latest developments in the coronavirus outbreak here.
California and Texas received the most small-business relief funds.
Money from the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program, which ran out of funds on Thursday, flowed heavily to California and Texas, with construction companies and manufacturers getting the largest number of loans, rather than harder-hit retailers and restaurants, according to new data.
The nearly $350 billion in the Paycheck Protection Program also disproportionately flowed to states that have suffered fewer infections and deaths under the virus, like Kansas, than to harder-hit states like New York and New Jersey, when adjusting for the size of the small-business economy in each state.
The new data, which include loan approvals through Thursday, show accommodation and food service firms have received less than 9 percent of the money from the program, about $30.5 billion, though they have suffered the largest job losses of any industry during this recession. Construction firms received the largest share, at just over 13 percent, or about $45 billion.
Adjusting for the total amount of money that small businesses pay their employees and would be eligible to receive in loans to cover payroll, the Great Plains states emerge as big winners, with Nebraska, Kansas and the Dakotas receiving disproportionate shares of the money. By that metric, Nebraska did twice as well as New York.
The S.B.A. program was intended for banks to distribute the loans, which the federal government will pay off in most cases. That structure benefited companies with existing relationships with banks.
S.B.A. officials included data on the largest lending institutions in the program, though they were not identified. The top lender distributed more than $14 million in loans with an average size of more than $500,000 per loan — suggesting that the institution was giving loans to relatively large businesses.
Stocks jump as investors rally behind the idea of reopening the economy.
Stocks in the United States rallied on Friday, with efforts to reopen the economy taking center stage and investors undeterred by more data showing the economic damage of the coronavirus pandemic.
The gains came after President Trump told governors on Thursday that they could begin reopening businesses in their states by May 1 or earlier, and Boeing — one of the nation’s largest manufacturers — said it planned to bring about 27,000 employees back to work in Washington State to resume aircraft production.
The announcement is the first attempt at large-scale resumption of business activity by a U.S. corporation since the coronavirus outbreak forced companies and government officials to shut down most nonessential work. Boeing’s shares rose more than 14 percent on Friday.
Some European automakers — including Volkswagen, Volvo and Daimler — are planning to restart assembly lines next week, staffed by workers in masks and protective clothing, sometimes separated from one another by plastic screens.
Opel, a unit of the French automaker PSA, said it would reopen its German dealerships on Monday after the German government announced that it would gradually ease lockdown restrictions.
The S&P 500 rose 2.7 percent, while Boeing’s gains led the Dow Jones industrial average to a 3 percent jump.
After global stock markets nose-dived earlier this year, they have been rebounding since late March, as investors have routinely looked past evidence of the damage caused by stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns, and instead focused on hopes for an eventual recovery. The gains on Friday mean stocks ended the week higher, despite reports showing a historic plunge in retail sales and a continued surge in unemployment claims.
The S&P 500 is now up more than 28 percent from its lowest point this year, which was reached on March 23. It is still nearly 18 percent below its high in late February.
On Friday, the rally came after China reported that its economy — the world’s second-largest after that of the United States — shrank for the first time in decades. And data on car sales in Europe showed they collapsed.
Some also saw hopeful signs in a report by the medical news website STAT that a drug from Gilead Sciences showed early — and, thus far, unproven — promise in fighting the coronavirus. According to STAT, the antiviral drug, remdesivir, has helped patients with severe symptoms recover rapidly in a clinical trial at a Chicago hospital. Gilead’s shares jumped nearly 10 percent.
The Trump administration plans to funnel $19 billion to farmers.President Trump said Friday he would channel $19 billion to American farmers and ranchers that have been hurt by the fallout from coronavirus, payments that come on top of tens of billions of dollars of assistance given to farmers in the last year to offset the pain of the trade war with China.
The Trump administration will make $16 billion in direct payments to farmers who have experienced losses from coronavirus, Mr. Trump said in a briefing Friday evening. It would also purchase a further $3 billion of fresh produce, dairy and meat that will be distributed through food banks and other community and faith organizations to people in need, he added.
“These are great people, great Americans,” Mr. Trump said. “It is money well deserved. Not only were they targeted at one point by China, that was over a period of time, and they never complained.”
Over the past year, the Trump administration has extended $28 billion to American farmers and ranchers to help offset the pain of a trade war with China. Mr. Trump ratcheted up tariffs on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese products in an effort to reach a trade deal, prompting China to respond with tariffs on American soybeans, pork, dairy and other products that crippled sales to one of the world’s largest markets.
More news media outlets lay off workers.
The news media industry continues to be shellacked by the dismal advertising market as businesses remain shuttered throughout much of the country. The New York Times now estimates that approximately 33,000 workers in the media industry have been affected by planned layoffs, pay cuts and furloughs, up from 28,000 last week.
The magazine company Condé Nast announced on Monday that it was cutting the pay of nearly half its work force by 10 to 20 percent. The newspaper chain Advance Local — which shares a corporate parent with Condé — said this week that it would furlough employees for one to two weeks.
Digital sites, whose subscription businesses are often immature or nonexistent, continue to impose cost-savings as a way to stanch the bleeding in the ad market. Slate, which converted its membership program, Slate Plus, into a paywall last month, is cutting all employees’ pay on a sliding scale. Vox Media, which purchased New York Media last year, is furloughing roughly 10 percent of its work force and cutting the pay of high-earning employees.
The Los Angeles Times, one of the country’s largest newspapers by circulation, announced internally this week that it was furloughing 40 non-newsroom workers and cutting senior managers’ pay. It also shuttered three community weeklies, laying off 14 people, including guild members.
The ride-sharing business has collapsed.
In February, Uber said it had expected to bring in $16 billion to $17 billion in revenue this year. On Thursday, the company said it could no longer forecast what will happen.
Lyft has not yet made a similar announcement, but there’s no reason to think it faces a different fate.
Drawing from aggregated debit and credit card purchases of millions of U.S. consumers, for example, the analytics firm Second Measure found that spending on Uber’s rides dropped about 83 percent in March. And earnings tracker service Gridwise, using data collected from more than 30,000 drivers nationwide, found that the average hourly earnings of drivers dropped 36 percent from the beginning of March to the middle of the month. By the end of March, wages began to recover slightly, but were still down 24 percent.
So how are the companies dealing with the slump? For now, the strategy appears to be: Wait it out, and deliver food — as much of it as possible.
Uber’s money-losing food delivery service, Uber Eats, most likely surpassed Uber’s ride-hailing business in sales by mid-March and jumped about 27 percent for the month, according to Second Measure.
Although Lyft had no food delivery business before the pandemic, it created a temporary one to deliver meals and groceries for students and seniors. And on Wednesday, Lyft expanded the program to 11 major cities, including Atlanta, Houston, San Francisco and Seattle.
What to know about the proliferation of frauds around the coronavirus.
Frauds around the coronavirus include businesses selling intravenous vitamin C drips to “boost immunity” to the virus, websites offering masks that never arrive and even reports of fake drive-up testing sites, where impostors swabbed people’s cheeks in exchange for cash.
Here are some questions and answers about coronavirus-related fraud:How can I protect myself from coronavirus fraud?First, understand that there are currently no F.D.A.-approved vaccines or treatments for the coronavirus, said Noah Joshua Phillips, an F.T.C. commissioner. That will, hopefully, change — but you are unlikely to hear about it first via a shady robocall. The best thing to do if you get a suspicious call is to hang up, he said.
What if I am expecting a government stimulus payment?Most people don’t have to do anything to get their economic stimulus payments, which the government is issuing to help people facing money troubles because of the virus. Those payments will be deposited into your bank account automatically, the I.R.S. said.
“The I.R.S. isn’t going to call you asking to verify or provide your financial information” so you can get your payment faster, the head of the agency, Chuck Rettig, said in a statement this month.
I saw a social media report about virus-related fraud occurring door to door. Is this true?Agencies including the F.B.I. have issued public warnings about people selling fake virus test kits and “unapproved treatments” on “door-to-door visits.” The inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services also warned of “scammers” going door to door offering Covid-19 tests in exchange for personal details, like Medicare information.
European car sales plummeted in March.
New data on Friday gave the first concrete indication of how severely European carmakers were hit by coronavirus lockdowns, and it was every bit as bad as feared.
New car registrations in the European Union fell 55 percent last month compared with a year earlier, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association said, as dealers closed their doors and buyers were stuck in their homes. Owners registered 570,000 new cars during the month, down from 1.3 million in March 2019.
Sales all but evaporated in Italy, the European country that went into lockdown the earliest, falling 85 percent. Spain and France also suffered declines of around 70 percent.
Carmakers that depend on southern Europe for sales also suffered the most. Fiat Chrysler sales plummeted 77 percent. PSA, whose brands include Peugeot, Citroën and Opel, suffered a 68 percent plunge in sales.
German carmakers BMW, Daimler and Volkswagen fared marginally better, with declines of less than 50 percent.
Catch up: Here’s what else is happening.Boeing will resume operations on Monday in the Philadelphia area, where it produces military aircraft such as the H-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey. The work had been suspended for two weeks on April 3. On Thursday, Boeing said it planned to bring back 27,000 workers next week to facilities in Washington State to work on commercial aircraft production.Walmart said that it had hired 150,000 workers since March 19, and it pledged to hire 50,000 more. The retailer said it had received more than a million applications since its initial hiring announcement. The new workers will be hired on a temporary basis, it said, adding that many had been furloughed from other companies and were looking to bridge the gap until they returned to their original jobs.The organizers behind San Diego Comic Con, the annual pop culture celebration, announced on Friday that the event was canceled, the first time in its 50-year history. Fans who purchased badges can request a refund or transfer their badges to next year’s event.Ford Motor said it expected to report a $2 billion loss for the first quarter, on revenue of $34 billion. The announcement came in a regulatory filing ahead of a full quarterly report on April 28. The automaker said earlier this week that its first-quarter wholesale volume was down 21 percent from a year earlier, mainly because of the outbreak’s impact on production and demand. It said last month that it was suspending its dividend and any share buybacks.General Electric’s aviation leasing division said it was canceling 69 orders for Boeing’s troubled 737 Max jet, which has been grounded for over a year after two fatal crashes. Boeing received 150 Max order cancellations last month. In the first quarter, it took in four times as many order cancellations as new orders.Procter & Gamble, the consumer products giant, reported a big jump in sales for the quarter as consumers stocked up on paper towels, toilet paper and diapers. P&G reported that organic net sales rose five percent to $17.2 billion. The company said increased shipments in North America and some parts of Europe offset declines in some Asian markets.The coronavirus outbreak has brought China’s extraordinary, nearly half-century-long run of growth to an end. The country’s National Bureau of Statistics said on Friday that the economic output shrank 6.8 percent from January through March compared to the same period last year. It’s the first economic shrinkage acknowledged in official statistics since 1976, when the country was in the final days of the Cultural Revolution.Reporting was contributed by Daisuke Wakabayashi, Davey Alba, Gina Kolata, Jack Ewing, Abdi Latif Dahir, Simon Marks, Karen Weise, Julie Creswell, Marc Tracy, Elaine Yu, Kevin McKenna, Nelson D.

WASHINGTON — The captain had reached a breaking point.The aircraft carrier he commanded, the Theodore Roosevelt, was docked in Guam as the coronavirus raced unchecked through its narrow corridors. The warship’s doctors estimated that more than 50 crew members would die, but Capt. Brett E. Crozier’s superiors were balking at what they considered his drastic request to evacuate nearly the entire ship.
Captain Crozier was haunted by the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship of 2,600 passengers in individual cabins where the virus had killed eight people and infected more than 700. The situation on his ship had the potential to be far worse: nearly 5,000 sailors crammed in shared berths, sometimes stacked three high. Eight of his sailors with severe Covid-19 symptoms had already been evacuated to the Navy’s hospital in Guam.
On March 30, after four days of rebuffs from his superiors, Captain Crozier sat down to compose an email. “Sailors don’t need to die,” he wrote to 20 other people, all Navy personnel in the Pacific, asking for help. A Naval Academy graduate with nearly 30 years of military service, the captain knew the email would most likely end his career, his friends said in interviews. The military prizes its chain of command, and the appropriate course would have been for the captain to continue to push his superiors for action.
He hit “send” anyway.Three weeks later, the fired captain is battling the coronavirus himself, 584 other crew members have tested positive and the acting Navy secretary has resigned. The secretary, Thomas B. Modly, removed the captain because he thought that was what President Trump wanted, officials said. Mr. Modly, the officials said, was keenly aware that his predecessor in the job had been fired after tangling with Mr. Trump. But in trying to please the president, Mr. Modly miscalculated and destroyed his own career.
The story of the Theodore Roosevelt encapsulates, aboard a single aircraft carrier, Mr. Trump’s tumultuous three and a half years as commander in chief. The episode shows how the military, the most structured and hierarchical part of the government, has tried to adjust to an erratic president, and how in a hollowed-out leadership, acting secretaries have replaced those confirmed by the Senate.
Early Monday, the Navy announced that a sailor assigned to the Roosevelt had died of complications stemming from the coronavirus, marking the first death of a crew member from the ship. The sailor had been admitted into intensive care at the naval hospital in Guam on April 9 after being found unconscious in bed.
The Navy’s investigation into the entire episode is expected to be made public this week.This article is based on interviews with two dozen current and former Navy and Defense Department civilian and uniformed personnel, including Roosevelt crew members. Many spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential meetings and discussions.
A Port Call UnravelsSailors aboard the Roosevelt most likely picked up the virus at a port call in Da Nang, Vietnam, on March 5 — just the second visit by an American aircraft carrier to that country since the end of the Vietnam War.
At the time, 16 coronavirus cases had been reported in Vietnam, all in the northern part of the country, far from Da Nang. The top Navy officer in the Pacific, Adm. Philip S. Davidson, ordered the long-scheduled visit to proceed as an important show of American military strength in a region increasingly unnerved by Beijing’s growing territorial claims in the South China Sea.
Da Nang’s piers are too small for a ship of the Roosevelt’s size to dock. So for its brief port call, it anchored offshore, relying on small boats to ferry the crew to the docks. Crew members posted pictures to social media of rooftop hotel pools and relaxation. One post said, “feelin vietnamazing.”
On the fourth and final day in Da Nang, after dozens of sailors had spent at least one night in a hotel where two British nationals tested positive for the virus, the Roosevelt ordered some crew members back to the ship for fear they might be exposed. Those who had stayed at the hotel were immediately isolated.
The Roosevelt went back out to sea, and its medical team watched closely for any sign of sickened sailors — a ticking clock during the 14-day period when symptoms would most likely appear. Over those same 14 days, aircraft flew on and off the ship, bringing in supplies from Japan and the Philippines.
Then came the announcement over the shipwide loudspeakers at dawn on March 24 as the carrier steamed through the western Pacific. “Set River City 1,” a voice ordered.
The sailors knew something had happened. River City means Reduced Communications — no internet access or phone calls for most of the crew.
Soon after, sailors posted outside the massive ship’s medical bays turned away crew members for anything that was not an emergency. Soon everyone knew: Three sailors had tested positive for the virus. The outbreak started in the reactor department, with its crew members responsible for running the very heart of the ship: the nuclear reactors.
The three were flown from the ship to a Navy hospital in Guam. Two days later, on March 26, the Roosevelt docked in Guam. Covid-19 testing began for the entire crew.
The argument between Captain Crozier and his superior aboard the ship, Rear Adm. Stuart P. Baker, began. The Navy high command, including Mr. Modly, was also on alert back in Washington.
Captain Crozier argued for evacuating nearly the entire crew. He wanted them quarantined and tested while the ship was professionally cleaned. A skeleton crew of 500 would remain aboard to operate the ship’s nuclear reactors, safeguard bombs and missiles and warplanes, and perform other essential duties.
Admiral Baker, who as commander of the carrier strike group oversees the Roosevelt and seven other ships, countered that less drastic measures would still protect the crew and leave the Roosevelt in operation. Mr. Modly and residents of Guam also expressed concerns that the island could not house all of the carrier’s crew if the order was given to evacuate, in particular if a growing number tested positive.
The Navy considered alternatives, including sending the Roosevelt to Okinawa, Japan, or to San Diego. Another option was to leave 4,000 sailors aboard the ship and 1,000 in a base gymnasium on Guam, where they would sleep on cots several feet apart. But a first attempt at housing some of the crew at the gym quickly resulted in more cases of the virus.
Back in Washington, Mr. Modly directed a top aide to contact Captain Crozier to ensure he was getting what he needed. The aide, Mr. Modly said later, reported that the captain was satisfied, “only asking that he wished the crew could be evacuated faster.”
But at this point, Captain Crozier was composing a four-page letter to be sent by unclassified email. In the recipient line, the header was bland: REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE IN RESPONSE TO COVID-19 PANDEMIC.
The contents of the letter were not.“There are two end states T.R. could achieve,” Captain Crozier wrote. “We go to war with the force we have and fight sick.” In that situation, he wrote, “there will be losses to the virus.” Or, he wrote, the ship could try to “achieve a COVID-free T.R.,” with all the necessary evacuation.
“As war is not imminent, we recommend pursuing the peace time end state,” Captain Crozier wrote. He showed the email to a handful of the most senior officers on the ship. They told him they wanted to sign it, too. Captain Crozier, fearing for their careers, told them no.
Captain Crozier’s letter ran headlong into the administration’s narrative that it had everything under control.
A Communications BreakdownThe next day, March 31, as Mr. Modly arrived in Los Angeles to visit the Navy hospital ship Mercy, an aide had some news for him. A copy of Captain Crozier’s letter, which had not been sent to Mr. Modly, had found its way to The San Francisco Chronicle presumably leaked by one of the 20 recipients. The letter was spreading rapidly to other news outlets as well.
Mr. Modly was furious, although he restrained himself on a conference call with reporters the next day. “It’s disappointing to have him say that,” he told the reporters. “We’re doing everything we can.”
Worried that Captain Crozier’s letter would anger Mr. Trump, Mr. Modly called colleagues asking for advice, officials said. Should he fire Captain Crozier? Most of them, including Adm. Michael M. Gilday, the chief of naval operations, and Gen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told him he should order an investigation into the incident and wait and see the outcome.
But Mr. Modly, a Naval Academy graduate and former Navy helicopter pilot who was hoping to become the permanent Navy secretary, was still worried about what the president wanted, officials said. Mr. Modly’s predecessor, Richard V. Spencer, was fired for opposing the president’s intervention in support of Chief Petty Officer Edward Gallagher, a Navy SEAL charged with war crimes who became a darling of Mr. Trump.
During a phone conversation with one adviser, Mr. Modly suddenly interrupted and said, according to a person familiar with the discussion, “Oh, breaking, the president wants him fired.” The person surmised that Mr. Modly had received a text message informing him of the president’s views.
On April 2, Mr. Modly called Admiral Baker, Captain Crozier’s immediate boss on the Roosevelt, and asked him if he knew about the letter in advance. Admiral Baker said that he did not, and that he would have told Captain Crozier not to send it. As Mr. Modly explained in an interview he later gave to the Washington Post columnist David Ignatius, he decided to fire Captain Crozier after that conversation.
Later that morning, Mr. Modly told Admiral Gilday, General Milley and Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper that he had decided to fire Captain Crozier even before an investigation was conducted. The three told him they would publicly support his decision, despite the reservations of General Milley and Admiral Gilday.
Representative Adam Smith, the Washington Democrat who is the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, condemned the move, as did three other Democrats on the panel. But they acknowledged that Captain Crozier might have mishandled the situation.
“Throwing the commanding officer overboard without a thorough investigation is not going to solve the growing crisis aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt,” the lawmakers said in a statement. “What’s more, we are very concerned about the chilling effect this dismissal will have on commanders throughout the Department of Defense.”
The dismissal and subsequent investigation hit the ship’s medical department hard right away. The same day Captain Crozier walked off the ship for the last time, Adm. Robert P. Burke, the Navy’s second-highest admiral, called the senior medical officer aboard the carrier as part of his investigation. Admiral Burke criticized the doctor, saying he had failed as a leader. In interviews, two crew members said Admiral Burke’s tone was hostile.
In an email, the Navy’s chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Charles W. Brown, said Admiral Burke “spoke with multiple individuals involved during the course of his investigation into the communication aboard U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt and with the chain of command.”
‘I Stand by Every Word’As Captain Crozier walked off his ship and down the gangway wearing a black backpack and baseball cap, hundreds of sailors and aircrew members showed up on the hangar bay to form a corridor for him. Videos of the crew cheering and shouting “Captain Crozier” immediately went viral.
And that, Navy officials said, infuriated Mr. Modly. His next actions stunned Pentagon officials and effectively turned the crew of the Roosevelt even more solidly against him.
Mr. Modly boarded a Gulfstream business jet at an airfield in suburban Washington and made the 35-hour round-trip flight to Guam, at a cost of $243,116.65, according to a Navy official, confirming a report in USA Today. When he landed, he spoke with Mr. Ignatius to defend himself. He also wrote a letter to The New York Times in which he again criticized the captain he had fired and who had, by now, tested positive for the coronavirus.
Then he went to the Roosevelt and delivered a 15-minute diatribe over the ship’s loudspeakers berating the crew for cheering for its captain. He called Captain Crozier either “too naïve” or “too stupid” to command an aircraft carrier. He told the sailors they should never trust the media. He blamed China for the virus. Less than 30 minutes later, after taking no questions from the sailors, he was gone.
Within another 30 minutes of his visit, audio of his remarks was being shared broadly across social media, complete with crew reaction. “What the…?” one sailor was heard saying when Mr. Modly called Captain Crozier “stupid.”
Navy officials, inundated with calls from incredulous reporters, called Mr. Modly — now flying back from Guam — asking him to respond. He doubled down, issuing a statement that “I stand by every word I said.”
By now, lawmakers were calling for him to be fired. So, too, were current and former military officials.
“What he said to the crew, I just completely disagree with that,” Mike Mullen, a retired admiral who was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, said in an interview. “The content of it, how he said it, and actually, even that he was there on that ship to say it.”
Mr. Modly’s plane landed at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington on Monday night. In a phone call, Mr. Esper told him that he had to apologize, Defense Department officials said.
Seven hours after issuing his “I stand by every word I said” statement, Mr. Modly backpedaled. “I do not think Captain Brett Crozier is naïve nor stupid,” he said. “I think and always believed him to be the opposite.”
But the damage had been done. The next day, Mr. Modly, now in isolation himself because of potential exposure to the virus during his trip to the ship, called Mr. Esper to offer his resignation. A spokesman for Mr. Modly did not respond to a request for comment.
As for Captain Crozier, he remains alone in the “distinguished visitors quarters” on Naval Base Guam, battling a coronavirus infection. The 584 other crew members who have tested positive are also in quarantine on Guam, along with nearly 4,000 sailors who have been moved off the ship. One sailor with the virus remains in intensive care at the naval hospital on the island.
Navy officials say the Roosevelt may be fully cleaned and ready to resume its operations in the Pacific this month. More than 345,000 people have signed an online petition to reinstate Captain Crozier, a step that Admiral Gilday did not rule out last week.
Amid the fallout from Captain Crozier’s letter, senior military officials say they are concerned about other warships and other missions.
“From my perspective, I think it’s not a good idea to think that the Teddy Roosevelt is a one-of-a-kind issue,” Gen. John E. Hyten, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said on Thursday. “To think that it will never happen again is not a good way to plan.”

The Fed says it will name companies that participate in its lending programs.The Federal Reserve will disclose the names of companies that benefit from its lending programs, it announced Thursday, a sign that the central bank is willing to provide the kind of transparency lawmakers have been urging.
The central bank will release the names and details of participants in each of its programs, the amount borrowed and interest rate charged, and overall costs, revenues and fees, it said. The Fed will publish program reports on its website at least every 30 days.
Congress has handed the Treasury Department $454 billion to back up Fed lending facilities, which either make loans or buy bonds to keep credit flowing in key market segments. With that layer of taxpayer insurance, the Fed has announced programs that are meant to help midsize businesses, state governments and large corporations.
But the backing came with some reporting requirements, as do the Fed’s emergency lending authorities in general: Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin must regularly report to Congress on the programs, for instance. It was unclear how detailed those explanations would be until Thursday’s release laid out the parameters.
“The Federal Reserve is committed to transparency and accountability,” Mr. Powell said in the release.
L Brands fires back after the buyer of Victoria’s Secret tries to pull out.
L Brands, the owner of Victoria’s Secret, shot back at the private equity firm that has been trying to terminate its acquisition of the retail chain
The effort on the part of the firm, Sycamore Partners, to end the deal because of the coronavirus outbreak is “invalid” and “pure gamesmanship” after it failed to renegotiate the price, L Brands said in a Delaware court filing on Thursday
The dispute has become the most prominent example of a buyer trying to back out of a deal because of the pandemic.
Sycamore said on Wednesday that L Brands had violated terms of its February transaction agreement and that a “material adverse effect” occurred because of the pandemic, allowing it to terminate the deal to buy 55 percent of Victoria’s Secret for about $525 million.
L Brands said on Thursday that when the deal was negotiated, “the world was already well aware of the existence of Covid-19, and the parties agreed that Sycamore would bear the risk of any adverse impacts stemming from such a pandemic.” The definition of a “material adverse effect” explicitly carved out impacts from pandemics, the company said.
The company called Sycamore’s stance “pure gamesmanship.” Sycamore sent L Brands a letter on April 13 saying that it wanted to renegotiate the purchase price and other terms of the deal because of the coronavirus outbreak, according to L Brands. When the company declined to renegotiate — because the agreement “expressly allocates the risk of pandemics to Sycamore” — the private equity firm sent a termination notice and filed the subsequent lawsuit, according to the filing.
Early May is too soon to reopen auto factories, the U.A.W. says.
The United Automobile Workers union said on Thursday that it was opposed to companies restarting auto production next month, saying it is not yet safe for its members to return to work.
“At this point in time, the U.A.W. does not believe the scientific data is conclusive that it is safe to have our members back in the workplace,” the union’s president, Rory Gamble, said in a statement. “We have not done enough testing to really understand the threat our members face.”
The union represents more than 400,000 workers and is an influential voice in the labor movement and manufacturing industry.
Mr. Gamble added the union supported an extension of the stay-at-home order in effect in Michigan. That order, by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, expires on April 30 but she has said she expected an extension was warranted.
“We strongly suggest to our companies that an early May date is too soon and too risky to our members, their families, and their communities,” Mr. Gamble said.
General Motors, Ford Motor and Fiat Chrysler have been discussing with the union when and how they will reopen plants.
The union’s statement comes as some nonunion automakers announce plans to resume production in southern states that have not been hit as hard by the virus as Michigan, where 3,000 people, including more than two dozen U.A.W. members, have died from the coronavirus.
Earlier on Thursday, Toyota Motor said it was preparing to restart operations at its U.S. plants on May 4. Volkswagen has said it would begin phasing in production at its U.S. plant on May 3.
Stocks lose steam but oil prices continue their rebound.
Stocks on Wall Street ended virtually unchanged on Thursday as an early rally, fueled by a surge in oil prices, faded.
The S&P 500, which rose as much as 1.6 percent earlier in the day, was flat by the close of trading. The ups and downs came as investors absorbed more grim economic news: Millions more workers claimed unemployment benefits in the United States and data from Europe highlighted the heavy toll of shutdowns to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
Investors have been shrugging off such data in recent weeks, as the shock of the economic devastation caused by the coronavirus pandemic fades and they begin to expect an eventual recovery.
Governments have started to discuss measures to return to normal. Businesses in Europe and the United States have begun to detail their plans to reopen businesses. Major airlines have already aggressively advertised the precautions they are taking to lure back passengers, from fogging cabins with disinfectant to restricting food service to blocking out middle seats.
Lawmakers in Washington continue to advance measures to support the economy. The House will vote on Thursday on a $484 billion coronavirus package that would revive a depleted loan program for distressed small businesses and provide funds for hospitals and testing.
More than 26 million people have filed jobless claims in the last five weeks.
The grim economic toll from the coronavirus pandemic jumped on Thursday when the government reported another 4.4 million people filed new unemployment claims last week, bringing the five-week total to more than 26 million.
The report is likely to intensify the debate over when to lift restrictions that have helped fight the virus’s spread but placed the economy in a stranglehold, reports Patricia Cohen of The Times.
“At all levels, it’s eye-watering numbers,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank Securities. But as large as the figures have been, they do not capture the full extent of layoffs — or the cascade of economic troubles that they have set in motion.
Problems responding to the waves of jobless claims now will affect the shape of the recovery when the pandemic eases, Mr. Slok said. Laid-off workers need money quickly to pay for rent, groceries and credit card bills. If they cannot do so, he said, the hole that the larger economy has fallen into “gets deeper and deeper, and more difficult to crawl out of.”
The Treasury warns big companies not to take small-business loans.
The Trump administration warned big companies on Thursday that they must prove they were in need of emergency small business loans to keep their operations running and had no other option to get financing or repay the funds.
The new guidance from the Treasury Department came amid an uproar over bigger companies taking loans through the Paycheck Protection Program while smaller businesses have been left out.
The Treasury Department updated its “Frequently Asked Questions” page about the P.P.P. to urge “large companies with adequate sources of liquidity” to think twice before applying for loans backed by the Small Business Administration.
The S.B.A.’s $349 billion fund to support these loans ran out last week and is expected to be replenished with another $310 billion this week. Backlash over the program has been escalating after some big restaurant chains took out multiple $10 million loans for their subsidiaries.
Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned businesses that they would be investigated and could face penalties if they improperly accept small-business money. He has urged such businesses to return those funds. The guidance released on Thursday said borrowers that repaid loans in full by May 7, 2020, would be deemed by the S.B.A. to have made their certifications in good faith, leaving them in good standing with the government.
At least five companies have already given back the funds: Shake Shack, Sweetgreen, Kura Sushi USA, ItWorks! and the owner of Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse, have all disclosed that they have returned the P.P.P. loans.
Another publicly traded company, Wave Life Sciences USA, announced on Thursday it was returning $7.2 million in a loan from JPMorgan Chase, one of the banks that handled aid applications using a two-tiered system that heavily favored larger companies and wealthy clients over the smallest businesses.
“We made this decision after the S.B.A. issued new guidance that states, in effect, that public companies are not appropriate recipients of these loans,” ” a spokeswoman for the company, Alicia Suter, said in an email.
Entrepreneurs are learning in real time how to adapt to survive.
A Memphis food tour company joined with local restaurants to offer a special meal and video tour to locals. The owners of a Detroit bar and scent shop froze cocktail mixers into ice cubes so patrons could just add liquor at home to mix the perfect drink. A laundry service for Airbnb rentals in Minneapolis started a curbside business for people stuck inside their homes.
Small-businesses owners across the country are looking for ways to survive the coronavirus pandemic, even as they fill out paperwork for federal stimulus funds that they no longer believe they can count on. They are adapting their business models and innovating products so that they, and their employees, can get back to work.
“Small businesses are really great at staying nimble,” said Laura Huang, associate professor at Harvard Business School and author of “Edge: Turning Adversity Into Advantage.” The ones that succeed, she said, “understand that even though they are looking to do new, innovative things, they need to grow where they are planted.”
That means that small-business owners should not completely change what they do but find new ways to deliver their product, dust off old ideas, experiment with existing strengths, search for new customers or change their story.
Macy’s plans its Fourth of July fireworks show, but the expense is questioned.
When Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said on Wednesday that Macy’s and its chief executive, Jeff Gennette, were committed to holding its annual Fourth of July fireworks display, he called the gesture “generous” and “really patriotic.”
But critics questioned the expense at a time when most of Macy’s 123,000 employees have been furloughed. The retailer, which also owns Bloomingdales and Bluemercury, is facing intense financial pressure with the temporary closure of its stores.
“Macy’s should not be spending millions on fireworks displays while its own work force is out of work,” Stuart Appelbaum, president of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, said in a statement on Thursday. The company should be spending the money on health care coverage for employees instead, he added.
Macy’s does not disclose the cost of the show, though Mr. de Blasio suggested in a briefing on Thursday that this year’s display might be more modest. Macy’s said the display dates to 1976 and that this year’s show “will be a celebration of the strength and resilience of New York City and will honor frontline workers across America.”
Mr. de Blasio defended the plans to proceed with the pyrotechnics show. “I don’t think it’s an either-or,” he said. “Macy’s put aside the resources to provide this celebration.” The cost of the show, he added, was “small compared to the needs of working people.”
Catch up: Here’s what else is happening.Intel, one of the world’s largest computer chip makers, said Thursday that revenue climbed 23 percent to $19.8 billion during the quarter ending in March, an indication that parts of the computer industry are thriving amid the coronavirus pandemic. The company expects revenue to be $18.5 billion in the current quarter — up $2 billion from last year.Besieged by the economic tumult created by the coronavirus, the private equity giant Blackstone swung to a loss of $2.6 billion in the first quarter, a steep slide from the same period last year, when the company reported $1.1 billion in profit.Starting Friday, all 25,000 United Airlines flight attendants will be required to wear masks while on duty, the airline said. United is the first major U.S. airline to mandate masks. The union that represents flight attendants there and at more than a dozen other airlines separately asked the Transportation Department and Health and Human Services Department to mandate the same industrywide.Exxon Mobil said on Thursday it would produce medical-grade hand sanitizer in Louisiana.

ANNAPOLIS, Md. — Larry Hogan was annoyed. On a conference call, Mr. Hogan, the Republican governor of Maryland, had just learned that several South Korean companies were ready to ship more coronavirus test kits to his state. But they were stymied because the Food and Drug Administration had not yet approved their use.
“I don’t care if we have F.D.A. approval or not,” Mr. Hogan said into a speakerphone in the governor’s reception room, where he was flanked by a container of Purell and a 9 a.m. Diet Coke, with aides sitting six feet apart around a large table. “We’ve got people dying,” he said, adding, “I don’t want to wait for permission.”
Frustrated by limited support and unclear guidance from the Trump administration, governors across the country, including some Republicans, have been squaring off with the White House and striking out on their own to secure supplies. Mr. Hogan, in his second term in a very blue state, has tried to stay miles ahead of the virus’s incursion here, like several other governors — notably Jay Inslee of Washington and Mike DeWine of Ohio — whose responses have been given better marks from Americans than the president’s.
Mr. Hogan put his health department on alert in early January when he saw the virus’s deadly crawl through China. On Monday, he issued a stay-at-home order for residents, a few weeks after declaring a state of emergency when the first three cases emerged in Maryland last month.
He is also the head of the National Governors Association, charged with representing governors’ needs at the White House, where officials wish he would find it in his heart to say a few flattering words about Mr. Trump now and then. Instead he has bluntly demanded more aid from Washington, including more test kits and supplies and help shoring up state budgets.
“We’re still not satisfied” with the federal response to states’ needs, Mr. Hogan said this week.
Mr. Hogan has also found himself the de facto leader of the response in the Washington, D.C., metro area, where the disease has begun its exponential march. The governor of Virginia and the mayor of Washington — a city where the death rate is well above the national average — instantly followed his order this week, grounding around 15 million residents.
As of Thursday night, there have been at least 4,697 confirmed cases and 89 deaths in the three areas combined, about triple from a week ago. The two states and Washington have an unusually intrinsic relationship; they share a metro system and are home to thousands of federal workers who are central to the region’s work force and the functioning of federal government.
Mr. Hogan’s moves have major implications for the region. He has immediately hit those defiantly socializing with some of the largest fines or criminal charges in the nation. There have already been two arrests in Maryland, including of a man who hosted a bonfire party for about 60 people after the state banned large groups.
His aggressive policing is one of several reasons Mr. Hogan has slid onto center stage among governors whose states have been hammered by the coronavirus.
This week, he collaborated with a Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, on an opinion piece pleading for federal assistance — after President Trump attacked her as “that woman.” He has been a critic of the president’s overly optimistic prognostications, saying Mr. Trump’s assurances that testing problems were a thing of the past were simply not true.
For Mr. Hogan, the need to respond quickly is also personal. He is a recent cancer survivor and over 60, which puts him in a high-risk group for the virus. His preparation for this moment, he said, was seeded in the 2015 Baltimore riots, which happened 90 days into his first term.
“I knew that taking quick decisive action was better than hesitating,” he said in a (socially distant) interview in his office on Wednesday. “I think the public was not where I was on the knowledge. There were folks saying this is no big deal, it’s not as bad as the flu, it’s going to disappear. And I was saying, ‘No, it’s worse.’”
Some Democrats in Maryland have praised him for his aggressive response.“Look, I’m a Democrat,” said Mary Pat Clarke, a city councilwoman from Baltimore. “But the governor has done an excellent job leading the state of Maryland through the Covid-19 state of our lives. He has been regular, he has been firm, he has been clear.”
With an eye on the virus’s rampage of China, Mr. Hogan convened a special session during the governors’ meeting in February. They met with top health officials, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, right before the governors ran to put on formal wear for a White House dinner.
“Very little was being talked about,” Mr. Hogan said. “It was sort of an eye-opener for a lot of the governors, but I think some of them still didn’t take it seriously.”
He, however, began to feel something akin to panic.“The next day I came back to my team and said, ‘This is what I just heard, we have to get ready,’” he said. “We knew that it wasn’t going to be long before we were going to have to deal with it.”
Mr. Hogan has also leaned on his wife, Yumi Hogan, a Korean immigrant, who was also at the governor’s convention, which included a dinner at the Korean ambassador’s home. As the first Korean first lady in American history, Ms. Hogan has become something of an icon in South Korea. “I just grabbed my wife and said, ‘Look, you speak Korean. You know the president. You know the first lady. You know the ambassador. Let’s talk to them in Korean, and tell them we need their help.’” Several companies in South Korea immediately said they would send tests.
Mr. Hogan’s super-cop moves have not endeared him to some conservatives who largely populate the more southern and rural parts of the state.
“I think the bubble the Governor is in is missing something,” Gregory Kline, a longtime conservative activist in the state, said on Twitter. “There was no acknowledgment that his directions were doing harm to people greater than this disease would do or even that suffering is occurring not because of the disease but the executive fiat fighting it.”
Mr. Hogan is one of the few elected Republicans in the country who have publicly countered Mr. Trump’s early claims about the state of the virus, and more crucially about the amount of tests and ventilators available to states.
“I don’t think I’ve ever crossed the line and been rude or tried to attack or point fingers or place blame. But I have been willing to stand up when other people haven’t,” he said. He added, “Certainly some of my Republican colleagues probably might think I go too far. Some of the Democratic colleagues might not think I go far enough. But I’m not trying to place blame.”
Some officials said that the state could be faster in giving basic directives and that, like Mr. Hogan, they wished they could get more protective gear. “There are not enough supplies for health care workers and essential employees,” said State Senator Jill Carter, a Democrat.
Maryland has received far fewer N95 masks, respirators and gloves than it has requested from the federal government, according to documents released on Thursday by the House Committee on Oversight and Reform. And it has received none of the 100,000 swabs it requested for coronavirus test kits.
Mr. Hogan said his decisions were informed principally by health care professionals, many of them culled from the University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, among other local health care providers.
“I’m not an expert on this, but I’m going to listen to the smartest guys in the room,” he said, adding: “These guys say if we don’t act now, we’re going to have this surge, we’re not going to have ventilators, we’re going to overload the system. We’re not going to have enough health care workers, we’re going to look like New York, and there’s going to be bodies stacked up.”
Every day, there are dozens of decisions to be made over conference calls. Pay some state workers extra who have been called upon to report to work when most other Marylanders are being asked to remain home? Yes. How about for workers who check on child abuse reports? Also yes. Palm Sunday services permitted in church parking lots? Yes, but no passing of a collection plate. This debate went on for some time. “We don’t like government telling churches what to do,” Mr. Hogan said, “but we don’t want 2 million people to die.”"

LONDON — Within hours of the British government announcing that its National Health Service could no longer dedicate the resources to test every suspected case of coronavirus, a doctor at a private clinic in London began procuring supplies of screening kits that he has since been selling for three times what they cost.
“I know that a lot of people are slagging me off for racketeering,” said the doctor, Mark Ali, using a British term to refer to the insults he had received. Within a week, he had taken in 2.6 million pounds in orders, about $3 million.
“On the contrary,” he said in defense of his activities. “I met a national need at the point when the government was doing little.”
Widespread testing for the coronavirus has since emerged as a central pillar of the British government’s strategy to combat the outbreak. But private clinics, labs and go-between distributors have jumped at the opportunity to trade in testing services, snapping up supplies of diagnostic kits that the government badly needs.
[Update: Boris Johnson, U.K. Prime Minister, has the coronavirus.]Adding to the concerns, some of the kits have been sold at a steep markup, bringing accusations of profiteering. Many are also unreliable, producing false negatives and false positives. Some are outright fakes.
Britain, like the United States, changed tactics after its leaders came under fierce criticism for initially failing to test widely enough. It now aims to test 25,000 hospital patients a day, and Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Monday that the government would buy “millions of testing kits that will enable us to turn the tide on this invisible killer.”
Public health officials have said that they are in discussions with nearly two dozen private firms about coronavirus testing systems and that they had signed a deal worth about $1.2 million with one laboratory to provide the kits.
While there is little doubt that the government will reach its goal, experts say the authorities should not have to compete with private companies for testing kits or for other important items at this crucial moment.
“A scarce, vital resource like testing must be thought of as a public resource, no matter whether it’s produced and provided by the government or the private sector,” said Dr. Jonathan Quick of the Duke Global Health Institute in the United States, who is a former director of medicine policy at the World Health Organization. “Not to do so further endangers everyone,” he added.
That has not stopped some companies from trying to cash in, which is not strictly speaking illegal but can carry a stigma.
Consider AlphaBioLabs, a small private service in northwestern England that was, until now, probably best known for carrying out DNA tests on “The Jeremy Kyle Show,” a tabloid-style daytime TV program in Britain that was canceled last year.
In a statement published on March 20, the lab said it had been “shocked and saddened to receive so many desperate inquiries from front-line organizations, such as the N.H.S., needing the Covid-19 screening test.” The company pledged to sell its “initial stock” to the National Health Service at cost, but did not say how many testing kits that included.
Three days earlier, AlphaBioLabs — which has since stopped marketing the test to the public — had announced that it would be selling its kit for £125. One newspaper hailed the news with the headline: “Brit lab’s new finger-prick test can ‘detect virus in 15 minutes.’”
But the British lab did not create the test. The one advertised on its website was made by an American company, BioMedomics. Each kit costs around $2 to manufacture and no more than $9 to buy wholesale. 
David Thomas, managing director of AlphaBioLabs, said that the cost of the test was only one expense in their marketing. The company also pays for a demonstration by a medical worker and online tutorials for businesses with larger orders. He also pointed to rising component costs, and packaging and logistical expenses.
Mr. Thomas declined to answer questions about how much profit the company made per test or how many it had sold, but he said that the profit margin was “very modest and in line with industry norms.”
BioMedomics confirmed that the British lab had placed an order for coronavirus tests — a minimum order is 1,000 kits — but would not provide any further details. “As a small company,” said a spokesman, Kent Lupino, “while we try to vet resellers as best we can, we do not have control over all those who would use this pandemic as an opportunity to blatantly profiteer from those in need.”
AlphaBioLabs said it was hoping to clear its backlog of orders and had enlisted manufacturers with offices in China, Germany and the United States, but refused to name them. Going forward, Mr. Thomas said, the lab would sell the tests only to the N.H.S., emergency services and to businesses classified by the government as “critical infrastructure companies.”
“AlphaBioLabs is absolutely not profiteering from this global health pandemic, but providing a vital service which is in great demand,” he added.
Annelise Wilder-Smith, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that governments should set a cap on the price and number of tests available through the private sector.
“While I am all for liberal and extensive testing, and am not against the private sector offering testing,” she said, “the government needs to clamp down on any exploitation during a time of crisis.”

Dr. Ali, who runs the Private Harley Street Clinic in London, said he was unrepentant about his trading, after taking orders for nearly 7,000 tests at £375 each. He said he had donated 100 tests to the N.H.S.
“I’m entirely comfortable with the price, and if somebody else wants to offer it for less, that’s fine,” he said in an interview. “I believe the people should be tested, so I’m going to offer it.”
What Dr. Ali is offering for that £375 takes some explanation.The Private Harley Street Clinic does not manufacture the coronavirus test kits, nor does it distribute them or process any test results. Yet it has sold the testing kits for more than three times the £120 that the manufacturer, Randox Laboratories in Northern Ireland, charges the public directly.
Once ordered on the Private Harley Street Clinic website, the tests are shipped from Randox directly to customers without ever passing through the clinic. Dr. Ali declined to say what he paid for the kits and claimed not to know what profit he had made, but he said that his price included clinical advice.
Private Harley Street Clinic’s main asset appears to be the marketing value its name brings through an association with the renowned medical street in London — despite company records showing that the “clinic” is actually based at Dr. Ali’s apartment, miles away in North London.
The firm was incorporated in 2017 shortly after Dr. Ali’s two previous companies, which had almost identical names, were struck off the government’s register of companies for failing to provide required financial data. Private Harley Street Clinic was also threatened with being struck off until it posted financial accounts last summer, which showed that it had total net assets of less than £200.
Dr. Ali said that his clinic had delivered orders for tests worth £1 million so far and that he had been so overwhelmed with requests that he had been forced to hire temporary employees to take calls. The doctor said he planned to hire more staff members this week to help cope with the surge.
“I basically had to create a war cabinet,” he said. “We’re responding to a national emergency.”But despite the extra staffing, and assurances on his website that customers would receive their test returns within three days, the first results were expected to start arriving on Tuesday, more than a week after the service was introduced.
Dr. Ali said that he knew it would be “absolute pandemonium,” but he said that he had been left short after Randox failed to deliver the thousand tests a day that he had been promised andthat his customers had already paid for.
Randox is one of the private labs in discussions with public health officials in Britain about providing tests, but it has already been overwhelmed with demand from the private sector. If the lab did sign a deal with the N.H.S., Dr. Ali said, he would stop selling the kits privately.
Amy Millar, a spokeswoman for Randox, confirmed that the company was “in discussions with various health bodies, including Public Health England, on how to utilize the test to help” in the coronavirus response. The company added that it had developed the test for a “very competitive price” but had “no control” over what retailers charged or what customers were prepared to pay.
Neither of the tests developed by Randox or BioMedomics have been approved by the British or American authorities, though both are accredited labs and have European health and safety certification.
Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for Britain, said last week that the government was in talks with several companies about antibody tests but warned that officials were still not sure that the kits “currently on the market are the right ones.”
The official advice is for people to avoid rapid, at-home coronavirus tests because there was “little evidence to the accuracy of their tests.” Indeed, AlphaBioLabs acknowledged that “screening testing devices are known and accepted by scientists to not be as accurate as laboratory confirmatory testing.”
Professor Wilder-Smith of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that that was why the government needed to take control of testing, to determine “who sells tests where, at what price and at what standard.”
“Both a false positive and a false negative test will have negative consequences,” she noted.Other kits, however, are just fraudulent.
Last week, the European Anti-Fraud Office began an inquiry into fake coronavirus products, including counterfeit test kits, masks, medical devices and sanitizers, that were being sold around the world for “potentially huge illicit profits.”
A few days after the investigation was opened, a 59-year-old man, Frank Ludlow, appeared in court in Brighton, southern England, accused of making fake kits that he had touted as a treatment for the novel coronavirus but that actually contained potentially harmful chemicals.
He was arrested after the law enforcement authorities in Los Angeles intercepted a package containing 60 of the fake kits."

First it was the waitress whose restaurant closed. Then the waiter, the bartender, the substitute teacher, the hairdresser, the tattoo artist and the Walgreens manager.
One after the other, the tenants called and emailed their landlord, Bruce Brunner, to say they were out of work and the rent was going to be late. A week after the bill was due, some two dozen of Mr. Brunner’s 130 tenants had lost their jobs or had their hours reduced. He’s working out payment plans and using security deposits as a stopgap while directing tenants to the emerging patchwork of local, state and federal assistance programs.
“Six weeks ago, you could name your price and you’d have multiple people applying,” said Mr. Brunner, who lives in Minneapolis, where he owns and manages 20 duplexes and triplexes across the city. “Now you’re deferring and working out payment plans, and it’s only going to get worse.”
One week after the first of the month, tenants nationwide are already struggling with rents. In interviews with two dozen landlords — including companies with tens of thousands of units, nonprofit developers who house the working poor, and mom-and-pop operators living next door to their tenants — property owners say their collections have plunged as much of the economy has shut down to prevent the spread of the deadly coronavirus.
Daryl Carter, chief executive of Avanath Capital, a Southern California company with 10,000 units across the country, said his buildings reduced April rents by 10 percent. Deidre Schmidt, chief executive of CommonBond Communities, a nonprofit affordable-housing provider with about 6,000 apartments in the Midwest, expects as many as 40 percent of her tenants, most of them hourly workers with low incomes, to fall behind on their monthly bills. Joseph Razavian, a part-time landlord in Atlanta who works at a software company but owns a duplex and a triplex as investments, is bolstering his reserve fund by putting off nonessential maintenance like fresh paint and new rain gutters.
“The whole market just changed,” said Gustavo Lopez, a property manager in the San Francisco Bay Area.
Nearly 10 million people have filed unemployment claims over the past two weeks. It’s too early to gauge how broadly these numbers will translate to the loss of rent: Many tenants are within the grace period before their rent is declared late. Some can stitch things together for a while by getting deferrals, applying their security deposits or paying with credit cards.
Still, early findings suggest that April is looking bad and lend credence to Mr. Brunner’s opinion that May will be much worse. The National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade group for big apartment owners and developers, compiled data tracking rent payments across some 13.4 million units nationwide. It showed that through the first five days of April, 31 percent of tenants had so far failed to pay their rent, compared with 18 percent in the same period a year ago.
That lined up with surveys released by Apartment List, a rental listing service; Mynd Property Management; and Avail, a platform that helps small landlords manage rentals. All showed the share of partial or unpaid rent surging to as much as a quarter of billings, compared with March or last April.
Some tenants are simply moving out. College students are breaking leases to move home. Laid-off workers are showing up at rental offices to exchange their keys for their deposits, saying they are moving in with family members.
And there is Terra Thomas, a florist in Oakland, Calif., who could pay her April rent with savings if she wanted but has decided to withhold the $833 she pays for her studio. With her usually busy wedding season shaping up to be grim, she’d rather conserve her money than pay bills now.
“This could last a long time and be really, really serious, so I don’t want to be asking myself in a few months, ‘Why did I give away my last few paychecks to rent?’” she said. “I need to know that I can eat and pay for health care.”
The $2 trillion CARES Act, signed by President Trump on March 27, should in theory help laid-off tenants keep up with the rent through a combination of expanded unemployment insurance and one-time stimulus payments. The act also included aid to public-housing providers and grants to state governments that could be used for rental assistance.
But only a sliver of the money deals with housing directly. About $12 billion in grants will mostly be given to cities, homeless shelters, affordable-housing providers and states to support people who are homeless and sustain or increase housing assistance. There are big gaps in assistance for tenants as well as landlords, because almost all of it is directed to renters and owners already attached to some sort of government program.
For instance, much of the aid to tenants is earmarked for those living in subsidized and public housing, and much of the mortgage forbearance will benefit landlords whose loans are backed by the government through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This is little help to most moderate- and low-income tenants who live in market-rate developments, or small landlords whose loans are often held by private lenders and not backed by the federal government.
Cities and states have tried to address housing troubles by passing eviction moratoriums, which should prevent an immediate rise in homelessness but doesn’t resolve what happens in three or four months when tenants who have had little or no income are billed for months of back rent.
“Eventually the moratoriums will be lifted, and we don’t want to create an environment where low-income renters fall off a financial cliff and we have a rash of evictions,” said Diane Yentel, chief executive of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, an advocacy group in Washington.
After lobbying for grants to homeless providers in the CARES Act, her group is pushing for $100 billion in direct subsidies to tenants. The National Multifamily Housing Council has called for similar aid. Ms. Yentel, in an interview, cited two objectives: to relieve tenants of rent burden, but also to support small landlords at risk of foreclosure.
For several decades, the nation’s affordable-housing stock has fallen sharply, particularly “naturally occurring affordable housing” — run-down buildings that offer low rents without government subsidy. Since much of this housing is operated by smaller landlords, Ms. Yentel fears that without any aid to landlords, the buildings could go into default and be picked up by investors who will renovate them for higher-paying tenants after the crisis subsides.
“One way or the other, we have to get aid to smaller landlords so that the precious affordable-housing stock we have still exists on the other end of this crisis,” she said.
According to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, a quarter of the nation’s 44 million renter households paid more than half their income in rent in 2018. Separate research from the Federal Reserve showed four in 10 Americans would have difficulty covering a sudden $400 expense, suggesting that tens of millions of tenants are just a week of missed work away from falling behind on their housing bills.
For the past four years, rent increases have helped stir a nationwide tenant uprising that led to the biggest expansion of tenants’ rights in decades. Rent control laws were enacted in New York, Oregon and California, and tenants organized mass actions, like a group of mothers in Oakland who occupied an empty house for two months to protest house flipping.
Now, after years of coordination, organizers see the coronavirus pandemic as a galvanizing force. Last week, the Right to the City Alliance, a national coalition of tenant and racial-justice organizations, held a digital #CancelRent rally to call for rents to be eliminated as long as people can’t work. Homes Guarantee, a national tenants’ campaign, has been holding weekly strategy calls. On Wednesday, a caravan outside US Bank Plaza in Minneapolis honked horns and waved signs to demand rent and mortgage relief.
“This is a moment of clarity about a broken system in which 11 million people were already paying over 50 percent of their income on rent,” said Tara Raghuveer, a tenant organizer in Kansas City and director of Homes Guarantee.
Ms. Thomas, the renter refusing to pay in Oakland, is a member of the Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment, an activist group associated with the house-occupying mothers. For weeks she has been trying to organize her building in a rent strike, and has gotten tenants in three other units to join her.
One is her upstairs neighbor Andrew Yen, a data scientist at an agriculture company who still has a job and isn’t worried about making his $2,500 monthly rent. He and Ms. Thomas had been discussing some sort of coordinated action, but after weeks of job losses, and walking around his neighborhood seeing “rent strike” posted on telephone poles or spray-painted on utility boxes, he decided the time was now, so he is striking in solidarity.
“I feel like rent striking is the least somebody like me can do,” he said. “I’m the tenant the landlord wants to keep, so the worst-case scenario is eviction, but I probably have a lot more wiggle room than that.”"

As millions more Americans lose their jobs, more federal aid is uncertain. The harsh economic toll of the social distancing measures put in place to curb the spread of the pandemic was underscored on Thursday when the Labor Department reported that another 6.6 million people had filed for unemployment benefits last week.
That brought the number of Americans who had lost their jobs over the past three weeks to more than 16 million, which is more job losses than the most recent recession produced over two years. The dire figures suggested that Washington’s recent $2 trillion relief package was not working quickly enough to halt the economic devastation and the hemorrhaging of jobs in nearly every type of industry.
But efforts to bolster the relief package stalled in Washington. The Trump administration asked Congress to quickly approve $250 billion in spending to replenish a new loan program for distressed small businesses, but it hit a roadblock in the Senate on Thursday morning after Republicans and Democrats clashed over what to include.
Democrats want to double the size of the new emergency relief bill by adding $100 billion for hospitals and $150 billion for state and local governments, which are facing enormous shortfalls as the outbreak drives their expenses up and their tax collections down.
Republicans argued that the small business program had a more urgent need for funds, and that additional demands for aid could be addressed in future legislation.
With Congress in recess and lawmakers scattered around the country, Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, tried to push through the small business loan funding during a procedural session, a maneuver that would have required all senators to agree. But Democrats objected.
The House, which is scheduled to convene Friday in a procedural session, is not expected to try to pass either party’s proposal.
With help from Congress uncertain, the Federal Reserve on Thursday took action on its own round of emergency measures to help the economy. The central bank said it would use Treasury Department funds to buy municipal bonds and expand its purchases of corporate bonds. The efforts are aimed at shoring up companies as well as state and local governments, whose budgets are strained.
Positive coronavirus tests rise with age, White House data shows.
The White House coronavirus task force released a breakdown of testing data on Thursday, revealing that older Americans who are tested for the virus are more likely to test positive than other age groups.
Among people who were tested:11 percent of those under 25 were positive.17 percent of those between 25 and 45 were positive.21 percent of those between 45 and 65 were positive.22 percent of those between 65 and 85 were positive.24 percent of those over 85 were positive.Tests for the coronavirus are provided if people show symptoms such as a dry cough, fever or shortness of breath. Women are slightly more likely to get tested than men, although men seem to be more susceptible to the coronavirus, said Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator for the White House. Among women who were tested, 16 percent were positive; 23 percent of men who were tested had coronavirus infections.
The data, while disturbing, does not come entirely as a surprise. Similar trends have been observed in China and Italy, where men were both infected and succumbed to the coronavirus at higher rates than women.
“To all of our men out there, no matter what age group, if you have symptoms, you should be tested,” Dr. Birx said.
But one American man did not seem all that excited about wide-scale testing: President Trump.The president expressed reluctance to wait for comprehensive national testing before reopening the country for business and social life again. While he boasted that testing has increased drastically in recent days, he said it would be implausible to expect that the whole country could be screened for the virus as a condition of restoring normal life.
“Do you need it? No,” he said at his daily briefing. “Is it nice? Yes. We’re talking 325 million people. That’s not going to happen, as you can imagine.”
Even though more than 1,000 people are now dying every day in the United States, new infections have slowed in places where stringent measures have been in place for more than two weeks, offering some hope.
OPEC and Russia reach a deal to cut oil production amid lower demand.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and others including Russia on Thursday reached an agreement to temporarily cut large volumes of production, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.
OPEC and the other oil-producing countries agreed to cut about 10 million barrels a day, or about 10 percent from normal production levels, in May and June, said this person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement had not been made official.
Possible further trims could come from a meeting of the Group of 20 nations on Friday.The Saudis have been engaged in a price war with Russia after Moscow refused to go along with a Saudi proposal in early March to trim output to deal with the effects of the pandemic. The spat threatened to swamp oil markets with vast oversupplies of crude.
Still, crude oil prices fell sharply on Thursday afternoon, in part because the production cuts were not expected to offset the fact that slowing economies and virus-related shutdowns have dampened demand for oil.
Stocks rose on Thursday after the Federal Reserve announced an expansion of its emergency lending powers in another bid to backstop the U.S. economy, but the gains faded in the afternoon after oil prices fell and shares of energy companies followed.
Still, the S&P 500 rose about 1.5 percent, bringing its gains this week to 12 percent. Markets in the U.S. are closed on Friday, ahead of Easter.
New York State and Pennsylvania set single-day records.
The number of patients hospitalized with the virus in New York State on Wednesday rose by only 200 from the previous day, the governor said Thursday, the smallest increase since before the statewide lockdown, even as he announced that 799 more people — another bleak record — had died.
The state’s fatality count increased to 7,067. For the second consecutive day, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo compared the toll of the virus to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, calling the outbreak a “silent explosion that ripples through society with the same randomness, the same evil that we saw on 9/11.”
Although the governor said that some data, like the shrinking number of hospital admissions, suggested that New York was making headway, he warned against relaxing compliance with restrictions.
“The moment you stop following the policies, you will go right back and see that number shoot through the roof,” Mr. Cuomo.
At the same time, other New York officials have begun to cautiously envision an eventual return to some normalcy.
With transmission still widespread, Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York said Thursday that he thought the city could move as early as mid-May to the next stage: one with low-level spread of the virus, in which cases could be more easily traced.
“We can say that it’s time to start planning for the next phase very overtly,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference.
Gov. Phil Murphy of New Jersey on Thursday cited progress in the fight against the virus, even as he reported that another 198 people in the state had died.
In Pennsylvania, health officials on Thursday announced 1,989 new cases for a total of 18,228, the largest single-day jump so far. The number of cases in the state has doubled in a week, up from around 7,000 on April 2. The number of known deaths has also surged more than threefold in the same period, to 338 from 90.
At a White House briefing on Wednesday night, Vice President Mike Pence said Philadelphia had emerged as “an area of particular concern,” though local officials have pushed back against characterizing the city as a hot spot.
The outbreak spreads to the South, ‘a uniquely vulnerable population.’
With the virus spreading quickly across the South and expected to peak there in the next few weeks, public health experts said they were especially concerned about the toll it might take on an already vulnerable and at-risk population.
In the South, particularly in rural areas, dozens of hospitals have shuttered over the last decade. There are fewer insurance options for the poor, and the region has entrenched poverty and health issues, including high rates of diabetes and other ailments that worsen the effects of Covid-19.
Six of the nation’s poorest states are in the South, and the region is home to seven of the 10 unhealthiest states, according to the latest annual ranking by the United Health Foundation, which takes into account a mix of public health policy, environmental conditions and behaviors.
“I really don’t think we can say strongly enough that we are a uniquely vulnerable population here,” Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, the director of the Division of Infectious Diseases at the University of Alabama in Birmingham, said in a recent briefing. 
Critics said governors who delayed issuing orders to keep residents at home created a disadvantage in confronting the pandemic. All but one of the southern states has since announced shelter-in-place orders, with Arkansas the lone holdout.
California’s governor defends his decision to send ventilators to other states.
California’s decision to ship hundreds of ventilators to other states this week has been met with alarm by some local officials, who expressed concern about a shortage.
Earlier this week, workers packed the equipment for heavily hit states like New York and New Jersey and wrote messages of support on the boxes. “Prayers from the West Coast,” one read. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said a total of 500 ventilators would be split among Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, New York, Nevada, New Jersey and Washington, D.C. He described the shipments as a loan.
But in places like Riverside County, east of Los Angeles, officials expressed concern about a “fragile” supply chain. Hospitals there were anxiously preparing for a shortage in ventilators, they said.
Riverside County has been among the hardest hit in California, with more than 1,100 cases, at least 32 deaths and an outbreak at a nursing home that forced evacuations this week after a beleaguered and sickened staff failed to show up two days in a row.
County officials said this week that the state had denied its request for ventilators, and that a second one was pending.
At his daily news briefing on Thursday, Mr. Newsom sought to allay those concerns and pushed back against the idea that the state was neglecting its own needs, although he did not name Riverside or Santa Clara Counties.
“It was the right thing to do, and it was the responsible thing to do as Americans,” he said. “We can’t just sit on assets when we could save lives in other states.”
Mr. Newsom also said he was encouraged by — but not drawing too many conclusions from — the state’s first drop in the number of coronavirus patients who were being treated in intensive care units.
He said there were 1,132 people receiving intensive care as of Thursday, a 1.9 percent decrease from the day before.
“One data point is not a trend,” he warned. “One data point is not a headline, so I caution anybody to read too much into that one point of data, but nonetheless it is encouraging and it just again reinforces the incredible work that all of you are doing.”
The modeling curve of coronavirus cases, he said, had been “bent” by the efforts of Californians who have been following suggested practices like staying indoors, avoiding other people and washing their hands.
A Louisiana lawmaker becomes the latest state legislator to die from the virus.A Louisiana state representative died this week from the coronavirus, according to his son, the latest sign that the pandemic is making incursions into the nation’s state legislatures.
The representative, Reggie Paul Bagala, was elected last year to represent Jefferson and Lafourche Parishes.
Mr. Bagala, a conservative businessman who also worked in local government, had been on a ventilator at Ochsner St. Anne Hospital in Raceland, La., according to his son, Tristan Paul Bagala, who had chronicled his father’s battle with the virus on Facebook. He was 54, according to Nola.com.
Mr. Bagala was at least the second state lawmaker nationwide to die of the virus. On April 3, Bob Glanzer, a Republican state representative from South Dakota, died at Avera McKennan Hospital & University Health Center in Sioux Falls. He was 74 and had served in the South Dakota House of Representatives since 2017, according to Gov. Kristi Noem.
Late last month, Isaac Robinson, a first-term Democratic state representative from Michigan, died at 44. A lawyer who had worked in the labor movement, he represented Hamtramck and parts of Detroit.
Mr. Robinson’s mother, Rose Mary C. Robinson, who was herself a former state representative, told The Associated Press that although no cause was given for her son’s death, she suspected he died of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. She said he had not been tested for the virus, but had been taken to the hospital for breathing problems.
Cruise ship passengers outside Miami face a 14-day quarantine at sea.
Thirteen cruise ship passengers who have been on board the Coral Princess for more than a month will have to spend two weeks in quarantine at sea with the crew, because travel restrictions in their countries of origin prevent them from going home, the cruise line said Thursday.
The authorities in Miami, where the ship has been docked since Saturday, have not allowed the passengers to stay in local hotels, the company said.
The Coral Princess, a ship owned by the Carnival Corporation, arrived in Florida last week with more than 1,000 passengers on board — two of them dead and at least a dozen with positive tests for the coronavirus. A third passenger waited hours on the dock for an ambulance and later died in a Miami hospital.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention required the cruise company to arrange charter flights to get passengers home. But four countries that have closed their borders to stop the spread of the coronavirus — Colombia, Ecuador, Russia and Serbia — would not accept the passengers, even though they are their own citizens.
After everyone else evacuated the ship over the past four days, the remaining guests were to join the crew and depart Thursday night for a 14-day quarantine at sea.
On Thursday night, the C.D.C. modified and extended its so-called No Sail Order for cruise ships in ways that appeared to bring the industry to a halt in United States ports. 
The order, the C.D.C. said, “ceases operations of cruise ships in waters in which the United States may exert jurisdiction” and requires them to develop a detailed, government-approved plan to monitor and address the pandemic’s effect on their operations. Operators are not allowed to disembark passengers or crew members at American ports, or return crew members to ships, without government approval “until further notice.”
European officials agree to spend more than a half-trillion euros on economic relief.
European Union finance ministers on Thursday agreed to the outlines of a loan package worth more than half a trillion euros to help the bloc’s nations relieve the severe economic blow from the pandemic.
The measures, which must be approved by the bloc’s leaders, could total up to €540 billion, or $590 billion, a show of solidarity as the economic and health crisis brought on by the virus strains bonds among the member countries.
The agreement includes €100 billion to fund unemployment benefits, €200 billion for loans to smaller businesses, and up to €240 billion lent by the Eurozone’s bailout fund to member states, to cover potentially crippling health care-related costs.
Some details, most notably on the terms and conditions of loans to countries from the bailout fund, were still unclear and could prove contentious. Countries like Italy that are likely to tap those loans want to ensure they don’t come with austerity conditions attached.
The ministers did not agree to issue bonds backed by the entire bloc, which had come to be known as “coronabonds,” in a defeat for Italy and Spain, the two worst-hit countries. Germany, the Netherlands and other richer northern European countries had staunchly opposed joint debt issuance.
In the race for virus drugs, a scientist on the front lines is urging caution. 
Insistent calls and emails pile up each day for Dr. Andre Kalil at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Patients and their doctors are clamoring for untested virus treatments, encouraged by President Trump, who said that ill patients should have ready access to experimental medicines, like the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine.
Dr. Kalil, 54, is a principal investigator in the federal government’s clinical trial of drugs that may treat the virus. It is starting with remdesivir, an antiviral drug. The first results will be ready within weeks.
Dr. Kalil has decades of experience grappling with questions about the use — and misuse — of experimental drugs, and he has rarely been more frustrated. He has seen what happens when desperation drives treatment decisions. “Many drugs we believed were fantastic ended up killing people,” he said in an interview. “It is so hard to keep explaining that.”
Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, Dr. Kalil said, have never been found to work against any viral disease, including Ebola. (Malaria is caused by a parasite, not a virus.) And the drugs have side effects, some of which could be fatal.
The virus is sickening and killing low-wage workers in meat plants.
The virus has reached the processing plants where thousands of workers typically stand elbow-to-elbow to do the low-wage work of cutting, deboning and packing the chicken and beef that Americans savor. 
Some plants have offered financial incentives to keep workers on the job, but the virus’s swift spread is causing illness and forcing plants to close.
Smithfield Foods’ pork plant in Sioux Falls, S.D., announced on Thursday that it would close temporarily, after more than 80 workers tested positive. Workers have come down with the disease in several poultry plants in the South, including in Alabama, Georgia and Tennessee.
JBS, the world’s largest meat processor, confirmed the death of one worker at a Colorado facility and shuttered a Pennsylvania plant for two weeks. Cargill this week closed a Pennsylvania facility that produces steaks, ground beef and ground pork. Tyson Foods halted operations at an Iowa pork plant after more than two dozen workers tested positive.
“How many more have to fight for their life, how many more families got to suffer before they realize we are more important than their production,” asked Tanisha Isom, 36, a deboner at a Tyson poultry plant in Camilla, Ga., where three workers have died in recent days. She recently learned she had bronchitis and missed two weeks of work.
At some plants, workers have staged walkouts over concerns that they are not being properly protected. Industry analysts said the plant closures were unlikely to result in serious disruptions to the food supply. 
The White House gave virus tests to reporters.The White House for the first time conducted rapid coronavirus tests Thursday on all journalists attending the daily briefing led by President Trump after a reporter who was in the building earlier this week fell ill.
Journalists were tested one by one in a vacant office, with results delivered before the briefing. Last week White House doctors began administering rapid tests to others who came into “close proximity” to Mr. Trump or Vice President Mike Pence, but this was the first time that journalists have been tested.
An unidentified news organization employee who was at the White House as recently as Tuesday has reported experiencing symptoms consistent with the coronavirus and is expected to have test results back later on Thursday.
Also on Thursday, Melania Trump, the first lady, posted a video on Twitter advising Americans to wear face coverings in public, echoing public health recommendations that Mr. Trump has personally eschewed.
Nurses and doctors who speak out about the risks they face also risk their jobs.
Workers as varied as grocery store cashiers, customer service representatives and flight attendants have clashed with their employers, whom they accuse of failing to protect and properly value them. Amazon drew widespread attention when it fired a worker who had led a protest over health concerns at a Staten Island warehouse.
But perhaps the most curious and persistent management-labor tension has arisen among health care providers like doctors and nurses, who are at the forefront of the virus battle, and their administrators.
In New York City, the center of the crisis in the United States, every major private hospital system and some public hospitals in recent weeks sent memos ordering workers not to speak to the news media.
One system, NYU Langone Medical Center, sent an email on March 27 warning that staff members who spoke to the news media without permission would be “subject to disciplinary action, including termination.” The email was reported earlier by Bloomberg.
Similar lines are being drawn nationwide. A doctor in Washington State was removed from his hospital position after speaking publicly about a shortage of protective equipment and testing; the staffing firm that employed him said he was being reassigned. Nurses in Detroit recently walked off the job to protest critically low staffing after a colleague who had spoken up on the issue was fired.
The first crew member from the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt is hospitalized because of virus.
A sailor stricken with the virus and assigned to the aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt has been admitted to an intensive care unit at a Navy hospital in Guam, a Defense Department official said, marking the first hospitalization of a crew member since an outbreak began aboard the ship last month.
At least 286 members of the crew have tested positive for the virus.“The sailor tested positive for Covid-19 on March 30 and at the time of hospitalization was in a 14-day isolation period on Naval Base Guam,” Cmdr. Clayton Doss, a Navy spokesman, said in an email.
The outbreak aboard the Roosevelt has been, in many ways, a microcosm of the Defense Department’s handling of the virus within its ranks as military officials have weighed military preparedness with the health of its personnel.
The ship’s commanding officer, Capt. Brett E. Crozier, was relieved after he wrote a strongly worded letter to Navy officials pleading for more help aboard the carrier. The fallout from the episode led to the resignation of Thomas B. Modly, the acting Navy secretary, this week.
Inmates test positive, setting off a protest in a Washington State prison.
Police officers fired pepper spray and “sting balls” filled with rubber pellets to quell a protest of more than 100 inmates at a state prison in Monroe, Wash., on Wednesday evening after six prisoners tested positive for the coronavirus.
Prisoners in the minimum-security unit, where the men had tested positive, set off fire extinguishers to create the appearance of smoke and then refused to leave the recreation yard, according to a statement from the state’s Corrections Department. The protest ended without injuries, but prisoner movement at the facility, which holds about 450 inmates, was restricted.
The chaos came as the nation’s jails and prisons, where prisoners often live just feet apart, faced urgent reckonings over the virus and whether they could adequately protect inmates. Some prisoners have staged hunger strikes, and the courts have been considering lawsuits seeking the release of vulnerable inmates across the country.
As of Wednesday, The New York Times had identified at least 1,324 confirmed coronavirus cases tied to U.S. prisons and jails, including at least 32 deaths. Those numbers are most likely a vast undercount, because some state and local agencies have not released information, and others, including the federal Bureau of Prisons, are not testing everyone who falls ill.
According to Times data, the Cook County Jail in Chicago is the largest-known source of infection in the United States. As of Thursday morning, at least 401 inmates and employees had tested positive for the virus.
Texas man is accused of falsely claiming to have paid someone to spread the virus.
A San Antonio man who became upset that so many people were crowding into grocery stores took his frustration to a criminal extreme and made an untrue claim on Facebook that he had paid someone to spread the illness, the authorities have said.
The man, Christopher Charles Perez, 39, made the false claim in the hope that it would deter shoppers from visiting the stores, and in that way keep them from spreading the contagion, according to a federal complaint.
San Antonio has been contending with a surge of infections and deaths.An outbreak at the Southeast Nursing and Rehabilitation Center has claimed at least 10 lives. Four San Antonio police officers have tested positive. And as hotel-occupancy tax revenues decline, officials said on Wednesday that about 270 city employees would be furloughed on April 23.
An anonymous tipster sent a screenshot of Mr. Perez’s Facebook post on Sunday to law enforcement, officials said in a statement on Wednesday. In the post, Mr. Perez warned a grocery store chain that his “homeboys cousin has Covid-19 and has licked every thing for past 2 days cause we paid him too,” according to court documents. Mr. Perez was arrested on Tuesday.
“To be clear, the alleged threat was false,” the office of John F. Bash, the United States Attorney for the Western District of Texas, said. “No one spread coronavirus at grocery stores, according to investigators.”

The S&P 500 is up 23 percent from its March low.Wall Street resumed its rally on Wednesday. With a more than 3 percent gain, the S&P 500 is now up about 23 percent from its March 23 low.
The market has been steadily climbing since it hit that bottom, a rebound that began after the Federal Reserve and lawmakers in Washington took steps to protect the U.S. economy from a collapse amid the coronavirus pandemic. Stocks are still down about 19 percent from their late February high.
More recently, the gains have reflected hope that the peak of the pandemic in many cities is near, or already past. The growth rate of hospitalizations in hot spots like New York is slowing; China has lifted its lockdown of Wuhan, the city where the virus emerged; and governments in parts of Europe are making plans to do the same.
To some extent, the recent gains also reflect Wall Street’s fear of missing out on the rebound that many analysts predicted would eventually come.
“If you wait until the coast is clear, you will have missed a huge part of the gains,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak a trading and asset management firm. “And professional investors can’t afford to do that.”
For now, though, it is big money managers — not mom-and-pop retail investors — who are in on the action. Hedge fund traders and mutual fund managers have swooped into the market, driving sharp gains for blue-chip shares that have been battered by the market sell-off.
Still, the market’s recent optimism is set against a grim backdrop of economic and human catastrophe that continues to play out — and which threatens to undercut any rally at a moment’s notice.
In Europe, data released on Wednesday showed that Germany and France, the largest economies in the region, were heading toward their sharpest downturns since World War II. 
There’s more data to come. A new report on weekly jobless claims on Thursday is certain to show millions more Americans are out of work. The two prior reports recorded more than 10 million claims for unemployment in late March.
Investors go shopping: “We will never get these prices again.”
After a 3.4 percent rise on Wednesday, the S&P 500 has bounced 23 percent from its low in a disastrous March, despite a darkening outlook for economic growth and corporate profits.
One reason: It’s the time to buy for investors able to stomach the market’s swoons.Cole Smead, a portfolio manager at the Smead Value Fund, has been snapping up bargains in beaten-up parts of the market, like oil and energy producers, homebuilders and shopping-mall companies, that are closely tied to short-term swings in the economy.
“We will never get these prices again,” said Mr. Smead, whose fund has $1.3 billion in assets.As economically damaging as the pandemic will no doubt be, Wall Street is starting to see a path forward that wasn’t clear a few weeks ago. Slowing infection rates, hefty government relief packages and the Federal Reserve’s efforts to calm the markets have helped eased investors’ minds.
Some of the buyers are opportunistic hedge fund traders and mutual fund managers, driving sharp gains for blue-chip shares that were battered by the market sell-off. Some are traders feeling pressure to get into a rising market. And some are short-sellers forced to buy to minimize their own losses.
But mom-and-pop investors have largely been sitting out — a sign that the rally doesn’t reflect widespread optimism.
WeWork skips rent payments as it seeks to renegotiate better deals.
WeWork has not made scheduled rent payments to the landlords of some of the buildings where it operates its co-working spaces, according to a person briefed on the situation.
The decision to hold back rent is part of WeWork’s efforts to renegotiate better deals with building owners as the company tries to cut costs and limit its losses. WeWork’s executive chairman, Marcelo Claure, said in December that the company would try to get better terms from landlords, but the economic swoon caused by the coronavirus pandemic has made the task more urgent.
“Rather than implementing a company-wide policy on rent payments, we are individually reaching out to our more than 600 global landlord partners to work in good faith towards finding asset-specific solutions that benefit all parties involved,” WeWork said in a statement.
The person briefed on the situation said WeWork was seeking to renegotiate leases around the world, not just in the United States.
The Wall Street Journal first reported that WeWork was skipping rent payments.The virus outbreak has emptied many of WeWork’s locations and may reduce demand for its space over the longer terms. Seeing the empty spaces, landlords might be persuaded to reduce WeWork’s lease payments, but they also know that SoftBank, the company’s dominant shareholder, committed billions of dollars to finance WeWork’s expansion.
With hospitals in dire straits, insurance companies are speeding up payments.In a sign of just how desperate hospitals and doctors are for cash during the coronavirus pandemic, insurance companies, notorious for slow-walking their payments to health care providers, are now speeding up how quickly they pay.
“There was a universal cry for cash,” said Paul Markovich, the chief executive of Blue Shield of California, which said it would advance up to $200 million in payments to hospitals and doctors.
With revenues down for surgeries and other care not viewed as essential, providers are scrambling for money to pay for protective equipment and other supplies. “The pressure on the entire health care ecosystem is something I’ve never seen before,’‘ said Mr. Markovich, who hopes to get out the first payments as soon as this week.
“We’re effectively advancing payment now and collecting later,” he said, even as it is also working with customers about letting them delay paying premiums.
UnitedHealth, which owns one of the nation’s largest insurance companies, said it would also take a series of steps, like waiving the need for pre-authorization when patients see a new doctor or go to a skilled nursing facility, that should result in nearly $2 billion in payments getting in the hands of providers more quickly. Providers could be paid in a matter of days rather than several weeks.
United also announced it would be making $125 million available in small-business loans to medical groups that work with its Optum unit, which provides consulting and other services.
Highmark, a Blue Cross plan in Pittsburgh, said it was advancing more than $30 million to primary care doctors, who have been particularly hard hit as many patients have decided to forgo face-to-face doctors’ visits.
Another way to see the recession: Power usage is way down.New data on electricity use suggest that U.S. economic activity probably declined more over the past three weeks than it did during the entire year and a half of the Great Recession. It may already be the deepest downturn since the Great Depression; it is certainly the fastest.
These numbers are important because our official statistics cannot keep pace with the abrupt economic changes the coronavirus shutdown has caused. All those closed stores, silenced factories and darkened office buildings are yet to be counted in the government’s official economic numbers, which take months to collect, process and report.
But evidence of the sharp economic shift shows up in a large and rapid decline in electricity usage over recent weeks.
Food banks are squeezed by rising hunger and dwindling resources.
Demand for food assistance in the United States is surging, as millions of Americans find themselves out of work and school closures mean that many families who counted on them for free or subsidized meals need to turn elsewhere.
The rise in need is coming just as food banks face shortages of both donated food and volunteer workers.
It’s a nationwide phenomena:At Food Bank for the Heartland in Omaha, the amount of food donated for March dropped by nearly half. The food bank typically purchases $73,000 of food in a month this time of year but has spent $675,000 in the past four weeks.In Jonesboro, Ark., after a powerful tornado struck, a food bank received less than half the donations it expected because nervous families held on to what they had.In Washington State and Louisiana, the National Guard has been called in to help pack food boxes and ensure that the distributions run smoothly.Feeding America, the nation’s largest network of food banks, with more than 200 affiliates, has projected a $1.4 billion shortfall in the next six months alone.“I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Stacy Dean, vice president for food assistance policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning research organization in Washington. She has studied food security for more than a quarter century. “People love the phrase ‘the perfect storm,’” she added, “but nothing is built for this.”
Europe’s biggest economies brace for the sharpest drop since World War II.
Europe’s pandemic-induced lockdowns were widely expected to throw the continent into a deep recession. Germany and France, the largest economies, said on Wednesday that they were headed toward their sharpest downturns since World War II, a warning that showed just how bad it’s about to get.
France officially slid into a recession after suffering one of the worst quarterly contractions in more than 50 years. Growth tumbled an estimated 6 percent from January to April, from the fourth quarter, the central bank said. For every two weeks the population remains under confinement, the economy shrinks by at least 1.5 percent, it added.
And Germany is sliding toward its deepest recession on record, with growth expected to plunge almost 10 percent from April through June, five leading economic institutes said Tuesday.
Here’s what you need to know about coronavirus relief for small business.The federal stimulus bills enacted in March, including a $2 trillion economic relief plan, offer help for the millions of American small businesses affected by the coronavirus pandemic.
Cash grants. Low-interest loans. Payments to offset some payroll costs for businesses that keep or rehire workers. There are also enhancements to unemployment insurance and paid leave.
Here are the answers to common questions about these programs. If you have questions, or have applied for small business aid and can tell us how the process went, we’d love to hear from you.

Catch up: Here’s what else is happening.The used-car retailer CarMax said on its website on Wednesday that it would furlough 15,500 employees, effective April 18. The company’s president and chief executive, Bill Nash, will forgo half of his salary, and the company’s senior leadership will take an unspecified reduction in pay.The Walt Disney Company has been badly battered by the pandemic, with its theme parks closed and movies postponed, but the company on Wednesday offered an upbeat update on its nascent streaming service: Disney Plus has passed 50 million paid subscribers worldwide in just five months of operation. Before its November introduction, analysts had predicted that Disney Plus would take a full year to sign up half that many subscribers. A hit series, “The Mandalorian,” has greatly increased demand. The pandemic has likely also helped, with parents looking for ways to entertain homebound children.Nordstrom, one of the country’s best-performing department stores, said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it did not have a “firm date” on when its stores would reopen. Most of the company’s work force — about 69,000 people, according to a separate filing — has been furloughed “or assigned zero hours of work.” Nordstrom has also temporarily closed its headquarters in Seattle.Amazon said it planned to pause a pilot program that shipped products for sellers on its marketplace in a bid to ease the pressures on its logistics operations, which are stretched thin by the surge in online shopping. The program, called Amazon Shipping, picked up packages that were already packed and labeled from a seller’s warehouse and then delivered them using Amazon’s delivery network. It competed with U.P.S. and FedEx’s ground service.Airbus, the European aerospace giant, said it was cutting production by about a third in response to the reshaping of the aircraft market. “Our airline customers are heavily impacted by the COVID-19 crisis,” Guillaume Faury, Airbus’s chief executive, said in a statement. “We are actively adapting our production to their new situation.”The London-based Jewish Chronicle, one of the oldest Jewish newspapers in the world, said on Wednesday that it would cease publication after being crushed by the financial impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Founded in 1841, The Chronicle claims to be the oldest continuously published Jewish paper in the world.Reporting was contributed by Peter Eavis, Reed Abelson, Jeanna Smialek, Emily Flitter, Ana Swanson, Stacy Cowley, Karen Weise, Noam Scheiber, Liz Alderman, Jack Ewing, Sapna Maheshwari, Conor Dougherty, Niraj Chokshi, Adam Satariano, Choe Sang-Hun, Jack Nicas, Ceylan Yeginsu, Austin Ramzy, Mohammed Hadi, Matt Phillips, Katie Robertson, Carlos Tejada and Amie Tsang."
53,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/20/technology/new-york-ventilators-coronavirus.html,The New York Times,2020-04-20,['Steve Lohr'],New York Needed Ventilators. So They Developed One in a Month.,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/17/business/17virus-vent1/17virus-vent1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
This article is part of our continuing Fast Forward series, which examines technological, economic, social and cultural shifts that happen as businesses evolve.
The nudge came in an email in early March from an Italian friend alarmed by how fast the deadly coronavirus was spreading in his country.
A shortage of ventilators, he told Scott Cohen and Marcel Botha, was a critical problem in Italy, and he warned that it soon would be in the United States, too. He urged the pair to apply their skills to the ventilator challenge.
Both Mr. Cohen, co-founder of a technology center for researchers and start-ups, and Mr. Botha, chief executive of a product design and development company, were skeptical. A standard ventilator, with thousands of parts requiring a complex global supply chain, was hardly a device that could be manufactured quickly and affordably.
“I was dismissive at first,” said Mr. Botha, whose company is called 10XBeta. “It looked impossible.”
But they soon found a design for a basic ventilator that could serve as their core technology. Since then, they have orchestrated from New York a far-flung collaboration of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, physicians and regulatory experts and accomplished in a month what would normally take a year or more.
The result are machines known as “bridge” ventilators, or automatic resuscitators, priced at $3,300. They are mainly meant to help less critically ill patients breathe. If patients become sicker, with lung function more compromised by the disease, they still need to be placed on standard ventilators, which typically cost more than $30,000.
On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration approved the new device, the Spiro Wave, to be used on patients in hospitals, under an expedited process called emergency use authorization.
The project was initially targeted at New York City as a stopgap solution for what only a month ago appeared to be a looming, life-threatening shortage of ventilators in the city.
But the urgency has receded for now. While the city’s coronavirus death toll continues to mount, hospital admissions are trending down, and intensive-care units seem to have enough ventilators.
But health experts say a machine like the Spiro Wave should be a valuable tool in the arsenal of treatment. It can, they say, expand access to breathing assistance in other parts of the country as the pandemic spreads, and especially to rural communities without major medical centers. And capable, low-cost machines could greatly expand access to treatment in developing countries in Asia, Africa and Latin America.
The New York group has fielded inquiries from across the United States and from companies and governments worldwide. It plans to license its design for free.
The project is one of several pushes in America and abroad to streamline ventilator design and lower costs. This month, Medtronic got F.D.A. approval to offer in the United States a ventilator that it sells in 35 other countries for an average price of less than $10,000. The company is also making the machine’s blueprint freely available to other manufacturers.
The hurry-up engineering feat relied on human networks; two in particular stand out. The original design came from a classroom project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology a decade ago. Since the coronavirus outbreak, M.I.T. professors and students have worked to upgrade the design in collaboration with outside groups. And several key contributors to the project are M.I.T. alumni.
The other network is the government and business community of New York, where Mr. Cohen and Mr. Botha are based. The city government took on the role of a risk-taking venture investor, first with a $100,000 research grant and then a nearly $10 million agreement to buy 3,000 of the basic ventilators.
“It’s essentially a start-up that has made unbelievable progress in a short time,” said James Patchett, chief executive of New York City’s Economic Development Corporation, which backed the project.
The New York ventilator effort got underway after widespread warnings of shortages. In mid-March, Mayor Bill de Blasio held a conference call with top staff members. Mr. de Blasio recalled that the looming ventilator shortage was “scary as hell.” New York had no ventilator producers, but he told his staff to do and spend what it took to solve the problem.
The city’s economic development chief, Mr. Patchett, who was on the call, knew Mr. Cohen and his technology center, New Lab, which is in the Brooklyn Navy Yard. Mr. Cohen told him about the ventilator-design project that he was putting together. It sounded promising, and the city made its initial grant.
Later, on March 25, after further development of the M.I.T. design, critical care physicians from city’s public hospitals and two private hospitals saw the most recent version of the machine. That evening Mr. Patchett called Dr. Mitchell Katz, who leads the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which operates the city’s public hospitals.
“We should definitely do this,” Dr. Katz recalled telling Mr. Patchett.The project had launched about 10 days earlier, after Mr. Cohen, on the recommendation of a scientist friend in San Francisco, got in touch with Alex Slocum, a renowned mechanical engineer at M.I.T. whose class created the design in 2010.
A group of faculty and students — Mr. Slocum led hardware design, and Daniela Rus, a professor and robotics expert, led software development — worked to upgrade the design to help coronavirus patients. The device would have to be able to push air into badly impaired lungs at several times the force used to resuscitate a normal lung.
“This was going to take a serious machine,” Mr. Slocum recalled.The New York group began closely collaborating with the M.I.T. team. Dr. Albert Kwon, an M.I.T. graduate and a medical adviser on the project who is an anesthesiologist at the Westchester Medical Center, and Mr. Botha, also an M.I.T. alumnus, and others from New York made several trips to Boston for joint work and testing.
The M.I.T. academics’ goal has been mainly to develop designs and share information on a website. But the mission for the New York group was to make the low-cost ventilators quickly. The hub of that effort is a former perfume factory in Long Island City, Queens, that is now home to a high-tech manufacturer, Boyce Technologies.
The temperature of everyone who enters the brick building is taken, a precaution against infection. The 100,000-square-foot facility combines engineering and production with robots, a clean room, and circuitry and software design departments.
Manufacturing, engineering and medical experts have worked side by side for three weeks. Dozens of versions of the machine have been carted off to the dumpster, as upgrades and improvements were made. In recent days, M.I.T. engineers traveled to Queens to help with last-minute software tweaks.
“There’s a lot you can’t see in a model,” said Charles Boyce, the founder and chief executive of Boyce Technologies. “And if you can’t manufacture something at scale, it doesn’t matter. It’s not going to have an impact.”
Producing thousands of machines means lining up sometimes scarce supplies. One of those parts was an air-pressure sensor to ensure that a patient’s lungs were not overinflated, which could cause damage. Mr. Cohen knew that Honeywell was a leading producer of the sensor, and he tapped his network of personal contacts to secure it in volume.
Late one night, Mr. Cohen called Kathryn Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City, a business group of the city’s top executives. Kevin Burke, a former chief executive of New York-based Con Edison, is a Honeywell board member. Introductions were made, and after a series of calls to Honeywell executives in America and Asia, a supply of the sensors was secured.
The New York ventilator project was intended to address a seemingly urgent need before large-scale initiatives — such as a Ford-General Electric partnership — began to produce ventilators.
While New York’s crisis has eased, Dr. Katz cautioned that pandemic viruses are unpredictable and mutate. A later variant, or second wave, in the fall could be less lethal or more, as was the case with the second wave of the 1918 flu pandemic.
“This is still a useful option to have, even if there is not the urgency there was,” he said.The low-cost ventilator, Mayor de Blasio said, is an “invaluable tool” and part of the stockpile of medical equipment and supplies the city needs as “insurance against a Phase 2” of the pandemic.
“We have to get through this first,” he said. “But for the future, we have to have an ongoing self-sufficiency effort in New York. What we’ve gone through should be a never-again moment.”"

Ford Motor and General Electric will produce 50,000 ventilators.Ford Motor and General Electric’s health care division said on Monday that they together planned to produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days to help meet the needs of hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic.
Ford plans to continue making about 30,000 ventilators a month once the initial batch has been made. Ford will use a plant in Rawsonville, Mich., and about 500 workers to make the medical devices.
Ford’s effort is the second-such initiative by a major automaker. General Motors has said it plans to make ventilators at one of its factories in Kokomo, Ind., with Ventec Life Systems, a ventilator manufacturer. Tesla, the electric car company, has also said that it intends to make ventilators with Medtronic at a factory in Buffalo.
G.E. has licensed the design of the ventilator from Airon Corporation of Melbourne, Fla. The device works on air pressure and does not need electricity, and the companies said it could be useful for most coronavirus patients who need help breathing.
Ford and G.E. said last week that Ford would help increase production of another ventilator based on a design from G.E. Healthcare.
Stocks climb but investor unease continues.Stocks on Wall Street rose on Monday as investors bid up shares of health care companies as they reported progress on products that could help with the coronavirus outbreak.
The S&P 500 climbed more than 3 percent, adding to a strong showing last week. The S&P 500 had risen 10 percent last week after a three-day run that was its best since 1933, amid relief over Washington’s $2 trillion spending plan.
Gainers on Monday included Johnson & Johnson, which said it had identified a lead candidate for a vaccine for the virus and planned to ramp up both production and clinical testing. Abbott Laboratories rose on reports that it had said a new test that could detect the virus in five minutes had been cleared for use by the Food and Drug Administration.
But there were lingering signs of caution in the financial markets. Most notably, oil prices tumbled to their lowest levels since 2002.
And in the stock market, Monday’s rally came on relatively light volume, said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak, a trading and asset management firm. That suggests a lack of conviction among investors, he said.
“It’s a little bit of lack of confidence,” said Mr. Maley, “And you can’t blame them after what’s happened.”
Some industries continued to be battered by the long shadow of the virus. Cruise lines Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and Carnival were all down 10 percent, making them some of the worst performers in the S&P 500 on Monday. United Airlines, American Airlines and Boeing, all of which had rallied last week on expectations that they would benefit from government assistance, also fell sharply.
The dizzying moves that characterized trading in financial markets for most of March seem to have ended as policymakers around the world moved to bolster their economies with spending and other means of support. But investors were weighing those efforts against the rising number of coronavirus cases and the redoubled efforts to contain the pandemic.
President Trump on Sunday extended guidelines on social distancing and nonessential travel in the United States, an admission that there is no certainty around when the spreading coronavirus epidemic will end.
In the oil market, brent crude, the international benchmark, fell more than 6 percent to roughly $26 a barrel on Monday. West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark, was down more than 5 percent with prices hovering around $20.25 in early afternoon trading. Earlier in the morning the price had briefly dropped below $20 a barrel, a level not seen in almost 20 years.
Oil has also been hammered by a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia, two of the largest oil producers, but analysts say that it is far outweighed by the collapse in demand caused by the pandemic.
FGE, a consulting firm, recently estimated that demand for April would fall by 17 million barrels a day — to about 17 percent lower than usual — as airplanes are grounded, road traffic falls sharply and factories are shuttered.
Misleading coronavirus videos posted by Brazil’s president are pulled down.Facebook and Twitter took down posts featuring Brazil’s president, Jair Bolsonaro, over the past two days after he claimed that the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine was a “cure everywhere” for the coronavirus and called for an end to social distancing and shelter-in-place measures in Brazil.
Mr. Bolsonaro had posted the videos, which showed him talking to street vendors in the Taguatinga district of Brasília, Brazil’s capital, to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram on Sunday. The New York Times has reported that there is no proof that the drug is effective against the virus.
Twitter took down the videos on Sunday. The videos on Facebook and Instagram were taken down on Monday evening. The companies said the posts violated their policies for spreading misinformation that could also lead to physical harm.
But the moves were unusual for the tech companies, which have long been hesitant to remove posts from world leaders, even when they walk the line of disinformation. The companies have said posts from world leaders are newsworthy.
Twitter deleted a post by President Nicolás Maduro of Venezuela last week, in which Mr. Maduro promoted a “brew” that he claimed could cure coronavirus. President Trump has previously posted that hydroxychloroquine showed “tremendous promise,” which the social media companies said did not violate their policies because there was not a clear call to action that would cause the public any harm.
Macy’s has lost the ‘majority’ of its sales.
Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury, said on Monday that it had lost “the majority” of its sales because of store closures, which started March 18 and would persist until the retailer had a “clear line of sight on when it is safe to reopen.”
The company said it will furlough the majority of its employees this week and would maintain the “absolute minimum work force needed to maintain basic operations,” according to a statement. There will be fewer furloughs of employees supporting the digital business at call centers and distribution centers. Macy’s had 125,000 part-time and full-time employees at the end of last year.
The move shows the strain that the pandemic is placing on retailers selling goods that are considered nonessential. Many department stores and mall chains had already been weakened in recent years by the rise of e-commerce and a drop in foot traffic at malls. A complete closure of stores is dealing a new blow.
Macy’s said that it had already stopped capital spending and paying a dividend. It has also drawn down its line of credit and canceled some orders.
Retail workers have been affected across the board. L Brands, which owns Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, said it would furlough most store staff and “those who are not currently working to support the online businesses or who cannot work from home” starting April 5.
Gap, which also owns Old Navy and Banana Republic, said on Monday it would furlough nearly 80,000 store employees in the United States and Canada.
On Wednesday, April 1, many monthly bills will come due, and households and businesses across the nation will struggle to make their payments.
Residents won’t make rent, and small businesses will have to forgo lease payments. Even the multibillion-dollar Cheesecake Factory has told landlords not to expect an April check.
The trajectory of the U.S. economy largely depends on how many bills go unpaid. The money from the $2 trillion relief package that President Trump recently signed into law will be distributed too late to help many.
Homeowners will have to choose between rent or electricity. Businesses could start laying off workers.
“These are cascades that, once they get going, are very hard to stop,” said Claudia Sahm, head of macroeconomic policy for the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “You’re already seeing it.”
New York’s attorney general has questions for Zoom about privacy and security.Zoom, the popular videoconferencing app whose traffic has surged amid the coronavirus pandemic, is under scrutiny by the office of New York’s attorney general, Letitia James, for its data privacy and security practices.
The attorney general’s office sent a letter to Zoom on Monday asking what, if any, new security measures the company had put in place to handle increased traffic on its network and to detect hackers, according to a copy reviewed by The New York Times.
The letter referred to Zoom as “an essential and valuable communications platform,” but it outlined several concerns, noting that the company had been slow to address security flaws such as vulnerabilities that have allowed malicious users to invade videoconferences held on the service, a practice known as Zoombombing.
Instacart shoppers are staging a walkout over safety concerns.
In a sign of workers’ growing anxiety as the coronavirus pandemic rages, thousands of drivers and shoppers for the grocery delivery service Instacart walked off the job on Monday, demanding greater pay and better access to paid leave and cleaning material.
Though the size of the walkout was unclear, organizers said they believed that thousands of the company’s 200,000 shoppers, who work as independent contractors, were refusing to work. Their hope is to pressure the company by adding to the backlogs the service was already experiencing, as locked-down Americans have opted to get their daily staples delivered rather than venture out to stores.
The strike appeared to be having some effect on Monday. Ryan Hartson, an Instacart worker in Chicago, shared a screenshot from his Instacart app showing that many time slots were available for shoppers to pick up groceries, suggesting that the supply of workers was smaller than usual.
“Our team has had an unwavering commitment to prioritize the health and safety of the entire Instacart community,” Nilam Ganenthiran, president of Instacart, said in a statement. “We’ve been evaluating the Covid-19 crisis minute-by-minute to provide real-time support for Instacart shoppers and customers.”
As for Monday’s action, “we’ve seen absolutely no impact to Instacart’s operations,” a company spokeswoman said.
Catch up: Here’s what else is happening.American Airlines plans to apply for some of the $50 billion airline bailout included in the federal stimulus that was signed into law last week, its chief executive and president said in a memo to staff. The airline expects to receive $12 billion, some of which will be used to pay employees through September. The carrier also said it was offering leave, with partial pay, and early retirement to interested employees.See’s Candies, the California chocolatier, said in a statement on its website that it was halting production, just the second interruption in its 99-year history. (The first time was during World War II.) “In recognition of the guidance provided by local health authorities, See’s has suspended production and shipping of product,” the company said.Facebook announced Monday that it would give out $25 million in grants to local news organizations and spend $75 million in marketing that will go to news outlets internationally. Campbell Brown, a Facebook vice president, acknowledged in an interview that the company, whose huge chunk of online ad revenue helped dent media companies’ business models in the first place, felt a “responsibility” to help out.Reporting was contributed by Davey Alba, Sheera Frenkel, Kate Conger, Ernesto Londono, Danny Hakim, Natasha Singer, Matt Phillips, Stanley Reed, Kenneth P.

55,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/15/nyregion/coronavirus-face-masks-andrew-cuomo.html,The New York Times,2020-04-15,"['Luis Ferré-Sadurní, 'Maria Cramer']",New York Orders Residents to Wear Masks in Public,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/15/nyregion/15nyvirus-masks01/15nyvirus-masks01-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
Imposing a stricter measure to control the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said on Wednesday that he would start requiring people in New York to wear masks or face coverings in public whenever social distancing was not possible.
The order will take effect on Friday and will apply to people who are unable to keep six feet away from others in public settings, such as on a bus or subway, on a crowded sidewalk or inside a grocery store.
“Stopping the spread is everything,” Mr. Cuomo said during his daily briefing in Albany. “How can you not wear a mask when you’re going to come close to a person?”
The new requirements are bound to make face coverings an inescapable and perhaps jarring sight in New York City for the foreseeable future. They could also introduce a level of mutual obligation and civic duty about wearing masks in public that is more firmly established in Asia than in the West.
Maryland also announced on Wednesday that it would require people to wear masks in public.Mr. Cuomo said local governments would enforce the order, but he noted that riders without face coverings would not be ejected from public transit. The pandemic has devastated New York’s public transit system, with 59 workers having died of the virus and 2,269 testing positive for the infection.
The state would consider issuing civil penalties to people who fail to abide by the order, but not criminal penalties: “You’re not going to go to jail for not wearing a mask,” Mr. Cuomo said.
Permitted face coverings include proper masks, as well as scarves or bandannas, the governor said.A similar rule was issued in New Jersey last week. The order, issued by Gov. Philip D. Murphy, made it mandatory for all people inside stores and other essential businesses to wear face coverings unless they are under 2 years old or have a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a mask.
Signs have popped up at stores throughout New Jersey warning customers that they will not be allowed in unless they cover their faces. Some stores have taken a stronger stance, asking people without coverings to leave.
“These restrictions that I have laid out must be followed throughout the state,” Mr. Murphy said last week. “We are taking the step to protect both customers and essential workers.”
The mandates were the latest public safety measures from two states that are at the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States. New York and New Jersey have worked in tandem since the outbreak reached the region, shuttering nonessential businesses at the same time and recently forming a coalition with neighboring states to coordinate the reopening of their economies.
In announcing Maryland’s order on masks in public settings, Gov. Larry Hogan said, “The wearing of masks is something we may have to become more accustomed to in order to safely reopen our state.”
New York, New Jersey and Maryland are so far the only states to have issued broad orders mandating face coverings in most public settings, according to the most recent information from the National Governors Association. Puerto Rico and Guam have implemented similar measures.
Nonbinding guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention encourage people to wear face coverings in settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain to prevent the transmission of the virus. The infection spreads primarily through droplets generated when, for instance, a sick person coughs or sneezes.
That federal recommendation was issued after research showed that many people were infected with the virus but did not show symptoms.
Across New Jersey, businesses were still grappling with the enforcement of the new rules, which some people have flouted, leading to arrests in some instances.
Supermarkets have posted signs on their doors telling customers they cannot come in without a mask, but some shoppers have refused to wear coverings and laughed off the requirement, said Matt Fattah, the owner of a C-Town supermarket in Jersey City.
“A lot of people think they don’t have to follow the rules,” Mr. Fattah said. “My employees are all on board, wear masks and gloves 100 percent of the time. Customers, first few days, it was an issue. Like the bag ban, a lot of customers thought it was a joke, that we were joking.”
Earlier this week, the owners of a toy store in Lakewood, a town near the Jersey Shore, were charged with violating the order after police spotted about 10 people crowded inside the shop. Only three of them were wearing masks, according to the police.
And in Pleasantville, a town just west of Atlantic City, a 35-year-old man was arrested on several charges, including violating emergency orders, after he came into a Dunkin’ Donuts without a mask and refused to leave after employees asked him to.
Col. Patrick J. Callahan, superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, said the police would continue to cite and arrest those who ignored orders mandating social distancing and the wearing of masks.
“Because lives are at stake, enforcement action will be taken without hesitation against those who are blatantly placing the lives of others at risk,” he said in a statement.
Mr. Murphy, the New Jersey governor, said it was up to businesses to set their own policies on how to deal with customers who do not wear a face covering.
The state order does allow people who refuse to wear a mask for medical or other reasons to enter a store and spend a limited amount of time shopping for essential goods, Parimal Garg, the state’s deputy chief counsel, explained during Mr. Murphy’s briefing on April 8.
“I think that’s benevolent,” Mr. Murphy responded. “I’d prefer to even be tougher than that.”K.C. Rondello, a disaster epidemiologist at the College of Nursing and Public Health at Adelphi University in New York, said the mask requirement would ensure compliance from those who would otherwise ignore voluntary guidelines.
“If ultimately these laws lead to greater compliance with social distancing recommendations, then they will have a very real and quantifiable effect on morbidity and mortality,” he said. “It may be difficult for people to understand or appreciate the value of a face covering. They may think, ‘What could a bandanna possibly do?’ But it can make an enormous difference.”
In New York, Mr. Cuomo said the new measures were necessary as the state continued to rein in the spread of the virus: On Tuesday, the three-day average of the number of virus patients in hospitals — considered one of the most reliable measures of the virus’s impact — fell for the first time since the outbreak began.
“All people in public must have a mask or nose covering, mouth and nose covering, and they must wear it in a situation where you cannot or are not maintaining social distancing,” Mr. Cuomo said.
The governor said a mask was not necessary if, for example, a person was walking down an empty street. But, he said, “You’re now at an intersection and there are people at the intersection and you’re going to be in proximity to other people? Put the mask on.”
He added, “You don’t have a right to infect me.”Kevin Armstrong and Lauren Hard contributed reporting from New Jersey."

Tesla’s plans to reopen its California factory are not in compliance with a local health order.
Tesla has told employees it intended to restart its factory in Fremont, Calif., on Friday. But the electric car company’s plans do not comply with a local government order that has not yet cleared large manufacturers to resume operations.
The company informed employees of the plan in company emails that were reviewed by The New York Times. The emails were sent after Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said manufacturing companies could resume operations even as other businesses were to stay closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The governor also said that local governments could impose tougher restrictions than those that apply statewide.
A coalition of health officials from six counties in the San Francisco Bay Area and the City of Berkeley have chosen to maintain to stricter limits in their most recent order, issued on May 4.
That order allowed construction, landscaping, agricultural and other outdoor businesses to resume operations, but restaurants, bars or other indoor businesses “that do not permit physical distancing or have high-touch equipment” must remain closed.
“Tesla has been informed that they do not meet these criteria and must not reopen,” Neetu Balram, a spokeswoman for Alameda County, said in a statement.
Tesla representatives did not respond to a request for comment.April’s job losses highlight the depth of the pandemic’s devastation.
The Labor Department said Friday that the economy shed more than 20.5 million jobs in April, sending the unemployment rate to 14.7 percent — devastation unseen since the Great Depression.
The report underscores the speed and depth of the labor market’s collapse as the coronavirus pandemic took a devastating toll. In February, the unemployment rate was 3.5 percent, a half-century low.
The April job losses alone far exceed the 8.7 million in the last recession, when unemployment peaked at 10 percent in October 2009. The only comparable period came when the rate reached about 25 percent in 1933, before the government began publishing official statistics.
If anything, the report understates the damage. The government’s definition of unemployment typically requires people to be actively looking for work. And the unemployment rate does not reflect the millions still working who have had their hours slashed or their pay cut.
Women are embracing a natural appearance in lockdown.ImageSales of higher-end beauty products sold through department stores and retailers like Ulta Beauty and Sephora dropped about 14 percent in the first quarter.Credit...Taylor Johnson for The New York Times
The coronavirus shutdowns have upended many daily routines, including those around beauty, skin care and hair care.
Some people are taking matters into their own hands, sending sales of do-it-yourself hair color kits, hair trimmers and nail polish soaring at retailers like Walmart and Hy-Vee, a Midwest grocery store chain, in recent weeks.
But other people have simply stopped morning makeup regimens. For beauty companies and retailers, the combination of store closures and consumers who see little need to put on blush or mascara when they’re stuck at home is a serious issue.
In late March, E.L.F. Beauty said it saw a “significant decline” in retail sales in the last two weeks of that month. The company’s stock is down 40 percent since mid-February. Sales at Estée Lauder Companies dropped 11 percent in its fiscal third quarter, which ended March 31. Its stock is down 20 percent since mid-February.
Sales of higher-end beauty products through department stores and retailers like Ulta Beauty and Sephora dropped about 14 percent in the first quarter, said Larissa Jensen, a vice president at the NPD Group, a research firm.
But sales of skin-care products had been on the uptick for the last three years, Ms. Jensen said. And in recent weeks, sales of skin-care products surpassed makeup sales for the first time ever, she said.
Apple plans to reopen a few U.S. stores next week.
Apple said on Friday that it would reopen stores in four states next week, instituting temperature checks for customers and employees and limiting the number of people inside each store at any given time.
The company will also provide face coverings for customers who want them.In March, Apple had closed more than 450 of its stores, or nearly every location outside of China, in response to the coronavirus outbreak. In recent weeks, it has begun to slowly reopen some stores, including in Australia, Austria and South Korea.
Next week, the company will add stores in Alabama, Alaska, Idaho and South Carolina to that list, starting with its store in Boise on Monday. It has six stores in those states, but an Apple spokesman said not all would open next week.
The E.U. laid out its rules on how governments can take stakes in local companies.
The European Union said on Friday that governments in the bloc would have to restrict dividends, share buybacks and bonus payments at companies that receive economic relief in the form of a stake sale or certain kinds of debt.
“As the crisis evolves, many businesses will also need capital to stay afloat,” the E.U.’s competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said in a statement. “If member states decide to step in, we will apply today’s rules to ensure that taxpayers are sufficiently remunerated and their support comes with strings attached.”
A government should only buy a stake in a business if there is no other option, the E.U. said, and any “aid must be limited to enabling the viability of the company.”
The plan to allow stake sales came hours after Christine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, said the European Union should deploy more financial firepower to help the worst-hit members.
“If not all countries are cured from this crisis, the others will suffer — and not just in terms of health, but economically too,” Ms. Lagarde said at an event organized by the European University Institute.
Countries may need to issue as much as 1.5 trillion euros, or $1.6 trillion, in new debt to pay for corporate loan guarantees, unemployment subsidy programs and other measures to keep their economies afloat, Ms. Lagarde said. That is three times as much as European Union leaders have jointly committed so far.
Rent payments are holding up this month, a landlords’ group reports.
Apartment rent collections are surprisingly strong so far this month, with an industry survey showing that a vast majority of tenants have made payments.
Through the first six days of May, 80.2 percent of tenants paid at least some of their rent, compared with 81.2 percent a year earlier, according to a survey of 11.4 million apartments by the National Multifamily Housing Council, a trade group for large apartment owners. That was better than the first week of April, when 78 percent of tenants paid some or all of their rent. By the end of the month, the figure had risen to almost 95 percent.
A similar story has played out in state surveys and corporate earnings reports, with publicly traded apartment companies reporting strong rent collections in April and May.
Government stimulus checks and expanded unemployment benefits appear to have helped backstop consumer finances. Still, there are concerns about the trade-offs that low-income renters must make to pay their rent, and how long they can continue to do so with millions of new unemployment claims filed each week.
Two Democrats, Representative Denny Heck of Washington and Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, introduced bills on Friday providing $100 billion to cover about six months of housing costs for tenants. “This bill will help tenants pay their rent, without placing the burden on landlords,” Mr. Heck said in a statement.
The handling of the Paycheck Protection Program was faulty, inspector.The Small Business Administration’s inspector general said on Friday that flaws in how the agency put the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program into place were likely to have left rural, minority and women-owned businesses unable to get loans and could leave thousands of borrowers saddled with debt.
The report represents the first formal review of the embattled Paycheck Protection Program, which is the centerpiece of the government’s economic relief effort. The program, created as part of the $2 trillion CARES Act, has funneled billions of dollars to firms struggling to cope with the coronavirus pandemic, but has been criticized for favoring bigger businesses and for complex requirements that are out of step with economic realities.
According to the inspector general’s report, the S.B.A. did not issue guidance to ensure that lenders would prioritize underserved communities, as required by law.
The report also highlights another concern that has gripped borrowers: the S.B.A.’s rule that 75 percent of loan proceeds be used to cover payroll costs and 25 percent go overhead costs such as rent.
Because so many businesses will remain shuttered after the eight-week loan period, and because many workers have opted to take more generous unemployment insurance benefits, businesses are fearful that they will be unable to spend enough of the loan money on payroll. In that event, parts of the loans would not be forgiven, saddling the borrowers with debt.
Demand has dropped sharply for small-business loans to cover payroll.
Nearly two weeks after the Paycheck Protection Program began making its second round of loans, nearly 40 percent of the funds remain unclaimed — surprising lenders who thought the money would vanish fast.
Just over $185 billion of the program’s $310 billion had been allocated as of Thursday evening, the Small Business Administration said in its latest report. Intended to help small companies keep their workers employed, the program offers a forgivable loan to cover eight weeks of payroll and certain other operating expenses, like rent.
But growing concern among business owners over the program’s complex and still-changing rules has damped demand. Some who took the cash are sitting on it. Those who do not spend the money on payroll will not have the loan forgiven, saddling them with a large debt during an economic collapse. For many owners, though, hiring back workers in the face of so much uncertainty does not make sense.
Carrie Morey owns Callie’s Hot Little Biscuit, a small group of restaurants in Atlanta, Charleston and Charlotte, N.C. She got a loan in the paycheck program’s second round, but is hoping for rule changes to make it more flexible. She would like to have a much longer period to bring back workers and still have her loan forgiven.
“Even if tomorrow everything were fine and we were to go back to business as usual, it’s going to take months for us to get customers to come in the door,” Ms. Morey said Thursday at a virtual gathering of business owners.
Stocks rally as investors look past staggering unemployment figures.
Stocks rose on Friday, following global markets higher after upbeat comments from U.S. and Chinese officials about recent trade talks between the two countries.
The S&P 500 climbed more than 1 percent. European markets were higher after a broadly positive day in Asia.
Investors were cheered by the prospects of countries further reopening their economies, despite worries that those efforts could lead to a rise in infections. They were also bolstered by announcements from the United States and China that appeared to back their Phase 1 trade deal, which would bring their two-year trade war to a temporary truce. The White House had openly questioned China’s commitment to the deal in recent days, hurting stocks.
The optimism was widespread. Prices for U.S. Treasury bonds, which generally rise in troubled times, were lower. Oil prices also rose.
But more grim economic data was released on Friday. The report on April payrolls in the United States is showed a loss of more than 20.5 million jobs — a breathtaking drop — and a sharp jump in the unemployment rate. Corporate earnings reports, too, are reflecting the heavy toll of the pandemic. Siemens, the European industrial giant, said profit fell 64 percent in the first quarter.
The stock market has shown a remarkable indifference to the dire outlook for the economy since it began to rally on March 23. That was the day the Federal Reserve signaled that it stood ready to pump an unlimited amount of dollars into financial markets to keep key borrowing markets from malfunctioning.
Catch up: Here’s what else is happening.Bed Bath & Beyond announced plans for a phased-in approach to reopen approximately 20 stores by May 22, but the majority of stores would remain closed until at least May 30. The company plans to promote store safety with hand sanitizer and wipes, occupancy limits, social distancing and curbside pickup. Bed Bath & Beyond also owns Buybuy Baby and Harmon Face Values, which sell essential goods and have remained open during the pandemic.The German airline Lufthansa said Friday it would resume flights next month to popular European holiday destinations like the Mediterranean islands of Mallorca and Crete, and Sylt in the North Sea. Starting June 1, Lufthansa will double the number of aircraft in service, to 160.The electronics and engineering giant Siemens, a bellwether for the German economy, reported that first-quarter profit fell by more than half as new orders slumped. Siemens said that sales had slipped a modest 1 percent compared with the first quarter of 2019. But new orders fell 9 percent largely because of lower demand for passenger trains. Profit fell 64 percent.Reporting and research was contributed by Alan Rappeport, Conor Dougherty, Gregory Schmidt, Jack Nicas, Nelson D.

Wuhan. Bergamo. Seattle. New Rochelle.By the time cast, crew and fans assembled on March 9 for the first preview of a new musical version of “Mrs. Doubtfire,” the coronavirus was at the stage door.
All over Broadway, theater operators were installing hand sanitizer dispensers and scrubbing armrests. Ticket holders were beginning to bail.
“Hadestown” barred stage-door greetings. An usher who worked at “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?” and “Six” tested positive for Covid-19. And “Moulin Rouge!” canceled a day’s performances because a company member was feverish.
“Mrs. Doubtfire” got through three performances before Broadway shut down.“Our house manager texted us and told us to hold on, and then she said, ‘Don’t come, don’t come, don’t come’,” recalled Lisa Berger, a “Doubtfire” usher. “It wasn’t a total surprise, to be honest. I just didn’t think it was going to happen that quickly.”
Now two months have gone by, and almost everyone associated with the production — about 150 people — is out of work: actors and musicians, obviously, but also bartenders and box office workers, carpenters and choreographers, designers and dressers, programmers and propmasters. A few vendors — the publicists, for example — were furloughed and then rehired under the federal Paycheck Protection Program — but even they expect to be unemployed when that money runs out after eight weeks.
“People think of Broadway as very glamorous, but I don’t think they understand how many families and lives depend on it,” said David Korins, the show’s set designer. He was forced to lay off most of his employees after all 24 productions his company was working on, including “Hamilton,” “Dear Evan Hansen” and “Beetlejuice,” abruptly stopped.
“Everything went away,” he said. “It was a cascade. And, by the way, I fully endorse it. But, literally, our income went to zero.”
Broadway, of course, is a summit for theatermakers, a symbol of New York and a big business that, until now, had been enjoying an extended boom. Last year was the best attended on record, with 14.6 million patrons; Broadway shows collectively grossed $1.8 billion.
The shutdown brought an abrupt end to that prolonged party. And among the 39 plays and musicals halted were 16 that never even made it to opening night, “Doubtfire” included.
“Doubtfire” was a big bet, aimed squarely at the sweet spot of the Broadway audience: a $17 million musical, adapted from a hit movie, that aspired to be funny, poignant and family-friendly.
Now the “Doubtfire” family has scattered across the country — some as close as Times Square, some as far as London — trying to stay safe and sane. They, like the rest of their theater world colleagues, have no idea when New York will settle in to some new normal, no idea when Broadway will attempt a comeback. They are worried, but also hopeful — a microcosm of an industry that is distressed but determined.
‘We’re doing the right thing.’“Mrs. Doubtfire” is a story about family. One family, really: The Hillards — Daniel, Miranda and their three children. The parents split up, and the father (memorably portrayed in the 1993 film by Robin Williams) is so determined to spend time with his children that he pretends to be a woman to land a job as the housekeeper.
Hilarity ensues. Trouble looms. Lessons are learned.After a five-week pre-Broadway run at Seattle’s 5th Avenue Theater, the stage adaptation headed for Broadway facing headwinds — reviews in Seattle were mixed, shifting gender politics had made men in dresses an unreliable laugh line, and a stage adaptation of “Tootsie” had just flopped. Plus, every Broadway show is enormously risky, because most of them fail.
But the producers, led by the Broadway veteran Kevin McCollum (“Rent,” “Avenue Q”), were feeling confident as they sped toward an April 5 opening night. The audiences in Seattle seemed to like the show. And the lead actor, Rob McClure, who scored a Tony nomination for playing the title role in “Chaplin,” starred in “Honeymoon in Vegas,” and was featured most recently in “Beetlejuice,” was nailing his bifurcated performance.
Then, McClure said, “The universe hit pause.”On that final day, the cast had gathered for an afternoon rehearsal knowing that, at any time, Broadway might shut down. “I’ll never forget checking my phone during our Wednesday evening performance and seeing that the N.B.A. had suspended the season, and knowing what was coming,” said Brad Oscar, a two-time Tony nominee for “Something Rotten!” and “The Producers.”
Jenn Gambatese, the actress starring as Miranda (a role played on film by Sally Field), was center stage, rehearsing new blocking for her big solo number, when a stage manager told the company to brace for a closing announcement. She kept going for another 90 minutes.
“I felt calmer than I had in a while, and felt like I could focus better,” said Gambatese, who had been so unnerved by the drumbeat of virus news that she brought a suitcase to work in case her commuter rail line was shut down and she got stuck in Midtown. “Every day was getting scarier and scarier,” she said.
Midafternoon, McCollum and the show’s director, Jerry Zaks, assembled the company and told everyone to grab their stuff and go home.
And just like that, it was over. The costumes were stored in dressing rooms. The souvenir tote bags and tumblers were locked in a cabinet. The ghost light — a bare bulb placed onstage when a theater is empty — was illuminated.
Many expected they’d be back in four weeks — the initial projected length of the shutdown. “I remember placing my pencil down on my script and thinking to myself, ‘It’s so weird — that pencil is going to be in exactly the same place when we come back in a month,’” said Philip S. Rosenberg, the lighting designer.
McClure went home to Philadelphia. Tara Llewellyn, a dresser, joined her grandmother in Connecticut. KJ Hippensteel, a member of the ensemble, fled to his father-in-law’s house in Cleveland with his wife and their two sons.
“Both of us lost our jobs, for now, and we had no reason to stay,” he said. “Really, we panicked and had to take action to feel like we were in control. In hindsight I think we were super lucky to have gotten out when we did.”
Among those who stayed: Peter Bartlett, a comedic character actor and the oldest member of the cast, who plays a television host named Mr. Jolly. “At 77, this is the true passages of terror,” he said.
Most of the time, Bartlett has been holed up in his one-bedroom apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, sustained by savings, Social Security and union pensions, talking to friends, reading, cleaning his kitchen and washing his hands. “Did I ever think I’d watch a dog rescue on YouTube? Now I’ve watched hundreds of them,” he said. “Anything to distract myself.”
Others are finding their own distractions, like making ice cream, or practicing yoga. “Destruction leaves a lot of creative space to occupy,” said Akilah Ayanna, an ensemble member who is working on an album.
So Alexandra Matteo, a company member who understudies several parts, is podcasting. Tommy Kurzman, the makeup and prosthetics designer, adopted a dog. Paul Woodiel, the concertmaster, is singing cowboy songs with his wife (they are both violinists).
“We have nice harmonies going on ‘Keep on the Sunny Side,’” he said, “if only I could get through the lyrics without choking up.”
‘It has upended our lives.’Broadway is a coveted corner of the theater world for many reasons — prestige, large audiences, enormous talent. But it’s important for a much more materialistic reason: in a low-paying, high unemployment field, it’s a place where theater artists can earn a good salary. The base pay for actors on Broadway is about $2,200 a week.
But the shutdown has thrown thousands out of work. Most union members got a few weeks’ pay after the closing, but that has long since ended. And the usual fallbacks when stage shows are scarce — television, film, even waiting tables — are unavailable during this phase of the pandemic.
“Pretty much everyone I know is planning on not paying their rent, because how are we expected to do that?” said Cameron Rasmussen, one of the show’s three guitarists.
Several members of the company are married to others in the industry, meaning they are now facing a double income loss. Michael Rico Cohen, a stage manager, is married to a freelance television producer. “It’s going to be quite a few months before either of us sees a real paycheck again,” he said. And Colleen Dietz, the show’s music copyist (preparing the score for individual musicians), is married to Zachary Dietz, the music director. “I know we will come back from this, but it will be a long, hard road for New York and for our family,” she said.
Among the more complex predicaments is that facing the family of 9-year-old Lily Tamburo, who was cast as the understudy for Natalie, one of the three Hillard children. Lily lives in the Setaukets, on Long Island, with her mother and three older siblings; when the late-night commute proved too exhausting at her age, her mother, Lauren Zummo, rented an apartment in the city for the two of them. But when the pandemic hit, Zummo was forced to shut down the Pilates and yoga studio she runs on Long Island, and, of course, Lily lost her income. Zummo was able to walk away from the Manhattan sublet, but not the studio, where her landlord is insisting on being paid.
“The virus has bankrupted us, obviously,” Zummo said.This pandemic is primarily a public health crisis, and Broadway has been hit hard by the disease — multiple members of the “Moulin Rouge!” cast fell ill, as did a number of theater artists, producers and publicists. The “Doubtfire” family has been relatively fortunate on that front, but not unscathed.
Korins, the set designer, lost his uncle to Covid-19. He was 80, and had just moved in January from Florida to Yonkers, N.Y., where he fell ill at an assisted-living facility and died at a hospital. “He died alone, not having spoken to anyone for several days,” Korins said. “It’s one of those unbelievably tragic moments.”
Others have found themselves caring for those infected. Calvin L. Cooper, an actor in the ensemble, saw one friend test positive for Covid-19, and then another fall ill.
“For nine long, scary days I helped nurse my friend back to stable levels,” he said. “He is called presumably positive. I am presumably asymptomatic.”
And both members of the show’s choreography team — Lorin Latarro, the choreographer, and MJ Slinger, her associate, are partnered with doctors who worked with Covid patients. Latarro is married to a neurosurgeon who was redeployed to Covid care; she and their 2-year-old daughter moved out for several weeks to avoid infection. “I know some families have it worse,” she said. “We are back home together now.”
‘I can’t control if my voice changes.’Maria Dalanno was one of the last people to join the “Doubtfire” cast. She was 18 and still in high school in Ohio when she submitted an audition video shot by her mother; five days later, she booked a part as the understudy for Lydia, the older Hillard daughter.
She left high school, deferred college and moved to New York. Now she’s back home, playing with her dog and painting.
“I made my debut in previews, and then moved right back home in the midst of a pandemic,” she said. “I am now worrying about following social distancing guidelines, being able to pay for my apartment, and when I will see my new friends and castmates again.”
For the six performers playing children in the “Doubtfire” cast — each character has an understudy — the shutdown has been particularly tough to understand.
“Getting a break on Broadway, especially for a child, is nothing short of a miracle,” said Shanna Sell, whose 9-year-old daughter, Avery Sell, was making her Broadway debut as Natalie, the younger Hillard daughter. The Sells live in Florida, and Avery is now back in New Port Richey. “Having the rug pulled out from underneath her little feet, just weeks before her debut, has been nothing short of heartbreaking,” Shanna Sell said.
Jake Ryan Flynn, the 13-year-old Massachusetts boy who plays the Hillards’ son, Christopher, has his own concern — that if the Broadway shutdown drags on, he will age out of the role. This is his second Broadway show — he was one of three boys alternating in the title role of “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,” and he knows that contracts allow producers to replace children as they grow too tall.
“My parents keep telling me to only worry about what I can control,” he said. “But right now it feels like I’m in control of nothing in my life. I can’t control if I grow. I can’t control if my voice changes. I can’t control when I will see my cast mates again. I can’t control if the creatives and producers take a look at me in a few months and fire me because I’m too big. It just makes me sad.”
‘It felt like a miracle that we were all able to connect.’The invitations came from Mark Evans, a Welsh actor playing Stuart Dunmire, the new love interest for Miranda Hillard.
Put on something fun. Grab a snack or a drink. Turn on your computer.On April 5, the night that “Doubtfire” was scheduled to open on Broadway, the company instead gathered online and performed the show — beginning to end — just for one another.
They called it their Fauxpening. Eighty-two people participated. Kaleigh Cronin, an ensemble member sheltering with her husband and dog at her parents’ house in New Hampshire, wore the dress from her 8th grade dance, which she found in her childhood closet.
There were speeches and stories, songs and slip-ups — Evans was so busy organizing that when the second act rolled around he forgot his lines. Onscreen, the actors sang their songs. In the chat section, some of the stage managers typed out cues.
“Zoom was still a novelty, as opposed to the norm,” Evans said. “It felt like a miracle that we were all able to connect.”
There are other forms of connection, too. Felicia Shulman, the guardian responsible for protecting the show’s child actors, has tried to knit the four youngest members of the cast together through group texts and FaceTime. “Keeping them all in touch is something that I think is very important during this time of the unknown,” she said.
There’s also a newsletter of sorts. Aaron Kaburick, an actor who plays several minor characters including a “Chef Louis,” distributes a weekly email. It was originally called “Chicken on the Block,” a reference to the show’s spatchcocking scene; it’s now called “Chicken on the Couch,” because of the quarantine. The publication is just a few sentences — fabricated gossip, inside jokes, the ensemble member Doreen Montalvo’s recipe for “Quarantine Coquito” and a “Doubtfire”-choreography-inspired workout routine from Casey Garvin, an understudy.
And there are ongoing get-togethers. Fauxpening was three weeks and three days after the closing, so, at Gambatese’s suggestion, the company decided to plan another reunion every three weeks and three days. The second one was late last month. “It was adorable,” McClure said. “We shouted over one another.”
‘It’s so empty, it’s unreal.’The Stephen Sondheim Theater, where “Doubtfire” was being staged, exhibits many of Broadway’s real estate complexities. Its history, and its facade on West 43rd Street, go back to 1918, but the interior, which opened in 2009, is underground, beneath the 55-story Bank of America Tower at One Bryant Park.
The 1,055-seat theater is operated by a nonprofit, the Roundabout Theater Company, which is renting it to the commercial producers of “Mrs. Doubtfire.”
The building is still “Doubtfire”-branded, with a marquee and pastel-colored posters promoting the show. But there are also signs of the times: Anita’s Way, a pedestrian passage alongside the theater, has become, with the disappearance of pedestrians, a resting spot for the homeless.
The only person still regularly going inside is Deosarran, a one-named 58-year-old Guyanese immigrant who works for Roundabout as a building engineer.
Once or twice a week, Deosarran — everyone calls him Dino — gets into his car and drives in to Times Square from his home in Harrison, N.J., to make his rounds at the four theaters Roundabout operates in Midtown. He starts early — around 5 a.m. — to increase the ease of social distancing, and he checks the buildings’ temperature, the humidity, the plumbing and even the roofs.
“In the beginning I was nervous, but I bought some masks and gloves and I mingle with no one,” said Deosarran, who moved to the United States at age 14, took a job pumping gas and has been working in Broadway theaters for most of his adult life. “It’s very strange to see these theaters with no show. On 42nd Street you see one or two people walking. It’s unbelievable.”
There are other eyes on the building — security, cops and a few less expected observers. Connie Robinson, the manager of theater operations for Roundabout, monitors by video camera from her home in the Bronx while baking up a storm — sweet potato buns, banana pudding cheesecake, crepes. “It’s so empty, it’s unreal,” she said.
And James Kabel, the wardrobe supervisor, walks over from his apartment in Times Square. He gazes at the “Doubtfire” images on the theater’s windows, just “to make sure it’s not just a dream.”
‘I’m not going to imagine anything but that it’s going to happen.’It was one of the first scenes the writers cooked up: Deep in the second act, Daniel Hillard would have a nightmare in which he is haunted by multiple Mrs. Doubtfires, forcing him to confront his feelings of inadequacy.
The power rock song, “You’ve Created a Monster,” was rousingly sung, wild to look at (a stageful of Doubtfires!), and regularly prompted applause. But gnawing at the creative team was the sense that it stopped the storytelling.
The problem: The number as written suggested that Daniel Hillard’s big fear was that Mrs. Doubtfire was better than him. But the musical is fueled by his more fundamental terror: that he would lose his children.
So, in one of the surest signs that Team “Doubtfire” fully expects the show to return, the now-dispersed creative team, who previously collaborated on “Something Rotten!”, overhauled the song via Skype. Wayne Kirkpatrick, back home in Nashville; his brother, Karey Kirkpatrick, in Los Angeles; and John O’Farrell, in London.
So they decided to refocus the scene. “You can’t have a song that’s not moving the story forward,” Karey Kirkpatrick said. “So we made it about the kids — they’re no longer dressed as Doubtfires, and there are lyric changes to support the storytelling.”
And they set about shortening the musical’s ending. “You want to leave them wanting more, as opposed to saying get on with it already,” Karey Kirkpatrick said.
Trimming was not easy because in the final 12 minutes McClure has six costume changes, from Hillard to Doubtfire and back again — and each one takes at least 23 seconds. But the writers now have a series of proposed cuts they want to test whenever they get back to the stage.
“If you just listen, the show will tell you what it needs,” Karey Kirkpatrick said.
It’s unclear what happens next. Industry leaders say that September is the earliest they can imagine Broadway resuming performances, but that it is possible shows won’t return until next year.
Broadway has multiple vulnerabilities: high costs, tightly packed seating, and a fan base that includes many tourists and seniors.
The longer the shutdown continues, the more shows are expected to close before even opening, succumbing to cash flow issues and economic concerns. Zaks, a four-time Tony winner directing on Broadway for the 25th time with “Doubtfire,” refuses even to consider that this show could be among the missing. “I’m not going to imagine anything but that it’s going to happen,” he said.
He can take solace from McCollum, the lead producer, who vows that “Doubtfire” will return. “I’m sad that everyone has to wait, but the show is ready to go, and when people gather, we’ll be ready to open,” he said. “We’re birthing this new piece, and I can’t wait to show it to the world.”
As for McClure, the show’s star, he is practicing a combination of patience and optimism.“I don’t think it would be in Broadway’s best interest to open too soon and be part of another wave of this — I don’t think anyone in our industry is interested in that,” he said. “But when I think about the first night back, when the overture starts and the curtain goes up, I choke up. I really do. It’s the culmination of everything we’re craving — more than the singing and the dancing and this great American art form, it’s a bunch of people telling a story and a bunch of people receiving a story. We’re craving the collective experience of being human. And that’s what theater is.”"

This briefing has ended. Read our global live coverage here.
Trump released national guidelines to control the virus.The Trump administration released new guidelines on Monday to slow the spread of the coronavirus, including closing schools and avoiding groups of more than 10 people, discretionary travel, bars, restaurants and food courts.
Mr. Trump, flanked by task force members including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the guidelines would apply for 15 days.
“It seems to me if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that’s much lower than the other way had we not done a good job, but people are talking about July, August,” Mr. Trump said about the duration of the crisis.
The new measures reflected the increasing gravity of global attempts to contain the virus as governments around the world, from Canada to Hungary, moved to close their borders to foreign travelers. They left unanswered the question of precisely what individuals and local governments should do, or how business owners and workers might survive financially, at a time when vast sections of the economy were ceasing to function.
“If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now,” Mr. Trump said, “we will rally together as one nation and we will defeat the virus and we’re going to have a big celebration all together.”
Hours earlier, Mr. Trump told a group of governors they should not wait for the federal government to fill the growing demand for respirators needed to help people diagnosed with coronavirus.
“Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” Mr. Trump told the governors during the conference call, a recording of which was shared with The New York Times.
The suggestion surprised some of the governors, who have been scrambling to contain the outbreak and looking to the federal government for help with equipment, personnel and financial aid.
At the briefing with the president, Dr. Fauci said the first phase of testing of a possible vaccine had begun on Monday. He stressed that some of the White House guidelines were inconvenient, but that they would help stop the spread of the virus and were not an overreaction.
“When you’re dealing with an emerging infectious diseases outbreak,” he said, “you are always behind where you think you are.”
Measures to slow the virus are slowing the economy, too.
It was clear on Monday that most of the American economy was grinding to a halt, and would remain that way for months, because of the coronavirus outbreak and the sweeping steps being taken to try to halt it.
On Wall Street, brokers and analysts were acting as if an economic collapse were inevitable, despite the Federal Reserve’s emergency moves on Sunday night to stoke economic growth through an aggressive bond-buying program. The S&P 500 fell nearly 12 percent on Monday and global oil prices slid below $30 a barrel, a four-year low.
“We’re calling the recession,” said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. “We have the three elements to make that call — a profound, pervasive and persistent contraction in economic activity.”
Business groups, local and state leaders and a growing chorus of lawmakers and economists begged the federal government to spend trillions of dollars to pay workers to stay home and funnel money to companies struggling with an abrupt end to consumer activity.
The administration floated several ideas for helping industry without conveying a clear plan. After the main trade group for airlines suggested a $50 billion bailout, Mr. Trump’s chief economist, Larry Kudlow, said, “We don’t see the airlines failing, but if they get into a cash crunch we’re going to try to help them.”
Employers and employees are torn between fears of being exposed to the virus and fears of running out of money to pay for food and electricity. And government officials are left with the unhappy task of shutting down businesses that provide wages for large swaths of their communities, while wondering what steps their neighbors are taking.
On Monday, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah called for the government to cut a $1,000 check, immediately, to every American.
“People don’t have reserves, they live hand-to mouth,” said Joseph Stiglitz, a Nobel-winning economist. “People won’t be able to pay their rents, landlords won’t be able to pay their oil bills, the whole system could break down.”
The consequences of China’s harsh measures to halt the virus — restricting the movement of about 700 million people at one point — became apparent on Monday when the government released economic data showing industrial output falling to its lowest level in decades and unemployment rising at its highest rate ever in February.
The Kentucky Derby is postponed until September.For the first time since World War II, the Kentucky Derby will not take place on the first Saturday in May.
The Derby, the first jewel of horse racing’s Triple Crown, became the latest marquee sporting event forced to postpone because of the deepening coronavirus pandemic.
Churchill Downs will hold a conference call on Tuesday morning to announce a makeup date for the race, which is expected to be Sept. 5. The Courier-Journal newspaper in Louisville, Ky., where the race is held, had earlier reported the postponement.
The race, which touts itself as the “most exciting two minutes in sports,” regularly draws more than 150,000 spectators to the famed racetrack with its twin spires.
The coronavirus has transformed the sporting landscape. The N.B.A., the N.H.L. and Major League Baseball have all suspended play, and the N.C.A.A. canceled all of its championships.
Racetracks across the country have been shuttered to the public, but races are still being run and bets are still being welcomed. According to The Courier-Journal, the Derby and the weeks of celebration that surround it infuse the region with about $400 million yearly.
In 1945, the Kentucky Derby was held on June 9, about a month after the government lifted a ban on horse racing that it put in place because of World War II. The only other year the race did not take place on the first Saturday in May was in 1901.
Latin America begins grappling with the virus.
Stringent measures were imposed over the weekend in several Latin American nations, where the outbreak has generally arrived later than in Europe or North America.
In Venezuela, President Nicolás Maduro — an authoritarian leader whose government is considered illegitimate by the United States and about 60 other nations — seized on the upheaval caused by the pandemic to present himself as a responsible guardian of public health.
On Monday night, in an announcement made on state TV, Mr. Maduro said a nationwide quarantine would take effect Tuesday at 5 a.m. local time. The country is now at 33 cases, according to Mr. Maduro, who called the move “a drastic and necessary measure.”
Earlier in the day, he responded to 17 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country by ordering a lockdown of the capital, Caracas, and six other states on Monday. “We either go into quarantine, or the pandemic could brutally and tragically bring down our country,” he said in a terse televised speech on Sunday that was a departure from his typically rambling addresses. He called on the United States to loosen sanctions against his government.
Other Latin American countries have also responded to dozens of confirmed cases. Ecuador and Peru announced countrywide lockdowns. President Iván Duque of Colombia shut the borders to nonresidents. In Costa Rica, the government decreed a state of emergency that included closing its borders.
In contrast, President Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil encouraged mass demonstrations by his supporters against his opponents in Congress on Sunday. Though Mr. Bolsonaro has been close to people who tested positive for the virus, he shook hands and posed for photos with supporters.
Scientists say there are likely 5 to 10 undetected cases for every confirmed one.
Scientists tracking the spread of the coronavirus reported Monday that, for every confirmed case, there are most likely another five to 10 people in the community with undetected infections. On average these people are about half as infectious as confirmed ones, but they are responsible for transmitting the virus in nearly 80 percent of new cases, according to the report, which was based on data from China.
The researchers modeled the virus’s natural spread in China before the government instituted a travel ban and an aggressive testing policy. During that time, from December 2019 through late January, about 85 percent of cases went undetected. That situation is analogous to the current state of affairs in the United States and other Western countries, where tests are not widely available, the researchers said.
“If we have 3,500 confirmed cases in the U.S., you might be looking at 35,000 in reality,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and the senior author of the new report, which was posted by the journal Science.
The report is among the first to address two pressing questions: How many people are walking around with unrecognized infections, and how infectious are they? American policymakers have begun taking more aggressive measures to slow transmission, like canceling events and closing restaurants, but access to tests has been difficult or nonexistent in much of the country.
The E.U. plans to seal itself off from almost all international travel.
The top official of the European Union said on Monday that she was proposing a shutdown of all nonessential travel into the bloc. President Emmanuel Macron of France said national leaders would approve the plan on Tuesday.
“We propose to introduce a temporary restriction to non-essential travel to the European Union,” said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, after a teleconference with G7 leaders. “Of course there will be exemptions for E.U. citizens coming back home, health care workers, doctors and nurses.”
The restriction would last for 30 days, and would not interfere with travel from one European Union country to another. But some of the member states have already taken steps in that direction.
Ten of the 26 countries that make up the passport-free Schengen Area have reintroduced border controls, partly or fully suspending the rules of the flagship European Union program, a spokesman for the European Commission said.
The Trump administration turns on itself.
Infighting, turf wars and a president more concerned with the stock market and media coverage than policy have defined the Trump White House. They have also defined how it has handled a pandemic.
The White House culture that President Trump has fostered and abided by for more than three years has shaped his administration’s response to a deadly pandemic that is upending his presidency and the rest of the country, with dramatic changes to how Americans live their daily lives.
It all explains how Mr. Trump could announce he was dismissing his acting chief of staff as the crisis grew more severe, creating even less clarity in an already fractured chain of command. And it was a major factor in the president’s reluctance to even acknowledge a looming crisis, for fear of rattling the financial markets that serve as his political weather vane.
Mr. Trump has refused repeated warnings to rely on experts, or to neutralize some of the power held by his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in favor of a traditional staff structure. He has rarely fully empowered people in the jobs they hold.
“Part of this is President Trump being Donald J. Trump, the same guy he’s always been, and part of it is a government he has now molded in his image, rather than having a government as it has traditionally been, to serve the chief executive, and to serve the job of governing the country,” said David Lapan, a former spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security and the Pentagon, and a former aide of Mr. Kelly.
Health officials order millions in the Bay Area to “shelter in place.”
Six counties in Northern California have ordered all residents to “shelter in place” in an effort to stop the coronavirus from surging.
The order, which takes effect Tuesday, is expected to disrupt life for millions of residents in Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Francisco, San Mateo, and Santa Clara counties. The city of Berkeley also issued the same order.
That means staying at home except for the most essential reasons. Officials said people would be allowed to leave the house for essential work, to go to a grocery store, pick up medication, or even walk the dog. But they urged everyone to practice social distancing while outside. “It is now time to do your part,” Dr. Scott Morrow, the San Mateo health officer, said in a statement.
“It’s asking people to go home with their families and to stay there until they are told otherwise,” said Mayor Joe Goethals of San Mateo, adding that only “essential” businesses like hospitals, grocery stores and pharmacies would remain open.
“I don’t expect anyone to get arrested,” said Mr. Goethals, who said people will still be allowed to go outside for limited activities, like buying food and getting fresh air. “But it’s not optional. This is mandatory for all of us.”
The number of coronavirus cases in the United States crossed the 4,000 mark on Monday, with more than 70 deaths, including the first deaths in Indiana, Nevada and South Carolina.
A growing number of cities and states have taken significant actions to slow the coronavirus, shutting down schools, restaurants, bars, movie theaters and gyms. The restrictions stretched from the now-empty sidewalks of New York City, where officials had made the wrenching decision to shut down public schools, to the fields and urban centers of Ohio. Millions of Americans are now hunkered down at home for the foreseeable future.
France imposes a nationwide lockdown.
Declaring “we are at war,” President Emmanuel Macron of France prohibited public gatherings of any size, postponed municipal elections and told people to stay in their homes except for essential needs.
His order, which goes into effect on Tuesday, is one of the most stringent anywhere in Europe. Officials said that going out for a walk to get some fresh air would be allowed, but meeting a friend on a street or in a park would be punishable with a fine.
Christophe Castaner, the interior minister, said anyone on a public outing would need to carry a document justifying it, even if only a sworn statement written by that person. He said that 100,000 law enforcement officers would be deployed to enforce the order.
Olivier Véran, France’s health minister, said that the government was asking each French person to limit human contact to a maximum of five people a day. France, with more than 6,600 coronavirus cases and 148 deaths by Monday, had already ordered all “non-indispensable” businesses closed.
“We will be able to end the confinement,” Mr. Véran said in a post on Twitter. “But without confinement, we will not be able to end the epidemic.”
Spain, with almost 10,000 cases and more than 300 deaths by Monday, also ordered residents to mostly stay at home, though it is still allowing most people to go to work and has not announced any punitive measures. Schools, restaurants and bars were ordered to close.
The pace of new coronavirus infections reported in Europe accelerates daily — roughly 6,000 on Thursday, 7,000 on Friday, 8,000 on Saturday, 9,000 on Sunday and 10,000 on Monday, bringing the total to about 62,000. France and Spain warned that their health care systems could be overwhelmed.
And in Italy, still the hardest-hit country in Europe and the first to impose nationwide restrictions on movement, the government announced $28 billion in emergency aid to individuals, businesses and the health care system to stave off chaos and financial ruin.
Italy had almost 28,000 infections and more than 1,800 deaths as of Monday.The government’s aid package delays mortgage, loan and tax payments, and offers extended parental leave, sick leave for people in quarantine, babysitting vouchers, and grants for self-employed and seasonal workers.
“We never considered fighting a flood with buckets,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said. “We are trying to build a dam to protect businesses, families and workers.”
Ohio governor ignores court ruling and postpones Tuesday’s primary.
Ohio’s governor on Monday night said he and top state heath officials would ignore a court ruling and postpone Ohio’s presidential primary by declaring a public health emergency because of the coronavirus outbreak.
The governor, Mike DeWine, said that the state’s health director, Dr. Amy Acton, had issued the order based on concerns that the coronavirus outbreak placed both voters and poll workers in potential danger.
His announcement came just hours after Judge Richard A. Frye of the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas rejected the state’s request to push back voting to June 2.
Ohio was one of four states scheduled to vote on Tuesday. The other three — Arizona, Illinois and Florida — said that they planned to proceed with their elections while taking additional health precautions.
Kentucky also announced that it was delaying its primary.
U.S. airlines ask for $50 billion in emergency support from the government.
The lobbying group for America’s biggest airlines called on the government on Monday to provide more than $50 billion in grants, loan guarantees and tax relief. The group, Airlines for America, warned that the current situation was not sustainable for the industry and that there was no end in sight to the crisis.
“This is a today problem, not a tomorrow problem,” said Nicholas E. Calio, chief executive of Airlines for America. “It requires urgent action.”
The industry group said that flight cancellations are outpacing new bookings and that the decline in demand is getting worse by the day. The request included $25 billion in grants for passenger carriers, $4 billion in grants for cargo, $25 billion in loan guarantees.
On Sunday, United Airlines executives said they were in talks with union leaders about reducing payroll costs. The moves being considered include furloughs, pay cuts and reducing minimum hours.
United’s corporate officers will be taking a 50 percent pay cut, Oscar Munoz, the chief executive, and Scott Kirby, the president, said in a letter. Both have already said they would forgo their base salaries through June.
Reversing course, Britain says to avoid travel and contact with people.
In a sharp reversal, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday that everyone should avoid unnecessary travel and contact with others, should work at home and should stop going to places like bars, restaurants and theaters.
Mr. Johnson called the measures “very draconian,” but he stopped well short of the kinds of steps taken by some harder-hit European countries. He did not order schools or businesses closed, did not tell people to stay in their homes, and said the steps were not mandatory, but rather “giving very strong advice.”
Mr. Johnson and his government had faced harsh criticism for its laissez-faire approach to the pandemic. They had spoken hopefully of “herd immunity” — in which many people would be infected, recover and then, it is hoped, be immune — while it was inevitable that many people would take ill and die.
But at a news conference on Monday with top medical officials, he said: “Now is the time for everyone to stop nonessential contact with others and to stop all unnecessary travel.”
In particular, people over 70 and those with serious illnesses should avoid contact with others, Mr. Johnson said, suggesting that as a result, people should not visit nursing and retirement homes.
The English actor Idris Elba, who was in the HBO series “The Wire,” announced on Monday that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, sharing the news with fans in a video that he posted on Twitter.
“Transparency is probably the best thing for this right now,” said Mr. Elba, 47. “If you’re feeling ill or you feel like you should be tested or you’ve been exposed, then do something about it. It’s really important.”

59,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/09/sports/ufc-249-results.html,The New York Times,2020-05-09,"['Morgan Campbell', 'Kevin Draper']",How Justin Gaethje Won the Interim Lightweight Title at U.F.C. 249,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/09/sports/09ufc-live14/09ufc-live14-facebookJumbo.jpg,"
Justin Gaethje and Tony Ferguson were matched to provide action.In organizing the first major professional sporting event in North America since the Covid-19 pandemic prompted an industrywide shutdown eight weeks ago, the Ultimate Fighting Championship wanted to ensure that, with something of a monopoly on fan attention, the main event from U.F.C. 249 entertained.
And the fighters delivered violence — with Ferguson absorbing most of the punishment. Gaethje dominated the 36-year-old for nearly five rounds, pummeling him with heavy punches until the referee, Herb Dean, stopped the fight with 80 seconds remaining in the final frame.
All 11 bouts on the card unfolded in an arena free of spectators, with few people beyond fighters, their corners, U.F.C. and commission employees, broadcast crews and some journalists inside the building amid the ongoing pandemic.
A sold-out crowd that might otherwise have attended would have seen Gaethje beat Ferguson to the punch from the opening horn, peppering the veteran with counter right hands, left hooks and leg kicks. Ferguson wobbled Gaethje with an uppercut late in Round 2, but the rest of the fight the 31-year-old-Gaethje controlled the action with his heavy hands and crisp timing.
When he landed a sharp jab to Ferguson’s nose late in Round 5, Ferguson stumbled and Dean stopped the bout.
The win earned Gaethje the interim lightweight championship, but he refused to accept the belt, telling the in-ring interviewer, Joe Rogan, that he preferred to wait for the undisputed title. That title shot — against champion Khabib Nurmagomedov — could happen later this year if circumstances during the pandemic allow.
Ferguson was originally scheduled to face Nurmagomedov in a title fight, when the outbreak set off a chain of events that led to a new venue and kept the Russian champ from leaving his home country to fight.
Gaethje stepped in as a replacement.Here’s a look at how he won and how the rest of U.F.C. 249 unfolded:
Gaethje delivered punishment to Ferguson throughout the fight.
Round 1Tony Ferguson has a chin.Heavy-handed Justin Gaethje cracked him repeatedly with clean left hooks and right hands, and Ferguson, the U.F.C.’s top lightweight contender, just smiled and kept pressing forward with his own punches and kicks.
Ferguson likely didn’t win Round 1, but he proved he can take Gaethje’s punch.For now.Round 2For four minutes and 59 seconds, Gaethje beat Ferguson to the punch. Straight rights. Left hooks. Uppercuts. They all landed. Flush.
Ferguson took them all and kept advancing.A second before the end of the round, Ferguson tagged Gaethje with an explosive uppercut, dropping him to a knee.
Then the horn sounded and fighters retreated to their corners, Ferguson looking fresh and Gaethje breathing heavily.
Round 3Ferguson seems determined to wear Gaethje down by absorbing every punch Gaethje throws. A leg kick–left hook combination raised a welt under Ferguson’s left eye, and a heavy counter right hand caused Ferguson, for the first time all fight, to stumble backward for a moment.
By the end of Round 3, Ferguson had blood streaming down both cheeks and, likely, a deficit on the scorecards.
Round 4Four rounds in, it’s the fight you would expect in a matchup of relentless offensive fighters. Ferguson remains game, moving forward with punches and kicks. But Gaethje is a step ahead. An overhand right drove Ferguson across the ring, and a hard leg kick spun Ferguson sideways.
Gaethje had never fought past three rounds before tonight, but he looks comfortable and in control.Round 5The fight ended the way it started — with Tony Ferguson taking thunderous punches from Justin Gaethje.
With 90 seconds remaining, Gaethje wobbled Ferguson with a left jab to the nose. When he followed up with more punches, referee Herb Dean intervened to spare Ferguson further punishment.
The win makes Gaethje the U.F.C. interim lightweight champion, putting him in position to face Khabib Nurmagomedov later this year for the undisputed title.
“I knew I was a killer stepping in here,” Gaethje said in the octagon afterward. “I’m good, bro.”Nurmagomedov was clearly watching.
Cejudo hits Cruz with a knee, keeps his belt and then retires.
Round 1Dominick Cruz comes out moving, circling, darting in and out. Henry Cejudo, defending his U.F.C. bantamweight title, commits to heavy leg kicks, hoping to make Cruz more stationary.
Cruz, a longtime former champion, hasn’t fought since 2016, while Cejudo is competing for the first time in 11 months.
Round 2Early in Round 2, Cruz appeared to regain his rhythm, tagging Cejudo with several clean counter punches. Late in the round a clash of heads opened a bloody gash in Cejudo’s hairline, prompting a fight doctor to examine the wound.
When the action resumed, Cejudo struck, hitting Cruz with a knee to the face, then raining punches on him until the referee stopped the bout with just 2 seconds remaining in the round.
Cruz complained but the referee’s decision was final.“I’m a chameleon,” Cejudo said afterward in the ring. “I can adjust.”
Immediately afterward, a grinning Cejudo, wearing his UFC title belt and gold medal from the 2008 Summer Olympics, announced his retirement from professional fighting.
After winning gold, then two U.F.C. titles, Cejudo gave himself the nickname Triple C, in honor of the three global championships, and had spoken recently about moving up to the U.F.C.’s featherweight class to pursue a title there.
But Cejudo had also dealt with injuries, and entered Saturday’s fight after an operation on his shoulder.
One big punch from Ngannou and his fight ends in 20 seconds.
After Surinamese heavyweight Jairzinho Rozenstruik defeated veteran Alistair Overeem in November, he called out the No. 2 contender, Francis Ngannou. He figured his kickboxing skills would neutralize the Cameroonian’s power, and that a win would propel him to a heavyweight title shot.
Miscalculation.Ngannou needed less than half a minute to blast Rozenstruik, knocking him unconscious with a thunderous overhand punch. Rozenstruik slumped against the fence and needed immediate medical attention as the referee stopped the bout.
“When I heard he called me out, I knew he didn’t know what he was doing,” Ngannou deadpanned afterward.
Ngannou now will await the winner of a heavyweight title rematch between champion Stipe Miocic and former champ Daniel Cormier.
Calvin Kattar scored a knockout with two huge elbows.Jeremy Stephens entered Saturday with a weight advantage — the veteran featherweight missed the 146-pound contracted limit by 4.5 pounds, and had to forfeit 30 percent of his payout to his opponent, Calvin Kattar.
But Kattar, a 32-year-old fighter from Methuen, Mass., brought faster, heavier hands and a game plan to a fight he won by a spectacular second-round stoppage.
After weathering Stephens’s power punches early, Kattar peppered Stephens’s left leg with sharp kicks, raising dark welts on his thigh. Late in Round 1, Kattar landed a front kick and an overhand right that froze Stephens, a veteran of 47 pro fights.
Midway through Round 2, as Stephens wound up to throw a right hand, Kattar beat him to the punch, stepping to crack Stephens across the chin with a right elbow. Stephens crumpled and Kattar pounced, landing a left elbow that cut Stephens’s forehead, forcing the referee to stop the fight. Kattar is now 5-2 in U.F.C. bouts, and 21-4 overall.
Greg Hardy takes a unanimous decision by outworking Yorgan De Castro.
Greg Hardy was clearly the better athlete. The former All-Pro defensive lineman is long-limbed and limber, and quicker than Yorgan De Castro, his opponent in the heavyweight bout that opened the pay-per-view portion of U.F.C. 249.
But in the first round De Castro, a Cape Verde native now fighting out of Brocton, Mass., appeared to be the superior fighter, landing several sharp right hands to Hardy’s head, and series of chopping kicks to Hardy’s left thigh.
Then an apparent toe injury slowed De Castro midway through Round 2, allowing the 31-year-old Hardy to seize the initiative.
Afterward, Hardy said he blocked De Castro’s leg kick when he heard commentator Daniel Cormier suggest it at ringside. In an empty arena, the fighters can hear the broadcasters’ every word, and Hardy credited Cormier’s commentary with turning the fight in his favor.
Hardy (5-2, 1 no contest) recorded his first win of 2020, after competing five times in 2019.The quiet arena is affecting the fights themselves.
The absence of a crowd isn’t just affecting how viewers at home experience the presentation of the bouts — it is affecting the outcome of the fights themselves. Without 15,000 screaming fans, a number of fighters have mentioned in post-fight interviews that they could hear the commentary from television announcers Jon Anik, Joe Rogan and Daniel Cormier, who are seated just outside the octagon.
Carla Esparza, who won via a split decision, said she began diversifying her tactics after hearing Cormier critique her. And Greg Hardy started defending against kicks from Yorgan De Castro by checking his leg — bending and raising it up to protect the thigh — after hearing Cormier mention it. It worked, as De Castro appeared to hurt his foot on a wild kick that caught Hardy’s shin, and Hardy won by unanimous decision.
As the pay-per-view card began, Cormier and Rogan leaned into the weirdness of the event, which is under scrutiny as the first major U.S. sporting event since the coronavirus pandemic shut down the top leagues.
“I don’t understand why we’re so far away from each other but we’re so close right now. None of this makes any sense,” Rogan said during a conversation with Anik and Cormier as they stood in the same shot before moving back to their seats at separate tables.
The U.F.C. had fighters agree to not criticize its handling of the coronavirus.
The news that fighter Ronaldo Souza, known as Jacare, and two of his cornermen tested positive for the coronavirus Friday night drove home how difficult it is to safely hold events during this pandemic. But if any other fighters have concerns, you probably will not hear about them, as the U.F.C. clamped down on criticism of its health and safety guidelines.
U.F.C. 249 fighters could lose significant amounts of money if they “suggest or communicate” that the event is being held “without appropriate health, safety or other precautions,” according to a copy of a participation agreement obtained by The New York Times. If fighters violate this provision, the U.F.C. may “revoke all or any part of any prize monies or awards won by the Participant.” These can include “purses, win bonuses, other fight-related bonuses and event-based merchandise royalties.”
Asked for a comment on the contract, a spokeswoman for the U.F.C. pointed to an interview Dana White did with Yahoo Sports, where he said that only untrue statements about the U.F.C.’s health and safety procedures would violate the non-disparagement clause.
Nothing in the agreement obtained by The Times said that only untrue statements can be punished.President Trump congratulated the U.F.C. on holding the event.A surprise guest made an appearance early in the streaming portion of the telecast: President Trump.
A prerecorded video from the president was played between the second and third fights of the night. “I want to congratulate Dana White and the U.F.C. They’re going to have a big match,” he said, adding: “Get the sports leagues back, let’s play. You do the social distancing and whatever else you have to do, but we need sports. We want our sports back.”
The friendship between President Trump and White dates back nearly 20 years. The first U.F.C. event after White took over the mixed martial arts promotion company, U.F.C. 30 in 2001, was held at the Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City. White praised President Trump for supporting the U.F.C. when many casinos and arenas wouldn’t host their fights, and he paid back the favor by speaking in support of then-candidate Trump at the 2016 Republican National Convention.
In November, President Trump attended U.F.C. 244 at Madison Square Garden, becoming the first president to watch the U.F.C. in person while in office.
Anthony Pettis beats Donald Cerrone after a wild final round.
Round 1Donald Cerrone finished the first round against Anthony Pettis with swelling on his face, but at least he finished the first round.
Cerrone, who is better known as Cowboy, has lost his last three bouts, and was stopped in the first round of his previous two. He and Pettis competed evenly in Round 1, with Cerrone landing a takedown, and Pettis connecting with several clean punches.
Round 2One more close round. Cerrone completed another takedown. Pettis landed heavy blows to Cerrone’s body — a left hook and a spinning back kick.
Somebody has to win.These two fighters are 0-5 combined in their most recent fights.Round 3Cerrone landed a right kick to Pettis’s face. He knocked Matt Brown unconscious with a similar shot in 2016, but Pettis took it and kept fighting. Pettis had controlled much of Round 3 until then, but Cerrone’s thunderous right kick tilted the momentum his way.
For but a moment.Overall, the judges favored Pettis, awarding him the bout 29-28 on all three cards.
Oleinik dishes some punishment, then hangs on for a split decision.
As heavyweight Aleksei Oleinik pressed forward in the opening round, his cornermen shouted for him to hit Fabricio Werdum’s body.
Seemed like a good idea.Werdum entered the octagon with the sloping shoulders and fleshy midsection of a middle-aged dad — he’ll turn 43 in July. Oleinik had trimmed some body fat since his last U.F.C. fight nearly four months ago, but was actually the older of the two combatants by a month.
So while Oleinik dominated Round 1, by midway through the second, the bout looked exactly like a matchup between fighters whose combined age was 84. The pace of Oleinik’s attack slowed. Werdum managed to land a few punches, and wrestled Oleinik to the mat. They traded blows in the final round and the final buzzer sounded without a decisive winner.
In the end, two judges favored Oleinik’s power punching, awarding him a split decision. The win marked Oleinik’s 59th victory in 73 pro bouts. Werdum, a former U.F.C. heavyweight champion, dropped to 23-8-1.
Carla Esparza wins with a split decision.
Strawweight contenders Carla Esparza and Michelle Waterson spent two-and-a-half rounds in a tense, tactical, tightly contested chess match.
Then a fight erupted in the final 30 seconds.Waterson, a karate expert fighting out of Albuquerque, N.M., landed a left roundhouse kick to Esparza’s body. Esparza absorbed the blow but trapped Waterson’s leg and tried to drag her to the mat, where Esparza’s experience as a college wrestler would give her an advantage. Waterson escaped and Esparza landed a left-right combination. Esparza kept pursuing and Waterson swatted her across the face with a left roundhouse kick.
In a bout without a clear winner, the opinions among the judges were divided. One scored all three rounds for Esparza, while another awarded all three to Waterson. Esparza (16-6) prevailed on the third judge’s card to win her third straight U.F.C. bout.
Vicente Luque wins via a doctor’s stoppage in the third round.
Niko Price’s body didn’t give out, even after nearly three rounds of trading punches and kicks at midrange near the center of the octagon. And his fighting spirit didn’t break, even as blood streamed from a cut below his right eye and dripped from another cut above it.
But after welterweight Vicente Luque landed a perfectly timed counter left hook late in Round 3, Price hit the canvas. When the referee called timeout, the fight doctor looked at Price’s quickly swelling right eye, and the two cuts near it, and advised the referee to stop the bout.
Until then, Luque and Price had engaged in a brutal bout that resembled bare-knuckled kickboxing. Luque landed a big right hand over Price’s lazy left jab. Price connected with a front kick to Luque’s chin. Both fighters landed thudding kicks to each other’s thighs.
Luque looked drained late in Round 2, but in the late phases of the third landed the explosive left hook that ended the fight. The win was the 18th of Luque’s career, while Price drops to 14-4.
Bryce Mitchell dominates Charles Rosa in three rounds heavy on grappling.
On Friday afternoon, the U.F.C. featherweight contender Bryce Mitchell posted a photo of himself engaged in a post-weigh-in staredown with his opponent, Charles Rosa.
“Time to cook em to the bone,” the caption read.A day later Mitchell, a 25-year-old submission specialist, spent three rounds mauling Rosa, dragging him to the canvas and running him though an endless series of chokes, arm cranks and other holds designed to make opponents quit.
Rosa, a 33-year-old jiu-jitsu black belt, figured to challenge Mitchell if their bout turned into a grappling match, but the third time Mitchell pretzeled himself around Rosa and yanked on his arm, it was clear which fighter was more skilled in fighting on the ground.
Mitchell won on all three judges’ cards and is now 13-0, with nine wins by submission. Rosa moves to 12-4 overall.
Ryan Spann wins the first bout of the night with a split decision.
Ryan Spann finished the fight wobbly. Veteran light-heavyweight Sam Alvey hit him hard several times in the final round of the opening bout of U.F.C. 249, catching Spann with a short right hook, and later landing a flurry of blows before the final horn.
But Spann, a 28-year-old contender, had already won the first two rounds, and emerged with a split-decision win.
A second-round kick to Alvey’s head drew a reaction from octagon-side announcers and likely would have triggered cheers from spectators. Except Spann and Alvey met in a near-empty arena, with fans prohibited because of the coronavirus pandemic. Their bout had the feel of an exhibition, with the venue so quiet the camera’s mics picked up instructions from the fighters’ corners and even the athletes’ breathing.
Spann used well-timed front kicks and right hands to control the first two rounds and improved his overall pro record to 18-5. Saturday’s loss was Alvey’s fourth straight defeat.
The fights come as the sports world has been yearning for live events.
As televised live sports ground to a halt in mid-March, sports channels turned to their archives and served up a heaping portion of classic games. When there have been live events to show — the W.N.B.A. and N.F.L. drafts, Korean baseball — the production is stripped down and no fans are in attendance. So what will U.F.C. 249 look and sound like on television?
The arena the fights are taking place in seats 15,000, but no fans are allowed, so expect to hear a cavernous emptiness. Dana White told Sports Illustrated this week that he considered piping in crowd noise or some sort of virtual crowd, before deciding not to. The normal in-arena D.J. will be on-site, however, and viewers will likely hear more of the fighters themselves.
The announcers will be calling the fights from near the octagon but will be sitting apart from each other. After each fight, Joe Rogan will interview the winners from at least six feet away. The U.F.C. has not revealed its camera setup, but considering it has always controlled production, it is likely to look very similar to previous events.
At the start of its telecast, a standup shot included all three announcers — Jon Anik on play-by-play and analysts Rogan and Daniel Cormier — close together and without masks. They later appeared to speak from separate tables at different spots around the octagon.”People are starving. They’re starving for something, some action, some fun,” Rogan said.
U.F.C.’s owners insisted they were not holding the bouts because of financial pressures.Dana White went from downplaying the risk from the coronavirus to acknowledging it while insisting that the U.F.C. would be the first sport back. Why the rush?
It’s not financial, according to Mark Shapiro, the president of Endeavor, which owns the U.F.C. “We are not putting fights on to satisfy any contracts or because of any particular financial situation at Endeavor,” Shapiro said. Endeavor has $4.6 billion in debt, and has laid off, furloughed or cut the pay of a third of its 7,500 worldwide employees.
Instead, Shapiro and U.F.C. officials have said their efforts are in service of the athletes, who do not get paid unless they perform. “We have fighters itching to fight, and that have contracts that require us to put them into an octagon,” Shapiro said.
Who is Dana White?Dana White has been president of the U.F.C. for almost 20 years, a tenure that has seen mixed martial arts rise from a niche sport banned in many states to one minting worldwide superstars like Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey. But after earning hundreds of millions of dollars, why is he still working 24/7, and does the U.F.C. still need a bombastic street fighter as a leader?
We profiled White and took a look at the rewards staging fights during the coronavirus pandemic could bring, as well as legal, commercial and regulatory threats to the U.F.C.’s business.
Where is Khabib Nurmagomedov?The undefeated lightweight champion Khabib Nurmagomedov was supposed to headline this card with a title defense against Tony Ferguson. Instead, he is in his native Dagestan, the Russian Republic, where pandemic-related travel restrictions prevent him from leaving.
Nurmagomedov and Ferguson have now been scheduled to fight five different times, with each bout canceled for progressively extreme reasons — injuries, illness and now a global outbreak. Ferguson has accused Nurmagomedov of deliberately avoiding a U.F.C. 249 showdown, but the promotion company’s president, Dana White, insists that the champion was ready for this fight and simply got marooned in Dagestan, while the U.F.C. scrambled to find a location and work out other logistics for Saturday’s card.
“The world was literally changing by the day,” White said in a recent interview with BT Sport. “We had all made some bad decisions that got him stuck in Moscow.” White added: “I take responsibility for that, too. It happened.”
For his part, Nurmagomedov awaits the winner of Saturday’s main event, and says he will be prepared to fight after Ramadan, which ends May 23.
“It was the best training camp,” he wrote in a recent Instagram post, referring to his preparation for the Ferguson bout. “I haven’t felt myself that good for a while.”
He pledged to “come back even better.”
Where is Conor McGregor?
Conor McGregor, the U.F.C.’s biggest pay-per-view attraction, has been at home in Ireland, where he will watch Saturday’s card to size up future opponents and judge how the sport is organized amid the pandemic.
This week, McGregor’s manager, Audie Attar, told ESPN that the fighter prefers to perform before large crowds but understands that is unrealistic right now.
McGregor, 31, last competed in January, when he dispatched Donald Cerrone in just 40 seconds. That bout was McGregor’s first since losing a title fight with Khabib Nurmagomedov in October 2018. It reestablished him as the U.F.C.’s biggest attraction, both for fans, who relish high-impact action, and potential opponents, who know a McGregor match means big money. Immediately after the Cerrone fight, Dana White spoke of a blockbuster rematch between McGregor and Nurmagomedov to come in 2020. McGregor has also emerged as a potential opponent for the winner of Saturday’s main event between Ferguson and Gaethje."

The trend has been moving in a positive direction: Over the past decade, far more workers who are eligible for Social Security have been waiting to file, often substantially increasing their lifetime annual benefits.
But the stunning job losses in the pandemic-induced economic crisis could bring this trend to a crashing halt, as suddenly unemployed older workers without substantial savings scramble to meet living expenses.
At a time when fewer retired households can rely on traditional pensions and only about half own retirement accounts, Social Security is the most important benefit for most Americans. Even in good times, there is no simple, one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to timing a claim — your longevity, savings and any other pension income are important factors.
Now the decision is complicated by the highly uncertain outlook for the economy, jobs and financial markets. But even if you need Social Security income immediately, you may have options worth considering that can boost lifetime benefits.
Let’s review the pros and cons of different strategies for claiming benefits during the coronavirus pandemic.
I need income now. Why wait to claim Social Security?Your claiming age matters a great deal. You can file as early as 62, but your annual benefit will be higher for every year you wait, until 70.
Social Security uses an actuarial formula tied to your full retirement age — the point at which you can claim 100 percent of the benefit you’ve earned over the course of your working life. For example, if you turn 62 this year, your full retirement age is 66 and 8 months.
If you file before your full age, your benefit will be reduced as much as 6.7 percent annually, depending on when you claim. The bite is bigger than in the past because of changes enacted in 1983, when a gradual increase in the full retirement age from 65 to 67 was set in motion. Those increases, which still are being phased in, effectively set the bar higher for claiming a full benefit.
Filing at 62 this year means you’ll receive 72 percent of your full benefit, noted Richard W. Johnson, director of the program on retirement policy at the Urban Institute, compared with 80 percent for someone who was born in 1937 or earlier and retired at that age (when the full age was still 65).
“That lower income can really sting when you reach your 80s and out-of-pocket medical expenses and spending on home and residential care often surge,” Mr. Johnson said.
Filing after your full retirement age yields an even larger increase: 8 percent for every 12 months of delay up to age 70. That’s a much higher guaranteed return than you could get in any financial instrument, and benefits are adjusted annually for inflation.
Even a delay of a year or two past the full age can meaningfully increase benefits and mitigate your risk of falling short of income in retirement.
“Delaying your Social Security claim is the optimal strategy for anyone who is reasonably healthy and likely to live beyond the average longevity of an American,” said Michael Finke, a professor at the American College of Financial Services.
During the 2008 recession, early claiming jumped as large numbers of workers were forced to retire, Mr. Johnson said. But the trend has shifted decisively since then: For example, the share of people claiming at 62 fell to 35 percent in 2018 from 53 percent in 2009.
That positive trend now seems likely to stall or even reverse, Mr. Johnson said.“A lot of older people losing jobs now are going to be unemployed for a long time, and my fear is that many of them are never going to work again,” he said. “They’re going to end up taking Social Security and dipping into their retirement accounts earlier than expected, and that is going to have serious consequences for their economic security at age 70 and 80.”
I have some savings. Should I live on that rather than claim Social Security now?This is a very personal decision that depends greatly on your circumstances. Maintaining an emergency fund is always important, and never more so than during times of economic volatility. But people with very substantial savings can draw down safely to cover living expenses while delaying their claim.
The loss of earned income means you will be in a lower tax bracket, and rates are at historically low levels under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.
“There’s no better time to take money out of a 401(k) or I.R.A. than when your income is relatively low and you have a lower marginal tax rate,” Mr. Finke said.
A delay of just a few years can be very beneficial. A 62-year-old with a full retirement age benefit of $1,500 would increase her likely lifetime benefits by more than $100,000 by waiting until that point to file, according to a projection by William Meyer, a co-founder of Social Security Solutions, which offers software aimed at helping retirees make optimal claiming decisions. Mr. Meyer’s calculation assumes that our retiree lives to 90 and that Social Security’s cost-of-living adjustment is 2 percent each year.
But the pandemic has added a new dimension to claiming decisions for most retirees, the retirement researcher Dirk Cotton said. Since most Americans have modest savings, if any, many of them will need to hang on to what they have.
“I know that I can either get Social Security income now, or shift some of it to the future if I think I might need it more later than I do today,” he said. “But the question now is whether the pandemic has changed our thinking enough about the future to affect that decision, and the answer is, ‘Absolutely, yes.’”
For example, the future economic security of adult children might favor an early Social Security claim over drawing down savings now, Mr. Cotton argued.
“What if your children have jobs that now are gone or hanging by a thread?” he asked. “You’re going to want to have assets available to help them.”
Persistent bear market conditions also present an argument in favor of an early claim, Mr. Cotton added.
“Can you count on your portfolio to generate the kind of income you had expected earlier?” he asked. “If the market is dropping, you may have to sell off more of your portfolio each year than you had expected, but claiming early Social Security would relieve some of that pressure.”
I don’t have anything saved. What should I do?Your options are limited here, but there are moves that may get some Social Security income flowing now while preserving the possibility of higher benefits later.
One strategy is to claim benefits now but suspend them later to accumulate what are known as delayed retirement credits. Let’s say our out-of-work 62-year-old claimant finds a new job at 64. When she reaches her full retirement age, she could suspend her benefits and begin accruing delayed credits, calculated from her already reduced benefit. Doing so would add roughly $50,000 to her lifetime benefit, Mr. Meyer said. And if she waits until 63 to make her initial filing and then executes this suspend strategy, the addition to her likely lifetime payout will rise to about $71,000.
“You can only suspend once, but it does add an element of flexibility that can result in more cumulative benefits,” Mr. Meyer said.
People who gain new employment while receiving Social Security should be aware of one complication here. It’s called the retirement earnings test.
If you claim benefits before your full retirement age and keep working, Social Security withholds a portion of your benefits if your earnings exceed certain amounts, a figure known as the exempt amount. (For 2020, the exempt amount is $18,240; for people attaining full retirement this year, the exempt amount is $48,600, applied only to earnings in months before the month of full retirement age attainment.)
Social Security withholds $1 in benefits for every $2 of earnings in excess of the exempt amount. But the reduced benefits are not lost permanently. When you reach your full retirement age, your monthly benefit will be increased permanently to account for the months when benefits were withheld.
Married couples have an important additional option for increasing their household benefit: One spouse claims early while the other delays. Consider a couple in which one spouse is 66 and the other 63. The older spouse has a full retirement benefit of $2,400, and the younger spouse can expect a full benefit of $1,500.
Mr. Meyer calculates that if both file now rather than at full retirement age, they forgo as much at $59,000 in lifetime benefits, and $275,000 compared with delaying to age 70. If the younger, lower-earning spouse is laid off and starts benefits now but the older, higher-earning spouse delays starting benefits until 70, they will have $170,000 more in benefits than if they both start benefits right away.
How does my longevity figure into this?This question underscores an important caveat accompanying Mr. Meyer’s projections, which assume a life span to 90: Not only may your mileage vary — it certainly will. Financial advisers routinely illustrate outcomes assuming long life spans as a way to test the retirement plans they draw up.
Men who reach 65 have a 33 percent chance of living to 90, and women a 44 percent chance, according to the Society of Actuaries. And for married couples, there’s a 63 percent chance that one spouse will live to at least 90. Yet a recent study by the society found that half of us wrongly estimate our life expectancy by five or more years, with 23 percent overestimating and 28 percent underestimating.
Those numbers illustrate the classic argument for Social Security’s value as insurance against outliving our financial resources. But the challenges of the pandemic economy may turn that argument on its head.
“Sometimes an economic analysis points to what seems like a good decision for a large group of people,” Mr. Cotton said. “Economics can tell you what’s best for an entire group of people — but you’re one person. It’s something you need to decide on your own.”
How do I determine my benefit amount and file?If you have an account on the Social Security website, you can download your personal statement of benefits, which includes your estimated benefit amount at various ages. The statement also includes your lifetime wage history; check this to make sure it looks accurate. If you haven’t established an account yet, you can do that at any time; it’s useful to have one, since Social Security mails out paper statements only periodically these days.
The Social Security field offices are closed to the public for most routine transactions during the pandemic. If you want to claim benefits now, filing online will be your most convenient option. Services are also available via the agency’s toll-free line, 800-772-1213, but be prepared for long delays."

The little girl, her black curls tumbling over her eyes and her slight frame uncomfortably splayed out on the airplane seat, hid crayons in her armpits the entire flight. She was puzzled how they, like the new people called Mom and Dad sitting next to her, now belonged to her.
Her new parents, Seth and Meg Mosier, looked to each other. Were they doing things right? It was not their first emergency evacuation — they had escaped war and violence before — but it was their first on a one-way flight from India sponsored by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. And certainly their first with a little girl they had just adopted as a deadly pandemic swirled around the world.
In 2008, Seth, an American diplomat, was ordered to evacuate from the embassy in Tbilisi, Georgia, when the Russian military invaded. Meg drove a car filled with diplomats across the border and into the safety of Armenia. In 2011, the Arab Spring protests forced them to leave Egypt.
Yet here they were, singing “The Star-Spangled Banner” with dozens of young missionaries in suits next to a child who kept stuffing crayons under her arms and who clung to Meg as if her life depended on it.
This was not the way the Mosiers had envisioned starting a family.Seth, 41, with a dirty blond crew cut and a perpetually earnest look on his face, and Meg, 42, with freckles, a short brunette bob and a determination to always stay positive, decided to settle down after they left Cairo. They tried to get pregnant for five years and then, after two rounds of in vitro fertilization that cost $27,000, they started the adoption process in the summer of 2018.
Instead of the excitement of doctor checkups and ultrasounds, they got reams of adoption red tape. They looked into adopting an American child, but the agency told them they may be seen as too old. They considered Georgia, but were nervous about the prevalence of developmental disorders in orphanages there. Eventually, they settled on India, which has an easier process than most countries.
After weeks of filling out monotonous paperwork, they were directed to an orphanage in Madurai, a city in southern India. The orphanage gave them a name: a little girl named Selvi.
Last December, when they had their first video chat with her, they struggled to hold her attention. Selvi was more interested in her caregiver than the strangers cooing at her through a screen 8,000 miles away.
Less than three months later, the first coronavirus case in Delhi was announced on March 2, a day before the adoption was approved. Countries around the world started closing their borders to stem the virus’ spread; and the Mosiers thought their opportunity to build a family was disappearing.
They booked tickets to Madurai for March 12, four days before their meeting with Selvi. Madurai is an ancient city crammed with rickshaws, street hawkers and low-slung buildings, punctuated by its famous giant Hindu temples. They did some sightseeing, to get a sense of Selvi’s home, but couldn’t shake their anxiety.
“We were all nerves,” Seth said. “All we wanted was for her to like us, but we worried she would take one look at Meg and I and be terrified.”
Just 20 hours after the Mosiers arrived, India sealed its borders, canceling all unused visas and barring entry to foreigners. Indian news outlets reported that the government planned to suspend all international flights.
Now all they needed to do was meet their daughter and get out in time. They worried about being stranded for months in a country they barely knew during a global crisis. The bonding process was never going to be easy, but now they had to speed it up. The first day with Selvi, she clung to her caregiver, an orphanage employee assigned to raise her since she was an infant.
Meg sat on the floor with Selvi, second-guessing her every move. Was she captivating enough? Could she bond with the little girl the way the caregiver did? She had spent every moment leading up to the adoption thinking about the caregiver, waves of jealousy washing over her.
“But when I met her, all I felt was gratitude,” Meg said. “We missed out on those first two years of Selvi’s life. We wished it had been us who were her parents from the start, but we weren’t. Selvi had been in good hands.”
Every time the caregiver left the room, the little girl cried. When Selvi bumped her head on a stair and started wailing, Meg and Seth froze. The caregiver, who did not speak English, mimed a child being cradled to Seth and then darted out of the room while Seth tried to soothe the wriggling child.
“It was so scary. There was so much weight behind this, so many moments dedicated to thinking about this moment,” Meg said. “You want her to like you so badly, you want to just know what to do and how to do it, to do right by her.”
After 45 minutes of rocking, Selvi fell asleep on Seth’s shoulder.The next day, the Mosiers could finally take Selvi home. The orphanage staff planned an elaborate handover ceremony, stuffing Selvi into a giant, frilly blue dress with a fat pink bow. An overzealous photographer choreographed the moment, but only captured strained smiles and awkward formality. For his final shot, he had Meg hold Selvi, who started screaming and clawing for her caregiver.
“I felt so much empathy for her in that moment,” Meg said of the caregiver. “She had raised her for the first two years of her life.”
Through tears, Meg thanked the caregiver and promised to make her an important part of Selvi’s life. Today Meg and Seth show Selvi three photos to explain her transition: one of Selvi and the caregiver, one of the four of them together and one of their new, three-person family.
They flew several hours to Delhi on March 18. The next day, India announced that all flights in and out of the country would be canceled in three days. They had two days to finalize an international adoption.
The final paperwork — Selvi’s U.S. immigration visa and Indian medical forms — usually take a week. But bureaucrats from both countries rushed to finish it in two days before their window disappeared. Just hours before the airport closed, the Mosiers checked in and went through customs. But they had forgotten one crucial piece of paper: an exit stamp allowing Selvi to leave the country.
They were stuck in India with few hotels still open. Then the Indian government announced one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. India’s 1.3 billion people were told not to leave their homes, except to buy food or medicine. The Indian police, always quick to use violence, have beaten civilians found on the streets, even stuck foreign tourists, trying to buy food.
The Mosiers checked themselves into a fancy hotel now empty of guests after massive evacuation efforts by various governments. The hotel felt deserted and sad, with only 10 of its nearly 500 rooms occupied. The handful of toys they had brought began to look painfully thin as the days passed. The crayons would disappear into Selvi’s armpits. It’s not clear why she did this, but some orphans hide toys because they don’t have their own.
They spent the next nine days playing hide and go seek with bored bellhops and the hotel manager. Meg tried to teach Selvi a little bit of English: spoon, flower, bed.
“So many people told us we were the bright spot in their day. The staff were all sleeping at the hotel, scared — and hated being separated from their families. Selvi drew so much light to them,” Meg said.
The U.S. Embassy was flooded with requests from thousands of Americans wanting to leave India, but there was a holdup with the flights that dragged on for days. Finally, they got an email saying the Latter-day Saints had chartered a flight to evacuate their missionaries. They offered the unoccupied seats to the embassy, which offered them to the Mosiers.
At the embassy, the Mosiers and a few dozen missionaries — barely out of high school — waited for their flight. One of them, Sam McGuire, 18, told them that he had been adopted as an infant from an orphanage in the eastern city of Kolkata by Latter-day Saints living near Salt Lake City.
Sam had spent eight months in southern India and had started inquiring about his birth mother when the coronavirus outbreak cut short his mission.
“I was really happy when I saw them,” Sam said later, about the Mosiers, “to talk and share my experience with them.”
Sam said he often lies awake at night, thinking about how different his life would be if he had never been adopted. Would he be an auto-rickshaw driver? A farmhand?
“I know what my circumstances could have turned out to be, what happens in orphanages when children grow older. People don’t want them,” he said. He was struck by the Mosiers deep love for Selvi. “They will give her a life no others can,” he said.
Meeting the young missionary eased the Mosiers’ biggest worry: that Selvi might feel she never truly belonged with Seth and Meg, because they were a different race.
“Here was this kid, born in India, adopted by Mormon parents, who grew up in the U.S. and came back to see what happened to him, where his story began, 16 years before,” Seth said. “It made us feel like everything would be all right.”
Eventually everyone piled into buses to head to the airport. Sam grabbed his bag and looked up at the Mosiers. “Goodbye, kid,” he said to Selvi. “You’re going to have a great life.”
The Mosiers are now back in Bethesda, Md., where the governor has ordered an extended lockdown. They haven’t introduced Selvi to friends or family yet because of the lockdown, which they said was a blessing that allowed them to bond with their new daughter. Meals have been difficult. Selvi does not like American food and so Seth has been researching Indian curry recipes online.
“I’ve spent a lot of time perfecting a potato masala,” Seth said.And the crayons? Selvi now leaves them lying around the house. “She knows,” Meg said, “what’s ours is hers.”

Want more basketball in your inbox? Sign up for Marc Stein’s weekly N.B.A. newsletter here.Firm predictions about the fate of professional sports leagues continue to be futile in the midst of a global pandemic.
What N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver has proclaimed to be “the single greatest challenge” the league has ever faced remains its most fluid challenge, too.
Early in his conference call Friday night with the N.B.A. Players Association, Silver did say, “Since we stopped the season, the goal has been to restart the season.” Yet it is still only a goal, two months into the suspension of play, in part because no one — not even Silver — is sure whether the league can stay back, so to speak, once it comes back.
“No decision we make will be risk-free,” Silver told the players, according to a recording of the teleconference reviewed by The New York Times. “We’re going to be living with this virus for the foreseeable future.”
Imagine a rebooted N.B.A. season in July or August. Playing on in the face of new positive tests, player trepidation, gloomy forecasts about a second wave of infections, criticism from countless external forces and the inevitable obstacles we can’t even pinpoint yet — it all looms as deeply daunting stuff.
Sean Doolittle of the Washington Nationals may as well have been speaking for several of his N.B.A. counterparts on Monday when he unleashed a 16-tweet thread to publicly question what Major League Baseball has planned in terms of “protections for players, families, staff, stadium workers and the work force it would require to resume a season.”
The N.B.A., mind you, is not without hope. There has been some real progress in the testing arena, starting with the Orlando Magic’s ability to secure clearance last week from local health officials and the league to test asymptomatic players and staff members. With the Lakers and Clippers also expected to soon receive similar blessings in Los Angeles, Orlando’s breakthrough makes it somewhat easier to imagine the N.B.A. reaching a point in coming weeks where all 30 teams can administer tests freely without worrying about taking tests from needier segments of the public.
A far thornier issue for Silver, in his contact sport, figures to be answering the array of health-and-safety questions akin to those Doolittle so forcefully posed to M.L.B.’s elders. Perhaps the resistance is not universal, but there are surely N.B.A. players apprehensive about returning. The question-and-answer session of Silver’s call began and ended with complaints from Oklahoma City’s Chris Paul and the Nets’ Kyrie Irving that some of their peers already feel pressure to return to team practice facilities for individual workouts in what surely rank as the most sanitized gyms on Earth at the moment — even though only two teams (Cleveland and Portland) had opened their practice facilities at the time of the call.
“It’s an issue employers everywhere are going to have to confront,” Michele Roberts, the union’s executive director, told ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne last week. “Because I guarantee there’s going to be at least one player, if not many more than that, that are going to have genuine concerns about their safety.”
Silver does not want to apply pressure. He made it clear to his Friday audience that, while there can be no such thing as a risk-free return without a coronavirus vaccine, players cannot be forced back to work by team owners or the league office.
“We’re not going to make any decisions that aren’t joint,” Silver told them.As I’ve been advising for weeks, keep your eye on Germany as a possible preview of what awaits Silver’s league this summer. Bundesliga soccer isn’t N.B.A. basketball, but the Bundesliga is a league of global stature and poised to return to operations this weekend with what it calls “ghost games” — matches without fans.
The Bundesliga approach calls for any player or team staff member who tests positive to be quarantined for 14 days — while the rest of the group carries on.
Could that sort of protocol work on these shores? Would N.B.A. players really stomach the idea of showing up for the next day’s practice or game after a teammate or two was forced into quarantine? Are teams in North America, and their fans, prepared to accept the possibility that a star player will be forced to leave the team for up to two weeks in the middle of the playoffs as if he had sustained a more common injury? Are the star player’s teammates going to be willing to play without him?
Do we dare limit our focus to those sufficiently unsettling questions without asking: What if someone dies?
We don’t have any detailed answers yet. Nor, frankly, do the German soccer authorities, who are at least two months ahead of the N.B.A. Dynamo Dresden, in the Bundesliga’s second tier, will not return to the field this weekend as scheduled, because local health authorities demanded that the entire team be quarantined after two new coronavirus cases, overruling the league officials who would merely have isolated the individuals who had tested positive.
So we repeat: Coming back is one thing. Staying back is another entirely.There is no mystery, by contrast, about the forces behind the push for a conclusion to the 2019-20 season. Nearly 80 percent of the 82-game schedule was completed before play was suspended, but crowning a champion, as the N.B.A. has managed to do in each of its previous 73 seasons, is a secondary aim at this point.
It’s a money thing as much as anything.Silver told players that game-night income from fans accounts for roughly 40 percent of the league’s annual revenue, drawing focus to concerns about the financial consequences of a canceled season — how that would affect the salary cap, free agency, future earnings and the very existence of the current collective bargaining agreement. The gravity of Silver’s statement, with no one in the league expecting to see fans in its buildings before 2021 at the earliest, needed little elaboration.
Yet the money vs. safety calculus is as tricky as it gets. Critics will say that the N.B.A. is irresponsible in hurrying to come back before there is a significant medical development to combat the coronavirus. Defenders will counter by pointing out that there’s little benefit to waiting for a comeback when the conditions may be no more favorable in the winter than they are in the summer or fall.
Silver stressed to the players that no decisions have to be made before June 1 — that there’s still time — but the clock’s ticking will surely get a lot louder for everyone the closer we get to July.
The math will have to get done at some point. The lone comfort for the players is that they will have a louder voice than usual.
The very personal assessment involved in deciding “how much risk we’re all comfortable taking,” as Silver put it, was nobody’s idea of player empowerment when the season started. But here we are.

Corner Three
You ask; I answer. Every week in this space, I’ll field three questions posed via email at marcstein-newsletter@nytimes.com. Please include your first and last name, as well as the city you’re writing in from, and make sure “Corner Three” is in the subject line. (Responses may be condensed and lightly edited for clarity.)
Q: I’m so confused as to why a non-playoff team with nothing to play for would open their doors. Can anyone explain this? — @joey_buckets3 from Twitter
Stein: The Cleveland Cavaliers aren’t going to the playoffs even if the N.B.A. manages to restart its 2019-20 season. Yet the Cavs were the first franchise to welcome players back Friday when teams in states where shelter-in-place restrictions have been eased were allowed to unlock their practice facilities.
One of the best explanations came from Cleveland’s Larry Nance Jr. After spending about 90 minutes Friday lifting weights and partaking in some catch-and-shoot drills, Nance said, “It was more for mental health than physical, to be honest with you.”
Allowing players to return to the gym, even if teams are initially limited to a maximum of four players inside at any time, is the first step back toward normalcy for athletes whose lives have been disrupted like never before by the coronavirus. It’s also a matter of safety. League and team officials think it’s wisest to make their own facilities available to discourage players from seeking out unauthorized gyms that aren’t sanitized to the same standard.
But there are other good reasons. The N.B.A., for starters, has made it clear that it hopes to resume play with a few regular-season games involving all 30 teams, not just those who were playoff-bound when play was halted March 11.
Another one: As we’ve discussed in the newsletter previously, many N.B.A. athletic training staffs would want to give their players up to six weeks’ worth of supervised prep time before games restarted after such a long layoff. The more likely scenario is a ramp-up period closer to three weeks to give the league as much of the summer as possible to complete as much of the remaining schedule as it can.
From a league perspective, by making facilities available to players well before teams officially reconvene, it can assert that players have been provided a theoretical head start on the road to getting back into basketball shape to compensate for the potential forthcoming crunch.
Q: Why do league rules prohibit teams from buying these hoops? — @NateAllard from TwitterStein: Nate’s question comes in response to my recent piece with Scott Cacciola on the reality that many N.B.A. players, counterintuitive as it sounds, do not have a basket at home and thus have struggled to get shots up during a suspension of play that hit the two-month mark on Monday.
In March, the league informed teams that furnishing players with “individual workout equipment of a modest cost” was permissible. But buying a hoop, they were told, would be considered salary-cap circumvention.
The list of approved equipment for teams to supply includes workout mats, workout balls, resistance bands and “modest” free-weight sets. Paying for the delivery of boxed meals to players is also allowed.
Q: Great memories from that Knicks-Lakers Game 7 in 1970. I, too, was there as a 13-year-old, like Spike Lee, and went with my friend, whose father had tickets in Section 106. A reporter from Los Angeles, Bud Furillo, helped us get some autographs. I recognize Donnie May and Mike Riordan in the main photo that ran with your story, but who is the player on the right? — Paul Winston
Stein: Leaping in the air in that photo, in celebration, was Cazzie Russell. We initially had the photo captioned improperly last week, but the error was quickly spotted by a few Knicks die-hards who wrote in — like Morton Frank of Redwood City, Calif.
As Mr. Frank put it, “Cazzie’s Adidas sneakers and comparatively low socks” are clear giveaways for some fans. “To this day, I can give you the same detail and trivia on the whole team,” he wrote. “To love the old Knicks is to love them all the way.”
I really enjoyed talking to Spike and Marv Albert (and our own Harvey Araton) to learn more about that team and that series, because I certainly wasn’t consuming any of it as a 1-year-old.
It’s always bothered me that history doesn’t get passed down with the same vigor in basketball as it does in baseball, which has sparked me in adulthood to embrace every opportunity to find out more about the long-overlooked 1970s, which was a period of great struggle for the sport.
For Knicks fans especially, Friday’s 50th anniversary of the win that clinched the first title in franchise history was a welcome respite, since this season was otherwise destined to be remembered for the curiously timed ousters of David Fizdale and Steve Mills; James L. Dolan’s shabby treatment of Lee; and multiple instances in which the sad state of the franchise inspired loud “Sell the Team” chants.

Numbers Game
4With 36 points and 19 assists in the Knicks’ Game 7 triumph over the Los Angeles Lakers in the 1970 N.B.A. finals, Walt Frazier is one of only four players in league history to post at least 20 points and 10 assists in a Game 7 of the league’s championship series, according to Basketball Reference. The others:Jerry West (42 points, 12 assists and 13 rebounds in the Lakers’ Game 7 loss to Boston in 1969)James Worthy (36 points, 10 assists and 16 rebounds in the Lakers’ Game 7 victory over Detroit in 1988)LeBron James (27 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds in Cleveland’s Game 7 win at Golden State in 2016 to complete the Cavaliers’ comeback from a 3-1 series deficit against the 73-win Warriors)12For all the attention Willis Reed’s thigh injury in the 1970 finals understandably still gets, we can’t forget that knee surgery limited the Lakers’ Wilt Chamberlain to a career-low 12 games during the regular season. Chamberlain played the final three regular-season games after a four-month absence and then appeared in 18 games that postseason for the Lakers, averaging 22.1 points and 22.2 rebounds.
9Michael Jordan lost nine of his first 10 N.B.A. playoff games with the Chicago Bulls. Jordan led the Bulls to a playoff mark of 95-31 in winning six championships between 1991 and 1998, although he missed the 1993-94 N.B.A. season while playing Class AA baseball for the Birmingham Barons.
2With Jordan in uniform, Chicago was pushed to only two Game 7s in the 1990s and won both, outlasting the Knicks in the 1992 Eastern Conference semifinals and defeating Indiana in the 1998 Eastern Conference finals.
99.1The N.B.A. has instructed teams to refuse admittance to practice facilities for anyone who registers a temperature higher than 99.1 degrees. The threshold was 99.5 degrees for Taiwan’s Super Basketball League when it checked players as they entered the HaoYu Basketball Training Center during the S.B.L.’s recent playoffs.

For this week’s roundup of student comments on our writing prompts, we asked teenagers to tell us about acts of kindness they have observed since the onset of the coronavirus. We also wanted to know how their internet habits have changed and where they would like to be stranded during the pandemic.
We’d like to give a warm welcome to the new students who joined the conversation this week from: Aurora, Ill.; Bethesda, Md.; Cambria School of Excellence; Camdenton, Mo.; Carbondale, Colo.; Desplaine, Ill.; El Paso, Tex.; Ella T. Grasso Southeastern Technical High School, Conn.; Eugene, Ore.; Gladeville Middle School; Healy, Alaska; Hopkinton, N.H.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Lake of the Ozarks, Mo.; Larchmont, N.Y.; Lovettsville, Va.; Marblehead, Mass.; Marlborough, Mass.; Middleton, Mass.; Springfield, Ore.; Stratford, Conn.; Utah and Valencia High School. 
Please note: Student comments have been lightly edited for length, but otherwise appear as they were originally submitted.
_________What Acts of Kindness Have You Heard About or Participated In During Coronavirus?
While the current crisis has brought lots of stress, grief and uncertainty into our lives, it has also led to acts of kindness, generosity and solidarity. 
We asked students what acts of selflessness they have witnessed. They told us about the ways, big and small, they and other have been making an impact in their communities.
Making masksOne act of kindness that I’ve been participating in is making masks with my mom and selling them to people for very low prices. We go to stores and buy certain fabrics and materials either with designs or no designs and make them into beautiful masks. Recently we’ve been selling them to workers and they have said some very nice comments towards the masks and our dedication to helping people. Another thing I do is deliver the masks to people around our neighborhood that can’t go outside so I just suit up put on my mask and gloves and head out and I can say that this has brought much joy to me especially when I know that I’m using my time well and not sitting around playing video games all day.— jose Martinez, Desplaine Illinois
I’ve heard of many people sewing masks out of their materials and decontaminating them. They then can safely distribute them to people in their community to use less surgical masks that are in high demand and needed in hospitals. I think this is useful because it can also encourage people who may be sick to wear masks while they are out while simultaneously saving resources that are needed by health care workers. It’s something people can do in the safety of their homes to help their community.— Kathleen S., J.R. Masterman
Cooking for othersMy mom works for the hospital and I have been volunteering to help with “Meals for Heroes” that is sponsored by the Greater Wilmington Business Journal and New Hanover Regional Medical Center. Different businesses are providing 100 meals per day, to the front line workers at the hospital. I have been helping hand out the meals to the hospital staff as they drive down “Gratitude Lane.”— Daniel Guy, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC
Throughout the coronavirus outbreak, my mom and I have cooked numerous dishes for older people we know. We made lasagna, cake, soup, various treats, vegetable plates, and more. We do so to promote them to quarantine and eliminate any reason for them to leave the house. My mom also buys groceries for her parents and older friends. I try to lighten up my grandparents by calling them. I do other types of community service within my girl scout troop, including fundraisers, making blankets and for animals in shelters, and caroling to elders. On our own, my mom and I hand out water and granola bars to homeless people. The quote “it’s better to give than to receive” does have some truth. If you are in a place to give, then give, so someone in need gets help.— Isadora Monteith, J.R. Masterman
Donation effortsAs the world is going through a pandemic, our school decided to send a care package to three different hospitals in South Korea (that is where I live). We donated snacks, drinks, shampoo, soap and handmade cards. I am also growing my hair so I can donate it to make wigs for children with cancer. During easter our family and some other people brought masks and gave it to others in need.— Allison Go, South Korea
Recently, my sister and I realized that our bookcases were full of books we had not read in years, either because we had already read them, or because they were children’s books. With all the free time we had over the weekend, we decided to sort through our books and decide which ones to donate. We each ended up with huge piles of books, and we organized them into categories. At this point, we could have donated all of the books to some organization. However, we wanted to know exactly where our books were going so we could feel the effect of the deed more. My mom posted pictures of all of our books on the “Moms of New Rochelle” Facebook group with the caption “free books.” She instantly began receiving messages from mothers who said their children were running out of books to read since the libraries are now closed. We messaged back and forth with some of the mothers, suggesting books for their children based on their ages and interests. Every mother expressed gratitude; one even asked how she could repay us, telling us she could send us gloves if we wanted. We refused, partly because we did not need gloves, but also partly because the good feeling we got from doing the deed was sufficient pay.— Daviel Schulman, New Rochelle, NY
VolunteeringDuring the coronavirus epidemic my church has supported homeless people by giving them food and items like a mask, hand sanitizer, and blankets to stay safe. Homeless people right now need as much help as possible to stay healthy during the pandemic. They don’t have the money or the resources to stay afloat. I believe with everything that my church does can help them.— Izel, J.R. Masterman
Since I can remember, my family’s value system has been based on volunteering and helping others. I don’t remember a season where my temple congregation was running an annual charity drive that my family did not help execute. Throughout my life I have renovated parks, run food donation trips, and organized clothing drives. Not only were these roles expected of me, it felt natural to spend my time giving to others. During the high holidays, I had the opportunity to donate over 500 bags of food to our local food kitchen with my youth group. Giving to others helped me realize that life was much bigger than what was right in front of me. The action of providing help, health and happiness to others filled me with a joy I had never experienced. I am lucky enough to be able to give onto others and it is one of the most valuable gifts one can achieve. — Hayden Roberge, New Rochelle, NY
One of my friends has an upcoming Bar Mitzvah. Many kids do a mitzvah protect for their Bar/Bat Mitzvah. A mitzvah project is a project that helps other people. My friend chose to do his at the Jewish Relief Agency (JRA). At the JRA, once a month, people come to a warehouse and help pack boxes with food. Then people deliver the boxes to people who need the food. I often went to help him pack and deliver boxes with him. I think that the act was incredibly beneficial to me because It helped me realize how many people need help in this world. This experience was also really fun. That made me realize that helping others can be as exciting for you as it is for the person you are helping sometimes— Jonah Smith Posner, J.R. Masterman
Small, but meaningful, gestures I haven’t really been able to do too many things for people other than texting and calling people to let them know I’ve been thinking of them. I have been trying to make an effort to talk to people I don’t normally talk with, just offering a fun conversation to distract from the world. An act I have experienced is people I don’t normally talk to reaching out to talk to me, and that meant a lot, and that is what inspired me to start doing the same.— Jamie, Healy, AK
Sometime last week, my friends and their parents got together and invited our neighborhood to put up lights on each of their houses. My family put up a sign in one of our windows that reads “HOPE” in colorful light, and I’ve seen other houses use this invitation very creatively. Throughout this pandemic, there can still be ways to illuminate the world with our goodness, even if it’s from a distance.— Kaycia B., NUAMES High School, Layton UT
I heard about people thanking garbage collectors for their work during such difficult time. A few words can go a long way, and many of these kind verbal acts have had positive impacts on these people. Even if you don’t have money to donate, it’s completely free to thank someone for the difficult work they’re doing in such times. Those people are putting their lives at risk for us, so it’s the least we can do.— Saharsh Satheesh, Collierville High School, Tennessee
In a dire time like this, keeping in touch and helping others really matters. This pandemic really pushes us to aid the ones we love to keep them safe, and talk to the people we truly care about to not loose communication in this month of isolation. My family has been sending food and puzzles to my grandparents to keep them busy and so they don’t have to go to the store as it can be dangerous for them especially. Acts of kindness towards others are very meaningful now more than ever.— Autumn Klein, Glenbard West, Glen Ellyn, IL
I’ve been hearing from my grandma that people in her community are dropping groceries at her door so she doesn’t have to go to the supermarket. These acts of kindness, which I hear are happening throughout her town, give me hope that communities will come together in these trying times. I am grateful to anyone helping the elderly right now, as they are especially vulnerable to the virus, and really cannot afford to leave their homes even for groceries.— Madeline Fox, Pennington NJ
_________How Has the Coronavirus Changed How You Use the Internet?
As the coronavirus rages, homebound students are spending increasingly more time online and so we asked students about how their internet habits have changed.
Reflecting on their hyper-digital lives, many students were dismayed by the quantity and quality of their screen time and its impact on their physical, mental and emotional health. Some, however, have seized the opportunity to forge new intellectual, civic and social connections, trying to thrive amid an ongoing crisis.
Spending much more time on the internetThe internet has turned from something that I used for entertainment and to help complete schoolwork into what my life revolves around. If I have to do school work, it’s through the internet. If I want to stay in touch with my friends, it’s through the internet. If I want to access anything outside of my home, it’s through the internet. Consequently, the time I’m spending on the internet has grown significantly since the start of quarantine. This has been frustrating because of the lack of face-to-face interaction with anyone aside from my family and exercising becoming more difficult, but it has also opened up new methods in which I can connect with my friends. Because my best friend and I can no longer see one another in person, we’ve begun playing more video games together and have been bonding that way. One of our other friends had their birthday during quarantine and we had a Zoom call to celebrate which we would have never done before. — Sam McNamara, John T. Hoggard High (Wilmington, NC)
Since my school closed originally on March 13th for two weeks, now the rest of the school year, I have been using my phone a lot more than I would in normal circumstances. I used to use my phone 2-3 hours a day but know, my daily average is around 10-12 hours, even up to 15 hours a day. I have been trying to cut down on my daily screen time but it is really hard because I have nothing else to fill my days except for it. Some of my friends are still saying they have been able to keep there screen time down to 5 hours a day and I am like how is that possible? Hopefully, I’ll be able to lower my screen time once online school starts up.—Ryan Altschuler, J.R Masterman School
Binge watchingMy screentime has grown to 8 hours per day which is 6 hours more than it used to before school closed. I am using the Internet more than I ever have. I spend most of that time on Netflix where I have been binging TV shows like Money Heist, Ozark, and Tiger King. I would usually watch the Sixers game every time they play but now there are only live streams NBA stars playing H.O.R.S.E. — Leonard Vekker, J.R. Masterman PA
The Coronavirus has greatly impacted how much time I spend on the internet. My computer is my main source for schoolwork and entertainment. On my computer, I complete all my assignments and watch movies. My most time engaging app is Netflix. I have started binge watching all my favorite shows during all this free time. I read in an article that due to everyone staying home, Netflix’s memberships have doubled. One con towards all this screen time is that it causes many headaches. I spend every day staring at my screen that my head starts to hurt. This is where I take some time to go outside and enjoy the nice weather.— Yahaira H, Cass High School, Georgia
Going to school onlineThe coronavirus has definitely changed the way I use the internet. It has effected me the most in school. I spend about 2-4 hours a day doing online work or video conferences. In some ways online school is better. For example my math teacher post videos of her doing the lesson. Now I am able to go at my own pace, I can pause if I need or re watch something I didn’t understand. 
On the other hand I feel overwhelmed with the amount of work I’ve been assigned. It is far more stressful than doing the work at school. It is also difficult because there is lack in communication. I don’t always understand what I’m supposed to do for some assignments. I’ve also had problems with online conferences. I’ve had teachers that accidentally say the wrong time to meet, or not being able to reach some students.— Tiana, Utah
With the recent spread of the pandemic, I find that online school has impacted me the most. Not only I can’t see my friends from school, online school is also way more stressful that normal school. It can be hard to do school when there are so many distractions like YouTube and looking on social media. Or even not feeling motivated to do online school. But the worst part it just trying to find and do the assignments and getting good grades.— Morgan, Eugene OR
I realized that my habits have changed. I use my phone as soon as I wake up to check Google Classroom notifications, not Instagram. The whole situation is ironic because in school, I had the temptation to scroll through Instagram, yet when home, I find myself motivated to achieve the satisfaction of finishing assignments and clicking that submit button. The time I used to spend checking snapchat stories is now time I use to listen to podcasts on Spotify. I find myself naturally distancing from the one object I was addicted to three months ago.— Akshara Koottala, New Rochelle High School, NY
Trying something newBefore coronavirus, I had begun to start relying on my phone less often than usual. My screen time went from five to three hours, and I finally realized that I did not need my phone as much as I thought I did. However, once we were out of school and sports were cancelled, I was on my phone for up to eight or nine hours a day, which is crazy! …
On the bright side, I have started using Twitter more (for news and entertainment purposes), and I am striving to become stronger in financial literacy and the stock market, since it is such a crazy time right now on Wall Street. One of my father’s friends began day trading to pass the time, so it is interesting to hear from him about how his stocks and his money are standing, even with the market as bad as it is.— Carter Osborn, Hoggard High School in Wilmington, NC
The CoronaVirus has hardly affected my internet usage at all. My screen time has barely gone up at all. I used to average around 15-16 hours on my phone each day, and now I average just about 16 hours. However now I do diversify what I do on my electronics. To pass the time I have been using my electronics to do things like mastering a skill and trying new games— Nathanael Kassahun, J.R. Masterman, Philadelphia, PA
Building relationshipsI find that I get anxious when I spend more time of social media platforms. This being said, now that many of my relationships are based off of screen interaction, I have had to remind myself to spend more time on the phone with friends as opposed to messaging them. Calling someone or FaceTiming them leaves me happier and less anxious then when I type our conversations. I’ve started to call a person per day while social distancing … and it has really helped improve my mental health. I highly recommend!— Madeline Fox, Pennington NJ
My friends and I also try to talk and video chat more often, also allowing me to have a form of social interaction through the internet. I find myself video chatting with family members more consistently rather than talking to them on the phone every few weeks. This allows me to see them virtually, and even though they live thousands of miles away, this allows me to feel closer to them. 
While the coronavirus has provided a grand number of changes, the internet has allowed me to keep some consistency and routines in these tough times. Without the online access that we have, I cannot imagine how the world would be able to handle the pandemic since so much of our lives revolve around being connected online.— Nora Shefferman, New Rochelle High School, NY
MourningMy experience has been 50/50 because 2 of my family members died due to the virus and my brother and law had survived the virus and spent two weeks in the hospital. The graph does match my experience because my family is sad of our family members that died and they were important to our lives. There are many videos of nurses crying and how the death rates have grown in New York in the past 2 months and nurses quitting there job to support there families— Arturo Salas, Queens
_________Where Would You Like to Be Stranded?
A couple from South Africa found themselves stranded on their honeymoon in the Maldives after their country closed its borders to slow the spread of the coronavirus. 
Inspired by their story, we asked students were they would like to be during the pandemic in our Picture Prompt, “Stuck in Paradise.” From beaches to their homes to Target, here’s what they had to say:A tropical getawayIf I was stranded, I would want to be on a beach that has all of the supplies I need to survive. Such as fruits, wood, and things to build a fire. I would probably take one or two of my friends just to try the experiment. I would also bring snorkel stuff and maybe try to borrow a surfboard so I can have fun. I might also bring my dog. I don’t want to have to worry about COVID-19. I would want to get away so that I can get rid of all the anxiety and stress. I might also bring my dog.— Hen, Des Moines, Iowa
If I could be stuck somewhere in the world during this pandemic it would definitely be the Bahamas. The Bahamas is such a beautiful place to spend time and the water is so clear. I would be spending most of my time at the beach or a nice beach house. I would certainly miss my family but if I had the choice, they would be there with me. The Bahamas would definitely take my mind off of the horrible things happening recently with the virus. I could just stay there and relax without having to think about anything.— Kaitlyn Frances, New York
With loved onesMy sister was studying abroad in Paris this year. When Trump closed all travel from Europe, my family was freaking out. They weren’t sure if that meant my sister wouldn’t be able to fly home. That night, my mom waited on hold with Air France for 3 hours in order to get my sister on the soonest flight home to Chicago. Although I was excited that my sister was coming home, at first I was confused why everyone was freaking out so much. I personally would much rather be trapped in Paris, than in the snow here in Chicago. After careful consideration, I realized why it was so important for her to come home. The most essential thing right now is that families stick together. If my sister was still in Paris, my parents would never stop stressing out. 
So in the end, I would like to be quarantined with my loved ones. (If I really had a choice, I wouldn’t mind doing my e learning by the pool) But for now, I wouldn’t care where I was, as long as my family was all together.— Ellie Short, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL
I don’t know if stranded would be the right vernacular but if I could be quarantined in any place during this pandemic I would want to go to Korea. I am Korean by my parents and while my immediate family is here in Southern California, my entire extended family is in Korea. Having been to my home country multiple times in the past I know how amazing and different the life there is. But especially during my only-child life-at-home experience, I realized that I want nothing more than to be with my family and my people. — Brenda Kim, Valencia High School
If I were to be quarantined anywhere, I would probably choose Cuba. I have lots of family there who I never get to see, and staying with them for an extended period of time is a luxury for me and my family. Not only would I get to spend time with the people I love, I would get to enjoy the weather and explore the island with my cousins and brother.— Lucia T, Brooklyn, NY
I would want to be stuck in the band room of my school, that is where I have had the best memories, and would be around my favorite people, its truly my home away from home and would do anything to be there right now.— Abigail, Pennsylvania
Somewhere funIf I had to be quarantined anywhere it would definitely be a mountain house in the Lake Tahoe area. I would want to be quarantined here because while the main ski resorts are close you can never really close the backcountry. And while It would definitely be a challenge I think it would be a ton of fun.— Isaac, Brooklyn Ny
I would want to be stranded in Alabama where I could be playing with baby fainting goats, relaxing, being in the heat, eating barbecue, drinking sweet tea and working in the gardens. I would be riding a tractor and swimming.— Kate Schwartzman, NYC
I would honestly like to be stranded in Traverse City, Michigan during the summertime. The weather is absolutely amazing in that time of the year. I’d rather experience the fascination of the sunset in the Grand Traverse Bay rather than being stuck at home during this pandemic constantly getting bored. I’ve had a few days where I have rode my bike through my neighborhood, but it isn’t as enjoyable as walking through the downtown area of Traverse City and visiting the shops in the area. The breeze I tend to get in my area doesn’t feel as good as the breeze you get on Pangea’s Pizza’s rooftop seating while having a basket of cajun jerk french fries.— Gavin Meek, Detroit, MI
A strategic locationIf I could be stuck anywhere during this quarantine, it would be in Target. It is literally the smartest option and one of the best places on Earth. If your bored they have televisions, phones, and video games. If your hungry they have a food section and even a (Starbucks depending on your location). You also do not have to worry about weather or animals because it is indoors … It is also the perfect opportunity to do things almost everyone secretly wishes they could do in Target like create a mountain of pillows or ride the carts up and down the aisle.— Ashira, Cambria Heights
I would be stuck in my video game room. It‘s not necessarily paradise but it is my favorite pass time. I would never get bored because the vide games are with me. Honestly that sounds awesome to me.— Atticus, Earth
If I were stranded somewhere during this pandemic, I would like to be stranded on Pitcairn Island, South Pacific. I would want to be stuck there because the Island is very remote with only 50 people currently living there. The chances of me getting the virus is less likely in a more remote location rather that a place that is densely populated. Also, because it is not very populated, there will be more resources to go around like food and water. And because it is surrounded by water, there should be plenty of fish to eat and fish is a good source of vitamins and minerals. My last and final reason why I chose this place is because the views are amazing and I would probably spend my days swimming in the clear water and hiking in the forest.— Franklin, Philadelphia
I know this is weird, but I’d want to be stuck in Singapore Changi Airport. That place is huge, filled with entertainment, and looks absolutely stunning! I would just spend my days walking around and exploring that airport, I’ve heard they have entire malls, and even rooms for people to stay in. Being stuck in one place sucks, but at least I’m in an airport, when ever the pandemic ends, I’d be the one of the first to get on a flight and go home.— Khang T, Saint Louis
No place like homeDuring a pandemic, there’s no place I’d rather be than at home. A tropical island or some exotic place would seem nice at first, but then I’d start to feel lonely, and the fear of getting sick would outweigh any feelings of excitement for being on vacation. By being stuck at home, I’m with my family and near my friends. At home, the feeling of familiarity outweighs any fear of getting sick.— NK, King of Prussia
If I were to be stranded somewhere during a pandemic, I would want to be home. Yes, of course being on a tropical island with the sun shining down on you all day would be amazing. But during such a strange time, I’d want to be somewhere a safe and with people I trust. I would spend my time relaxing and learning new things, trying to find new hobbies. Being stuck somewhere not able to go home would be a challenge but that means you are in a whole new environment so I’d embrace it and see if there is something there I can do.— Brandon, Glenbard West HS Glen Ellyn, IL
If I was stuck somewhere I would want it to be my home because my home is were my family is and since I am just a kid, I can’t Survive anywhere else. Plus, I love my family, they give me food and shelter, they care for me. So if there is anywhere I would want to get stuck at. It would be my home.— Konrad Filbeck, Bethesda Maryland"
65,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/us/coronavirus-24-hours-america.html,The New York Times,2020-04-04,['Joana Avillez'],24 Hours in a Pandemic Nation,,"
The merciless threat slipped into America, emptying its streets, shuttering its stores, wrecking its economy and forcing its people to retreat indoors.
In this new country, once crowded cities now feel abandoned, as if everyone suddenly moved out. There is no rush hour on the nation’s highways. “Closed” signs hang from the front doors of business after business.
For many, this coronavirus pandemic involves the most dramatic kind of fight — for life, for food, for money. For others, it can feel absurdly trifling as they stay inside — a fight against boredom, binge eating, isolation.
There was Kalee Kamer, in Portsmouth, Ohio, 27 months sober and motivated to stay that way, participating in a recovery meeting that has moved online. Chris Allison, patrolling the quiet city of Norman, Okla., in a sanitized police vehicle and with a blue face mask. And the Rev. Rob Lee, a pastor in Newton, N.C., without a congregation, summoning hope amid the gloom.
This was America over 24 hours this past week, on pause and full-tilt, as the sun rose and then set and then rose again on a profoundly altered nation.
6:30 a.m.MiamiA trip to a ventanita, in Miami culture, is not just about the $1.82 cup of sweet and foamy cafecito. It is about conversation and gossip, a hangout for nosy retirees and chatty working stiffs. Queuing is taboo. Wriggling and squeezing are the ways to reach the counter.
Or at least they were.
Flouting social distancing rules, crowds continued to congregate outside ventanitas, so much so that the county mayor threatened to shut them down. Sergio’s, where the espresso machine continues to whirl and buzz, rushed to tape markers — six feet apart — on the ground.
Now customers approach with caution, peering through new panes of plexiglass to order. Many scurry off with their provisions tucked in a brown paper bag.
“This is my only outing,” said Daisy Abreu, 58, who works in magazines and left with one café con leche, one guava pastry and two empanadas.
But first she lingered for a moment to check in with Reinaldo Mesa, a 61-year-old airport contractor who picked up coffee and a medianoche sandwich. He, too, had given up most everything in his daily routine. Except the ventanita.— Patricia Mazzei
8 a.m.Erie, Colo.Sherry Maloney rolled out of bed, strapped on a face mask and headed for the Safeway. Today was toilet paper day. Maybe.
Rumor had it that a shipment of paper products had come in the night before. By 6:30 a.m., she was standing outside, shivering with her husband, fingers crossed she would snag a package.
One man was down to three rolls at home. A woman said she was about ready to cut squares out of cloth diapers. “I’ve been rationing two squares a trip,” said Ms. Maloney, 63.
In the grand scheme of things, a toilet paper shortage at home is certainly not the worst crisis. But it is also certainly not normal in a land of plenty.
Inside the locked store, clerks wiped down shopping carts and spritzed the self-checkout stations. Outside, everyone talked about how a trip to the store had devolved into a Hobbesian supermarket sweep. Jostling lines. Frantic customers. Stressed employees, exposed to God knows what germs for God knows how many hours every day.
“It’s starting to get ugly,” Ms. Maloney said. But it was friendly in line this morning. Two buddies ran into each other — “Don’t shake his hand!” one shouted.
The doors slid open, and Ms. Maloney strode inside.— Jack Healy
10 a.m.AtlantaTonnia Blount shifted her big yellow school bus into gear and started off on the route she had been running for a decade, only now with no children to pick up and none to drop off. They were all at home, stuck in little bungalows and apartments scattered across the working-class neighborhoods of southeast Atlanta.
But with nearly four in five Atlanta public school students poor enough to qualify for free or reduced lunch, most still needed their cafeteria calories. So this was Ms. Blount’s work for the foreseeable future: pulling her empty bus in front of Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, loading it up with brown sacks full of breakfast and lunch, and then delivering the sacks out in the maze of narrow streets, more like the driver of an ice-cream truck.
“I know my children,” she said. “I know who is in need.”
Every few blocks, Ms. Blount, 55, stopped the bus and honked until the parents and grandparents and aunties came out. “How many babies?” a co-worker in the back of the bus would ask them, smiling, handing the bags down.
Sometimes they were not babies at all. Bryan Bush, 19, came out of an apartment in sweats and a hoodie. He had been working at Six Flags Over Georgia, the amusement park.
Not anymore, he said. He grabbed a sack of breakfast and a sack of lunch.— Richard Fausset
11:40 a.m.BostonThalia Bardell crouched in front of the laptop she had propped up on a chair, centering it in the roughly three-foot-wide wedge of space between the end of her unmade bed and a dresser.
“Hi, B!” she called out to the screen. “How’s the dogs?”“They’re trouble,” the screen replied.Ms. Bardell teaches barre exercises, which are modeled loosely after ballet, to mostly women in their 20s, 30s and 40s. When Boston shut down, her clients begged her to come up with a way to give their minds and bodies a break from idle worry about the pandemic.
Live-streamed exercise instruction was having a moment before the crisis, as home fitness companies like Peloton paired their machines with remote-access instructors. Now teaching remotely is one of the few options instructors have left.
She called the group to attention. “All right guys, let’s go!” Nurses, bartenders, teachers and financial analysts appeared on the screen, following her through a routine of squats and lunges as she snapped her fingers with the precision of a metronome.
“Kerry, that’s a beautiful pace!” she said.“Maite, lower your hips an inch.”Ms. Bardell believes in moving quickly so no one has time to dwell on the pain. “You’re in a physically uncomfortable situation right now in your body, and you’re in an emotionally uncomfortable situation in the world,” she said. “And it’s like, we’re going to get through this together, just like we do with every single class.”— Caitlin Dickerson

12:30 p.m.Amherst, Mass.Ariana Lee, a Chinese student stranded on the campus of Amherst College, walked into a dining hall past a pandemic-era warning sign: “Admittance Restricted.”
The food service workers lit up when they saw her. She greeted them brightly. “Hi! Can I get the pulled chicken taco over Mexican rice? And some guac with the salsa, please?”
These days, with classes now online, campus feels like a ghost town. In her one-minute walk to the dining hall, Ms. Lee, a senior, encountered only one other person, a janitor pushing a cart full of cleaning supplies across the common room, like a lone ship leaning into a storm.
The servers wore gloves, but no masks. The open cereal dispensers stood empty. The cafeteria tables were cordoned off.
The food was tastier than it was before the pandemic, she said, but the portions were smaller. She preferred not to pick up food in town, though, because “people on the street say racist things.” The other day, a man called her Chinese-American friend a racial expletive and said that wearing a mask would not help.
Her parents have left Beijing and are riding out a two-week quarantine in a small apartment in Hong Kong. They have to wear trackers on their wrists. Food is delivered to their door. Her mother sprays down every package with disinfectant.
Ms. Lee walked back to her dorm room, unpacked her brown paper bag and laid out her food on her desk: two bananas, an orange, a cardboard bowl of rice, a cardboard box of chicken tacos. She looked at it, as if it were a still-life painting, and did not eat.— Anemona Hartocollis
2:04 pmPittsburghThe milk incident happened right after lunch, when the 8-year-old was losing patience with long division. It was his second tantrum of the day, the first set off by a missing sweatshirt. That one had been pretty loud, but at least it didn’t involve spilling milk all over the dining room table.
A home-schooling mother as of two weeks ago, Tanying Dong, 39, has been trying to make sure her oldest son does at least some schoolwork every day. When he is absorbed in a lesson and his little brothers, ages 2 and 5, are nestled in the soft glow of PBS Kids, Ms. Dong can then maybe get to some of the endless other tasks. Such as her paying job, in public law. And the housework. The meals. The checking-in on friends and relatives.
Three boys, at prime havoc age, with no school, no day care, no babysitter, no playgrounds, no friends and, for much of the time, no other adult.
Amid it all, she has taken up sewing. Specifically, face masks for the whole family. Ms. Dong’s husband is a pediatric anesthesiologist, and while the children’s hospital is not yet a battlefield infirmary like so many urban emergency rooms, things could change quickly.
The sewing had been going pretty well until the 5-year-old knocked the sewing machine on the floor. Her husband seems to have fixed it. She’ll know tonight when she picks it back up, once the kids are in bed.— Campbell Robertson
2:49 p.m.Norman, Okla.Police Officer Chris Allison pulled over a red Chrysler 300 sedan, approached from the passenger side and asked the driver for his license and insurance. The man pulled the papers from his glove compartment and leaned toward the window. But Officer Allison didn’t touch them.
He reached instead for his cellphone.“OK, I’m just going to take a picture of that,” Officer Allison told the man.
Officer Allison, 34, patrols southwest Norman, where a stay-at-home order is in effect and four nursing home residents have died from the pandemic. Norman is different now, and so is policing. The most prosaic parts of the job have become potential hazmat situations.
Officers used to sit two to a table for pre-shift briefings at headquarters, but social distancing put an end to roll call. Officers also keep their distance from one another when they go out on calls. On Tuesday, the officer’s lunch got a wipe-down: He used Clorox wipes to disinfect his milkshake, tea and wrapped straws.
At the end of his shift, he used to park his police S.U.V. outside his house, walk inside and hug his wife, 5-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son. Now, he pulls straight into the garage, undresses there, stuffs his uniform into the washing machine, disinfects his equipment and then heads straight for the shower before touching anyone.
It turned out that the Chrysler’s license plate didn’t match the vehicle. Maybe it was stolen. Maybe the driver hadn’t registered it yet. From the driver’s seat of the S.U.V., the officer asked for backup. Then he readied himself to face the driver again. He reached over to the passenger seat for his blue cloth mask.— Manny Fernandez
4:16 p.m.Orlando, Fla.Kimberley Mitchell, a second-generation funeral director, gathered the grieving family in her office. In the age of social distancing, her only goal was to help them hang on to the tiniest bit of cultural tradition.
Ms. Mitchell of Mitchell’s Funeral Home looked into the eyes of the family representative seated across the room. A month ago, she would have placed her hand on the relative’s shoulder as a gesture of comfort.
On this afternoon, she gently laid out the dizzying, surreal set of safety rules reshaping how America buries its dead. The family settled on a simple half-hour service in the chapel. It has 22 rows of pews — room for seven mourners, a pastor and two staff members. They also decided to hold a memorial service once the country returned to normal.
“It feels something like ‘to be continued’ for some people saying goodbye to their loved ones,” she said.
Before the crisis, Ms. Mitchell greeted family members reeling from loss with hugs. Now, it was simply too risky. Now mourners had to move through reposing rooms in shifts, one small group at a time.
It was jarring. And exhausting. And unmooring.But Ms. Mitchell still had her smile and her words. She could still offer hope and the promise of healing by reciting from the 30th chapter of Psalms — “joy cometh in the morning.”
“The hardest thing is to see someone grieving alone,” she said. “Think about that. Alone.”— Audra D.S. Burch
5:01 p.m.Pascagoula, Miss.Dr. Steven Demetropoulos had been seeing patients since 7:10 a.m. He was tired, but he was also a man on a mission.
He needed to drive home in his pickup truck so he could quickly change clothes before heading back out, straight to City Hall, where he hoped to convince the Council to enact a curfew.
In February, Dr. Demetropoulos became the mayor of Pascagoula, a Gulf Coast city of about 21,000 people. He ran on a platform of economic growth and beautification.
But now he also makes videos for residents about how to survive the worst public health crisis in decades. “This is Dr. Steve, your mayor,” he tells them, dressed in green scrubs behind the mayor’s desk.
Tomorrow he would make another video, about how droplets spread through the air and why it was important that people stay six feet apart.
His advice is not limited to physical health.“Keep trusting, keep praying,” he said in one video. “We will get through this together.”— Rick Rojas

7 p.m.Portsmouth, OhioKalee Kamer was in bed, snuggled next to her boyfriend and their cat, Dirtball, participating in a drug recovery meeting streaming on Facebook Live.
Ms. Kamer — 27 months sober after decades of addiction to heroin, meth, crack and whatever else she could get her hands on — lost her burger-joint waitressing job on March 15. She and her boyfriend, Chris Keeton, who is also in recovery, have cleaned the house so thoroughly it practically gleams. They watch four or five virtual recovery meetings a week.
In this small city, the center of Ohio’s opioid epidemic, temptation is never far.The couple’s gazes are fixed on the Facebook session, hosted by a local drug recovery group called Raw Addiction.
Kathy Newman, a drug treatment counselor nearly nine years in recovery, urged viewers like Ms. Kamer to stick with the program. Flurries of emojis rose across the screen as viewers cheered in support.
Hundreds of comments appeared in real time — testaments of hope and despair that would, in normal times, be shared face-to-face.
I’m afraid of picking up the needle again … I need out.I’m in rehab.April 6th will be 18 months clean from shooting up. You guys are such a great inspiration.
Ms. Kamer, 32, wrote one: Did 2 years in prison. Haven’t seen my son in 3.5 years, been clean 27 months. He is a huge motivation on why I’m still clean! #goals
It was one voice in an ocean.I got 31 days.First time watcher.I am so close to breaking.— Dan Levin
9 p.m.Los AngelesThe schedule promised a matchup between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies. But Dodger Stadium is empty, its doors locked shut, and outside, the birds are louder than what is left of traffic in one of America’s most congested cities.
All the familiar faces are somewhere else. The guys hawking T-shirts, the guys selling beers out of coolers, the guys scalping tickets, the women cooking bacon-wrapped hot dogs just before the final uphill into the stadium parking lots, blocked off with signs that now say “No public access.”
Solitary joggers passed by, one after another, under billboards advertising season tickets for a season in limbo. A man in a surgical mask walked his pug.
Alex Wood, the 29-year-old left-hander, was scheduled to pitch for the Dodgers. Right about now, the Rockies would be finishing batting practice, and Mr. Wood would be in the clubhouse going over the game plan with his catcher and pitching coach. Instead, he’s a few hundred miles away in Arizona, crashing at a teammate’s house. He said he was throwing most days, and just trying to maintain “some semblance of sanity.”
During what would have been game time, he said, he was doing pretty much what every other American was doing. Eating. Watching television. Sleeping.
Mr. Wood counseled patience for frustrated fans. “Let that excitement continue to build,” he said, “and let it loose once we start our season.”— Tim Arango
11 p.m.North Kansas City, Mo.Donna Danahy was sitting on a mattress in a hotel just off the interstate, queasy from the rising waves of dread and uncertainty.
Ms. Danahy, 58, lost her job as a server at Steak ’n Shake a couple of weeks back when it moved to drive-through only. With that, she lost the income needed to pay the first month’s rent — $600 — on what was supposed to be a new studio apartment.
A co-worker she had been staying with left town, leaving Ms. Danahy homeless. For several days she parked her 2006 Toyota Camry in a truck stop, drawing down curtains attached with Velcro, sliding a sun visor in the windshield and tucking her 5-foot-1-inch frame into the back seat for a nerve-racking attempt at sleep. Sometimes she closed her eyes and wished she would never wake up. Sometimes she was hard on herself for not securing a more stable existence.
“Leading up to this, I felt all this was self-induced; I did this to myself,” she said.The plan had been to move into the new place on April 1. But the landlord told Ms. Danahy she would release her unit if she could not come up with the money by April 14. She was hired for a $13-an-hour job at a grocery store deli but could not start until she got her birth certificate, which was on its way in the mail.
A social services organization secured her the hotel room for a week. But what would she do once the week was up? She began to cry. It was hard not to feel vulnerable. She has asthma. She wondered if she would get infected from all the moving around.— John Eligon
12:40 a.m.Kirkland, Wash.Tammy Wiatrowski curled up on a lilac sectional with a writing tray and a floral-patterned journal.She has been writing in it since early March, after working 57 hours over four days as a charge nurse in a critical care unit. It had dealt with the first spate of the nation’s deaths, a crunch of supplies, quarantined employees and a dire uncertainty.“As the weekend went on and more patients lost their battle with the virus, I realized both my daughters and all 5 of my grandkids could get this and might not survive.”She told her daughters that weekend that it might be months before they could spend time together. Her home has been quiet ever since. No slumber parties. The Nerf guns sit unused. The video game console is off. Ms. Wiatrowski has instead gone shopping, leaving groceries at her daughter’s doorstep and stepping back.“Only to be able to wave as she opened the door. Telling them ‘I love them!’ My grandson saying, ‘It’s OK, Granny, I can give you an invisible hug!’ as he stretched his arms out …”For the first time in 14 years, her job has distanced her from the ones she loves. It is the same for her patients.
Ms. Wiatrowski cannot bring families in to hold hands during the last breaths. She cannot wrap her arms around those who are in grief. She cannot help them get a talisman, like a lock of hair or an EKG strip.“I can’t even give them a piece of paper with their heartbeat without feeling like it’s contaminated. Now everything feels contaminated.”— Mike Baker
1 a.m.Berkeley, Calif.In the manner of academic scientists during normal times, at the end of a day that was light years from normal, Enrique Lin Shiao led with the data.
Never mind that the prestigious University of California, Berkeley, biology laboratory where he is a postdoctoral fellow was shuttered for regular research studies. Or that Dr. Lin Shiao, 31, was presenting his results to disembodied colleagues in a Slack channel as he ate dinner.
What mattered was that providing the data to the Food and Drug Administration was a prerequisite for clearance to perform much-needed clinical tests for the new coronavirus.
And the data was good.“Awesome work,” typed Jennifer Doudna, a Berkeley professor who runs the Innovative Genomics Institute, as she studied Dr. Lin Shiao’s graphs from her living room.
The dearth of tests available to Americans who may be infected has anguished molecular biologists, whose research routinely invokes the basic procedure used to detect virus genes in a patient’s nasal swab.
Dr. Doudna, the co-developer of a gene-editing tool called CRISPR, has transformed the first floor of her institute into a testing center that aims to process at least 1,000 samples a day. But first, the group needed to show the F.D.A. the lowest level of virus its test could detect.
As some of Dr. Lin Shiao’s colleagues appended congratulatory “clapping” and “on fire” icons to the charts that indicated the test was highly sensitive, others looked ahead, to when they would begin again.— Amy Harmon
5 a.m.New YorkThe sky over Central Park was slate gray, with pinpoints of stars dim amid the city’s stubborn glow.
The East Meadow, its lush grass preserved by fences and “Keep Off” signs for an anticipated summer of sun tanning and picnics, was instead bathed in a sea of white medical tents brought by truck from North Carolina to aid the city’s overwhelmed hospitals.
The tents — 14 in all — were empty, save for 68 portable metal beds, neatly laid with identical white sheets and pillows.
Samaritan’s Purse, a Christian charity, drove in its own supplies. Once the field hospital gets final administrative approval from health department officials to operate, the city will supply the patients.
In the I.C.U. tent, there were 10 beds, each accompanied by the most desired piece of medical equipment in the world — a ventilator, which can cost upward of $50,000.
Samaritan’s Purse has used the same field hospital to treat families stricken by Ebola in Liberia, to care for townspeople who had been trapped in rubble after an earthquake in Ecuador, and to operate on children in Iraq who had been struck by shrapnel launched by the Islamic State.
A few weeks ago, it set up a similar field hospital in Cremona, Italy, the nation with the world’s most coronavirus fatalities. This is the first time one of the hospitals has been deployed in the United States. No one knows how long a field hospital will be needed in the center of Manhattan.— Timothy Williams
6 a.m.Newton, N.C.The sky was still dark when the Rev. Rob Lee sat down at his desk, picked up his fountain pen and began to write.
Even in normal times, Mr. Lee, 27, is an early riser. But in the weeks since a pandemic put an end to all routines, including Sunday church, he has been waking up earlier and earlier, no need for an alarm.
He thinks about his congregation of about 50 regulars and the “collective pain” shared across the world right now. He thinks about his wife, who lost hours at her marketing job. He thinks about his mother, a hospice nurse. And, if he is being honest, he thinks about himself, his own mortality. A year and a half ago, a lung collapsed during an asthma attack, leaving him especially vulnerable to the outbreak.
A few weeks ago, as the crisis intensified, he issued an online callout for prayer requests and offered to send handwritten letters in return. So far, he has received more than 300:I am alone in California and far from family.I just lost my job today.I feel lonely and unsettled in these times.
Mr. Lee, a descendant of General Robert E. Lee who once made headlines for speaking out against white supremacy and Confederate monuments, sees the current crisis as another pivotal moment for the country.
Writing back to the supplicants has become both a grounding ritual to calm his own anxieties — and a small act of resistance.
“It’s a sense of, we’re going to show up,” he said. “The coronavirus is terrible, but it’s not the fullness of who we are as a people. It’s not the end of our story.”— Sarah Mervosh"

Please note: This post is part of The Learning Network’s ongoing Current Events Conversation feature. We invite students to react to the news via our daily writing prompts and, each week, we publish a selection of their comments.

In “Coronavirus Is Shutting Schools. Is America Ready for Virtual Learning?” Dana Goldstein writes about the great shift that began taking place in American education last month. For this week’s roundup of student comments on our writing prompts, we asked students how they have been coping with remote learning.
They told us about all the things they miss about going to school: their friends, teachers, sports, extracurricular activities, even “the loud and crazy lunchroom.” 
But some students have discovered that they enjoy getting to work at their own pace, set their own schedule and be free from “the stressful environment of school.” 
Others, though, recounted the challenges of distance learning, from struggling to understand assignments and getting easily distracted to not having reliable internet. “If you had told me a few months ago that I would be praying to go to school, I would’ve laughed and called you crazy, but I would do anything to go back to my school,” Hannah from Nashville said.
Before we get to the rest of the comments, we’d like to give a warm welcome to the new students who joined the conversation this week from: Barcelona; Berkeley, Calif.; Brighton, Mich.; Buckeye, Ariz.; Dawson High School; Easton, Conn.; Englewood, Colo.; Forest Lake Christian School, Auburn, Calif.; Fruitland, Idaho; Fulton Science Academy, Alpharetta, Ga.; Hawkins, Ind.; Irving, Tex.; Lacey, Wash.; Lawrenceville, N.J.; London; Long Beach, Wash.; Malverne, N.Y.; Martin Luther School-Maspeth, Queens, N.Y.; Mexico; New Orleans, La.; Rochester, N.Y.; Roland Grise Middle School; Sunnyvale, Calif.; WLSA Shanghai Academy and Yakima, Wash.

‘I did not realize that I took my routine and school day for granted until now.’School is a place for building friendships, learning responsibility, and getting an escape from the house, but it seems as though the Coronavirus has taken that all away from us. For me, I loved getting to see my friends everyday in the school environment. Now that it’s taken away from me, I realize now that school was my main source of communicating with people. Now I feel as though I’m losing friendships I had at school since we can’t go anymore. School also taught us responsibility. I had a schedule when going to classes and when to wake up and go to bed. Now that I have no reason to have a schedule, I have been going to bed and waking up much later than I used to. There also seems to be a lack of motivation for me now to accomplish tasks because at school, we were given an hour and a half each day to get work done in class but now I keep pushing assignments back until the last second. This definitely won’t be beneficial to my work ethic in the upcoming senior year for me … Thanks to the Coronavirus, I have decided to make every moment of my senior year count and not take it for granted as I did for the past three years of high school.— Owen Midgette, Norfolk, VA
I did not realize that I took my routine and school day for granted until now. My online school day consists of waking up at 10 am instead of 6 am, working on my laptop in my bed instead of a classroom, and now I make my own schedule. While this sounds pretty enjoyable for any teenager, it has made me miss school. I miss walking down the hallways with my friends. I miss sitting in a classroom with a teacher and other students, having discussions and asking questions. I miss the loud and crazy lunchroom. I truly miss things I didn’t even know that I loved about my school. If you had told me a few months ago that I would be praying to go to school, I would’ve laughed and called you crazy, but I would do anything to go back to my school.— Hannah, Nashville
Something I find really special about my high school is that we are really focused on student-centered learning. We use a Harkness-style teaching method where all the students and the teacher sit at a round table together and instead of learning through lecturing, we learn from each other. Peer-to-peer interaction is a really pivotal part of education at my school, and it feels like it falls so short in our distance learning. We use Zoom and can see one another and our teacher, but everyone is always muted so as not to interfere with background noise. Our classes have been cut down by ten minutes and instead of having six classes a day, we only have three or four classes synchronously. I feel like my education is not being fulfilled. I have a significant lack of motivation and I miss the thought-provoking discussions I used to have with my classmates during physical school. I am really anxious to get back to school and really foster my love of learning through my peers.— Emily Barkley, Lawrenceville, NJ
‘The workload has been overwhelming.’“Oh my goodness … Why there is so much homework?” This was my first reaction to online study as I looked at the homework checklist. Due to the outbreak, most activities, including daily clubs, are canceled at present, thus we do not have much to do at home. At least teachers believe so; therefore, tons of homework overwhelms us everyday. However, we actually get much to do everyday besides homework: standardized tests, such as TOEFL, SAT, AP, etc., needed to be prepared; activities that could be done indoor had to be completed … Homework is the straw which breaks the camel’s back. How I hope that assignment could be a little less and more time could be controllable by ourselves! I am now in China. Online study has already taken place for 2 months so far. Sometimes I really wish to go back to school having lessons face to face with teachers and classmates. School is not only a place for study, but a place to prepare us for future life when we embark upon complicated society and interpersonal relationship. Online education cannot replace school system thoroughly in this aspect. I really miss normal school days. Is the day of returning far?— Sophie Dai, WLSA Shanghai Academy
The workload … has been overwhelming. The thought process of my teachers seems to be “Oh they have all of this free time now, so I can assign them more work than I normally would.”  Or at least something along the lines of that, because my teachers haven’t let up one bit. That’s been the most challenging part of remote learning, because I get easily distracted when I try to work in my house, and that I have even more work than normal, it’s challenging to get everything done. I have been able to keep up with what we’ve been learning for the most part, but it would be nice to have a teacher that could answer my questions and help me in person.— William, The Barker
I’m in my second week of online distance learning and it’s exhausting! Yes, school now starts at 9 am and we end at around 2:30, so it’s not like I’m doing school work all day. However, now I’m on the computer for about 4 or 5 hours at a time. Before the whole pandemic happened, I only spent about an hour, maybe 2 on the computer both at school and at home. At the end of the day, I don’t want to see another computer for a while. I actually did some research (on the computer) and I found that I was suffering from computer fatigue. Yep, it’s a real thing.— Miriam, Oakland, CA
I also find it very hard to find an ‘escape’ from school. Since it all takes place at my home, destressing has become more difficult because I feel like school is there with me the entire day. I really hope, in the near future, we will be returning to our school since I am not receiving the best education at home.— Zoe V., Nashville, TN
‘I find it impossible to actually learn anything new through the distance learning.’From what I have been through for the past two weeks is that online schooling is really a double edge knife. For example, it’s quite nice working at your own pace so you’re able to be less stressed with deadlines. But at the same time because of that, I have had a great deal of trouble keeping up with all of the work that my teachers have been putting onto me. That’s mostly because my pace is slower than most of my other classmates because my dyslexia and ADHD make it a lot harder to keep things on track because of how free things are. My teachers have been very understanding about it but there is only some much that they can do and I’m honestly quite scared for my end of the year grades. I have done fine this year grade-wise A’s and B’s but since this started they have been going down a bit and I’m not sure what to do because I’m doing what I can but it’s not doing anything to help my grades go up. So I’m just praying for the best at this point.— Stephan T, Easton CT
I enjoy the new schedule that internet school has given me, since I finally have time to sleep as much as I need and feel well rested and ready to work. Though my new schedule is beneficial, I find it impossible to actually learn anything new through the distance learning. It’s easier for me to get distracted and be lazy with my work, so I’m starting to hate the daily mundanity of distance learning. I never thought I’d want to be back in school until now.— Cali, King of Prussia, PA
Digital learning hasn’t been the best experience for me. I’m constantly caught in this game of tug of war of too much work and too little. Sometimes I’ll have three projects and four assignments due in one day and other days, I’ll have nothing. The lack of social interaction I, as well as my classmates, are enduring is also a huge factor in me not enjoying online schooling. Only one of my classes has actual online meetings where we can talk, while the others just keep posting work. I can’t learn like that though, so I haven’t really retained any of the information I just spit back at them for a grade.— Emma B., Cass High School, Georgia
‘I’m often anxious that I will not be able to join and maintain access to online classes and assignments.’Online school has been a stressful process for many of my friends and me. I live in an area where internet access and WiFi are hard to get and, as a result, I’m not only stressed about school but I’m often anxious that I will not be able to join and maintain access to online classes and assignments. Working at home is hard for me as well since there is no distinct separation of school v.s home. Normally at school, I am able to focus as it is a work environment and I am constantly communicating face-to-face with those around me. At home, I want to get up and go outside and stop staring at my iPad, it gives me headaches and I am tired of looking at it after 4-5 hours a day. Many of my teachers have been seemingly understanding of the issues caused by online school, but at the same time, they are continuing to give the normal work-load.— Kitty, Stockton, NJ
So far, no, our schools have not yet switched to online. However, they have given us a long list of websites and activity suggestions to keep students occupied in learning while the School District figures out what to do for us … My sister and I just recently came up with our own schedules (which consists of some of the suggested websites and activities of our own) which was fun! I started my school schedule today, since I just got off of Spring Break. My biggest concern, if they do switch to online (which will most likely occur soon) is the lack of technology my family has (like Dana Goldstein writes about in the first paragraph of the article). The School District just sent out a survey to see who is lacking the school supplies necessary to be involved in online school, so hopefully they will be able to rent out computers to families who need them, like mine. We only have one laptop, and sharing one with a timed schedule would be impossible! I’m keeping my fingers crossed! :)— Leah, Springfield, OR
‘I miss seeing everyone, especially my friends.’Out of the concerns that Ms. Goldstein expresses, the most relevant one is how schools provide so much more than academics. Social interaction, a way to exercise … I miss seeing everyone, especially my friends, even that teacher who talks too much … I mean, at least they’re there to explain the assignment. Zoom calls and texting and Google Hangouts just can’t replace face-to-face interaction. I’m a dancer too, and dance has always been so infallible to me, I felt like even if schools shut down it would somehow still be there. But it wasn’t. Sometimes I just feel really lost because I feel like I don’t have anything to hold onto. I’m just trying to do well in “class” and waiting for this to end.— Julia A, California
I too believe that school is more than just academics alone. School is what makes the basis of our early lives, 14 years of work, stress, and success. Not to mention all the great people you meet along the way, such as our mentors and teachers, as well as our lifelong friends. The activities I miss the most in school are going to my locker early in the morning, having quick chats with friends and colleagues, and roaming the halls listening to music. After school activities are another story, I miss going to track practice, making jokes with friends on a local loop (1.5 mile run around campus), and getting a good workout in for the day (thanks Mr. Frazer).— Ethan Davila, New York
‘I am actually quite fond of it.’Last week was the second week of E-Learning for my school, and I am actually quite fond of it. While I do understand the social aspect of school — as someone with an Anxiety Disorder lack of sleep and work load gets to me quickly, making this honestly an enjoyable experience for me. I feel as though I can learn the material at my own pace and on my own time, with breaks when I need them. With the stressful environment of school being significantly reduced, in my mind the pros of E-Learning outweigh the cons. I enjoy getting to know my teachers and classmates but I think there is a lot to be learned from the teaching and learning style we’ve had to embrace.— Ella Mastin, Glenbard West HS
With the new shift to online schooling, I feel like an adult working from home. I get to organize my work schedule so that it works best for me, and I get to complete all of my work from the comfort of my own room. In the mornings I put on a nice shirt, so I look put together when attending online instructional Zoom or Microsoft Teams meetings, but what the camera, my teachers, and my peers cannot see is that I am actually lounging around in the comfort of my sweatpants.— Tracey N, Dawson HS
Before a normal school day involved me waking up at 5:45 and returning home at 3:30. Now, I wake up at whatever time I’d like, which has had a positive effect on me, reducing my levels of stress overall. I find that I am able to stay on task effectively, as I am able to work at my own pace and at the time I choose to. I find myself adequately occupied with work, as I have spent an average of 3 hours a day on schoolwork, which I feel is the same amount of work I completed in school, with the rest of the hours wasted on irrelevant information. I miss the social aspect most of school, as a social life is impossible to maintain virtually … In addition, the freed time has allowed me to pursue interests not supported by the public school system, as I have had more time to learn to code, and even accomplished creating a Virtual Private Network from scratch.— David Vallejo, Miami
Since I can plan out my day myself, I feel it suits me better than what school puts students through, though it is challenging to learn new topics of some subjects without direct explanation from a teacher.— Alicja Paruch, NY
‘A lot of the time, I get confused.’I am starting my third week of remote learning and let me tell you, I can not wait for the day this whole thing is over. My school went directly into remote learning around the time the first confirmed case was found in my state and I do not like it. I find myself getting distracted much easier and find myself procrastinating more and more. I’m not motivated to complete some work until I realize it will impact my grade, unlike normal school. A lot of the time, I get confused. I don’t have the luxury of being able to ask my teacher why I need to do different when I don’t understand something or don’t know what to do and a lot of the time, an email doesn’t get back to me in the time I am completing my work.— Tommy J, Saco
My first weeks of online classes have been hard because it’s difficult to stay on task with all the work we are being assigned by teachers. The work isn’t necessarily hard but figuring out how to use the different websites and when a new assignment has been posted takes a while. I am getting better at this as I go just like my classmates but sometimes I’ll miss some assignments I didn’t realize were due.— Gerlanda Di Stefano, Malverne NY
As someone who’s family is financially stable and has access to a computer, I can say that it hasn’t been extremely hard for me to get my work done. It was hard whenever I didn’t understand something and instead of being able to ask my teachers and get an immediate response, I had to email them and wait for them to email me back. I believe that I have it very lucky and I know that some of my peers are struggling a lot. 
I know that my school is trying very hard to help the kids, like providing food for children that relied on school lunches and having a curbside pickup for laptop rentals. They also have paper packets that they mailed so if you didn’t have access to the internet you could still continue learning and not get too far behind, which helps eliminate Dana Goldstein’s concern in that area, but there are still valid points that Goldstein makes that are still problems at my school as well.— Morgan Sharp, Anna, Texas
Here in England we were all told that schools would almost certainly not shut and if they did it wouldn’t be until after Easter. However, our PM closed schools until September and cancelled all exams all of a sudden, even though he said a few hours before he wouldn’t even close them for two weeks so none of our teachers were prepared. Frustratingly, my school isn’t using Zoom or Google Classroom (and neither are any others that I’ve heard of) but are instead putting work on to the shared area online which we have to manually search through hundreds of files everyday to find that work that has been set for our classes. Only one subject, English has actually given us instructions and tasks to complete with a weekly deadline — the others have just uploaded random files and past papers etc and not told us what to do or when its due … I find it really hard to be motivated to do work / study for exams I am not even going to be taking. I wish my school would make all subjects give us specific tasks with deadlines and maybe use online resources such as Google Classroom so that we have more structure.— Rachel, London, England
‘I’m missing out on my “high school experience.”’The worst part of this experience is the fact that I finally made it to high school and now I’m missing out on my “high school experience.” Everyone talks about how high school is some of the greatest years of our life, but right now it’s not off to a spectacular start. I’m only a freshman, but the poor seniors are getting hit the hardest. Not being in school means there’s no sports, no school dances like Prom, and there might not even be a graduation at this point. Imagine getting to senior year and thinking that it’s going to be the best year overall, and then getting told that you won’t get to finish your final season of the sport you’ve played your whole life, or you can’t go to your last dance with the people you’ve been with all of high school. These people might not get to even experience graduation. All of their hard work for the past four years might get handed to them in the form of a PDF or a document in the mailbox.— Natalie, Yakima, WA
I have been training for weeks to make state competition for poetry interpretation in Speech and Debate, and to see all my hard work go down the drain is disheartening. I felt like that opportunity was robbed from me. Since I am a junior, I now have to wait until senior year to attempt to attend state and it would be my last chance to do it. I really wish I was able to give it a shot this year.— Jessica Franklin, Dawson High School, TX
Personally the main thing I miss is my sports season, I was looking forward to this years lacrosse season the whole year and it was heart breaking to be on day 4 and have it be cancelled.— James, Barkoukis
One of the things I’m missing about school is theater. Before school was closed, I had two shows that were going to be performed the next week and now I don’t even know if I’ll ever be able to perform the shows. Overall, this remote learning is an F in my book.— Kayla C., Cass High School, Georgia
‘I’ve had to become my seven-year-old brother’s teacher.’Everyday my motivation to do my work decreases and recently all my assignments have been turned in late causing my grades to drop. It has also been very difficult because I’ve had to become my seven-year-old brother’s teacher. My parents aren’t very fluent in English, so they aren’t able to help him with his schoolwork. It’s very challenging to keep up with both his work and my work at the same time.— Adriana Segura, Cass High School, GA
The switch to distance learning has been hard for my family. I’m lucky enough to go to a school that provides each student with a computer, but for the first two weeks my younger brother (age 9) didn’t. He was sent home with a folder packed with work, but once that ran out, his teacher expected him to go digital. We have a computer, but it’s barely functioning, let alone good enough to run the programs they expected us to use. This was later remedied, but he’s also on an IEP which means he’s used to one on one learning for math, science, and reading as well as holds a general animosity towards learning in general. We’re terrified for what this will do to the progress he’s made. My mom has been struggling to teach it to him so she’s been enlisting my help. I’m happy to do it, but now I’m tackling two work loads a day on top of everything else going on.— Kaylee Tener, Holicong Middle School
‘I’ve noticed that staying on task gets harder as the week goes on.’The only thing familiar about my “school days” is getting up in the morning. The similarities come to an abrupt stop there. I eat breakfast each morning with my mom, who now works from home, and converse with her frequently throughout the day. Having a chance to connect with her in this way has is something I am grateful for. During the scheduled lunch break my school includes in its remote learning class schedule, I frequently take naps, mostly out of boredom. Far more distractions — my pet and the availability of food all the time, to name a few — abound as I try to remain engaged in classes and complete assignments. For the most part I am on task, but some of the very same distractions I deal with in school, such as receiving texts from friends or my phone serving as a distraction in and of itself — seem much harder to resist at home. For the most part, though, as a high school senior, I know and accept what work I have to complete and I return to the tried and tested routines that have served me well throughout my high school years.— Aaliyah Rogers, Martin Luther School-Maspeth, Queens, NY
A school day for me is very different than what I’m used to. I now wake up an hour after I would normally be getting to school, so that’s three hours of extra sleep. I think because of this, my sleep schedule is messed up and I don’t have the structure we used to all get. I’ve noticed that staying on task gets harder as the week goes on. We’re obviously not at school working with our classmates and teachers, so it is hard for me to focus … There’s no structure, which is making it hard to get up and be productive. Overall, online school makes time management extremely difficult and I feel like I’m not even learning in some of my classes.— Riley S, Brooklyn, NY
‘How harshly are AP exams going to be graded now?’Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Collegeboard announced massive changes to the AP tests: students only have 45 minutes, the tests are now only free response questions, and the major twist, the exams are now online. With this new information, as well as the fact that Collegeboard cut down on the curriculum we are being tested on, many of my classes switched from learning new material to review mode. Instead of preparing for multiple choice questions, I must now scramble to prepare for a writing only test that will determine my fate on whether I receive college credit for the many AP classes I have spent a year taking. My biggest fear now is that it is unknown how the new shortened tests will be graded, leaving me with only the written portion to get a good score on the exam. This added stress was not something I needed in an already stressful year.— Ryan C, Dawson High School
As a junior, I have been very stressed about how the rest of the school year will pan out. Constant thoughts running through my head are, “When am I going to take the SAT? How harshly are AP exams going to be graded now? What are colleges going to do for admissions next year?” All of these questions are constant thoughts that most teenagers my age are thinking about right now. The work that we are being provided with now is only supplementary; which, does not help students stay motivated to get their work completed. Teachers are doing the best they can but the ones who truly care about their students’ mental health and education are putting in extra time just to help. Sadly, I have one teacher who I know I can count on to go to because she has been sending out constant emails about our AP exams and always asking how we are doing. If as many teachers cared as much as she did, then maybe more students would want to do their work …— Amaya Lancaster, Branham High School, San Jose, CA
‘I feel for our teachers who have had to change everything about their classes.’Luckily I have pretty good computer knowledge, but like Ms. Goldstein pointed out, I feel for our teachers who have had to change everything about their classes. Asking teachers to all of sudden offer the same kind of curriculum online is impossible, so it is important we stay patient … I’m not really thinking about what I need from my teachers as much as what our teachers need from us. All we have to do is stay on task and take this seriously while they have to change their jobs from in school to online in a matter of days. The workload isn’t unbearable and the teachers are very lenient, but as long as we don’t take advantage of this and stay diligent we can all get through this.— Estevan, Corpus Christi, Texas"
