The Minneapolis-based retailer announced Wednesday that its Drive Up curbside pickup, in-store pickup and Shipt delivery grew by 278% in the three-month quarter, which ended May 2. The company said comparable sales, which included online purchases, increased 10.8% for the quarter.

""Throughout the first quarter, our team and guests faced unprecedented challenges arising from the spread of COVID-19,"" Target chairman and CEO Brian Cornell said in a news release.

Digital sales boost:Walmart sales increase 10% as online buying grew 74% during coronavirus pandemic

Digital sales accelerated every month in the quarter and went from 33% in February to 282% in April compared to sales in the same time period last year, Target said, noting 80% of online orders were shipped from stores.

Cornell said during an earnings call that as shelter-in-place rules were adopted across the country, shoppers began to pull back on in-store shopping and the company saw a dramatic surge in digital traffic and sales.

“We also began seeing higher demand for products oriented around staying at home, including home office products, video games, puzzles, and board games, along with the housewares and kitchenware,” Cornell said.

Target reported revenue of $19.62 billion, up 11.3% over the same period a year ago. Net income fell 64% to $284 million.

The company did report higher expenses due to COVID-19 including employee wages and benefits.

Target announced Monday that it was extending the $2 an hour temporary wage increase for employees through July 4, which is two months longer than originally announced. The company is also continuing to offer access to a paid leave program for workers most susceptible to the coronavirus through the end of June.

Target also extended the two initiatives in April and officials have said the company is spending $500 million in temporary benefits, wages and bonuses for workers.

Shares of Target stock were down more than 2% as of 10:45 a.m. Wednesday.
