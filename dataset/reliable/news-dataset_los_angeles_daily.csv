“The harm children are facing is just as real a threat to them as is the coronavirus,” he said in a prepared weekly address.

Beutner added that state and federal governments “jumped into action” to support patients who became ill and pour funding to make sure hospitals were adequately funded and staffed.

“We are looking at the same challenge in public education and we need the same full-throated response to the education crisis which looms ahead,” he said. “Governments have established virus task forces and job task forces. Where’s the education task force?”

The announcement comes days after Gov. Gavin Newsom said that decline of state revenues could force the state to cut funding for K-12 by nearly 10%. A recent revenue and funding forest released earlier this month from the governor’s office found that K-12 school districts could see funding cut by more than $18 billion.

Beutner didn’t disclose how cuts would impact the district’s operations but said details would be available in the coming days and weeks.

The pandemic is taking a toll on many families who have been struggling financially, he said on Monday.

Before the outbreak hit, forcing schools to close about two months ago, 70% of families reported a household income of less than $50,000 and 35% less than $25,000, Beutner said. Recently, 57% of families reported that one or more individuals in their household have lost their job after the pandemic broke out.

“Most families were struggling to get by before this crisis and for more than half of them, their situation has gotten worse,” he said.

Nearly every LAUSD student is now participating in online learning, school officials announced last week, but “a login on a computer doesn’t necessarily mean a student is engaged and learning,” Beutner said. These days, teachers are being trained with the focus on shifting to keeping students engaged in their studies, he added.

The level of engagement in classrooms and schools varies a great deal, he said, as teachers from “all schools will continue to reach out to students and encourage them to participate, just as they would in a classroom.”

Beutner also discussed the efforts to assist students who are learning English. The district has nearly 100,000 English learners and their families have received materials with conversation skills, literacy and math in both English and Spanish, similar to those used in classrooms.

On Monday, the district released the results of a survey to study the needs of nearly 12,000 families in East Los Angeles completed in early May, which found that roughly 75% felt schools and the district are doing a good job handling the crisis, officials said. About 80% of the families are receiving help three or more times a week from schools, including homework and health care and food.

Beutner pointed out that the biggest challenge for families was access to the internet and technology, with 50% lacking reliable internet and 25% a device.",100,High,Right-center

Here is the latest as of Thursday, May 21.

Health officials have been cautioning all along that the number of confirmed cases, and the list of locations, don’t show the disease’s true prevalence. Researchers working in L.A. County found in April that the number of people who have actually contracted COVID-19 was probably 28 to 55 times higher than the number of confirmed cases.

As of Thursday, 42,138 people have tested positive for COVID-19 since the outbreak began, up 3% (1,163 cases) from the day before and 19% from a week before. That is based on the latest reports from L.A. County and the cities of Long Beach and Pasadena, which have their own health departments and are typically at least a day ahead of the county in reporting their cities’ numbers.

Another 45 deaths were announced Thursday, bringing the county’s toll to 2,021.

So far, about 403,000 people have been tested for the coronavirus in L.A. County. That represents 3.96% of the county’s population.

County officials are releasing some additional information that does not include the cases in Long Beach and Pasadena.

Hospitalizations:

An average of 1,532 people per day have been hospitalized over the past three days.

6,026 patients have been hospitalized since the outbreak began. That’s 60 new hospitalizations reported since the day before.

The number of fatalities linked to the coronavirus as of Thursday was 2,016.

“This is a very sad milestone for us. To those of you suffering and grieving,” the county’s Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said during a Thursday afternoon briefing, “we offer our deepest condolences. We are thinking of you and your families every single day.”

The county also announced 1,204 new cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, bringing the total number of infections so far to 42,307.

The mid-day total did not include updated numbers for Pasadena and Long Beach. Both cities have their own health departments, unlike every other city in the county, and have been managing their own local response to COVID-19. Long Beach reported three new deaths, bringing the city’s total to 68, and 95 new cases for a total of 1,495. Pasadena reported six new cases, for a total of 790 and two new deaths, for a total of 79.

Of the newly reported deaths in LA County, 28 were over the age of 65, 20 of whom had underlying health conditions; 12 were between the ages of 41 and 65, 10 of whom had underlying health conditions. County officials did not have details on the six remaining fatalities other than to say three occurred in Long Beach, and the other three happened in Pasadena.

Of all of the people who have died in the county from coronavirus-related causes, about 39% were Latino, 29% were white, 17% were Asian, 12% were African American, 1% were Native Hawaiian or Pacific Islander and 1% identified as another race.

About 92% of people who have died after testing positive for COVID-19 have had underlying health conditions.

More than 403,000 COVID-19 tests have been administered in the county, Ferrer said, and about 9% of those people have tested positive for the virus.

As Los Angeles County moves forward with lifting closures that were intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus, Ferrer said officials are keeping a close eye on the number of cases and deaths, as well as indicators like hospital capacity and the availability of personal protective equipment for frontline workers.

Most of those measures are headed in the right direction, she said. The transmission rate has declined from one person with the virus infecting about three other people to one person with the virus infecting one other person on average, she said.

“This is very good news, and it shows that what we’re doing over past few weeks — staying home, physical distancing, wearing our cloth face coverings — has resulted in a reduced number of infections from what we would have had had we not taken any action.”

The average number of deaths per day is also shrinking, and officials are meeting their target for contact tracing, which is to follow up with every new case within one day of receiving that information, Ferrer said.

“As a community, we’ve done this together,” she said, “and this progress is a direct reflection of what all of you in your day-to-day lives have been able to accomplish.”

Moving forward, she said, it will be important for people to continue taking those precautions as they take advantage of opportunities to get outside.

“As we hike our trails, go to our beaches and use our other outdoor spaces, we can all take responsibility for creating safety for the people who work at those sites and others who are using these spaces,” she said. “I know we can do this. Of this I’m certain because we’ve done it. We’ve worked together. We’ve been doing our part, and we’ve saved lives as a result.”",100,High,Right-center

Ventura and Santa Barbara got the green light under Gov. Gavin Newsom’s newly amended criteria that accounts for regional variance among the state’s 58 counties, some of which say they are more ready than others to re-open economies and ease stay-home restrictions in place since March.

Under the new criteria, counties must show evidence of meeting key benchmarks to move more quickly. For example:

The county must meet one of these goals that show hospitalizations have stabilized:

The number of COVID-19 patients hospitalized each day can’t go up by more than 5%, averaged over seven days.

Or, there can be no more than 20 COVID-19 hospitalizations on any single day during a 14-day period. (This is meant for smaller counties.)

It also must meet one of these goals related to confirmed cases:

Fewer than 25 new cases per 100,000 residents in the past 14 days, or

Less than 8% of all people whose test results came back in the past seven days were positive.

And it must achieve this goal related to testing:

A minimum daily testing volume of 1.5 people tested per 1,000 residents per day, averaged over seven days.

Other benchmarks include creating a plan for contract tracing and the workforce capacity for the effort; providing proof that it enough availability temporary housing units to shelter at least 15% of its homeless; securing a strategy for protecting vulnerable communities, such as people in nursing homes; delivering a timeline for opening all the categories of businesses in Phase 2; and doing the math to show the metrics that would use to measure if it’s time re-tighten restrictions.

In attesting to meeting the benchmarks, Ventura County Health Officer Dr. Robert Levin noted that the average number of patients hospitalized had fallen by 3.4% over seven days ending on May 16; that the cumulative incidence rate over 14 days was at 16.6 per 100,000 residents and that it’s testing capacity — at 1,360 tests per day — remains well above the bencmark of 1,280 tests per day. The county’s volume had not matched its capacity because the Safer-at-Home order has kept the number of symptomatic people needing testing low. But the county was able to show a plan to increase testing, including surveillance testing of vulnerable populations. That will help the county meet the state’s required volume, according to Ventura officials.

Ventura County joins 38 of the state’s 58 counties aiming to move forward quickly in what is called Accelerated Phase 2 of a 4-phase process to ease restrictions that have shut down economies in the effort to contain the spread of the coronavirus. That effort has worked to flatten the curve, public health officials say. But it’s also devastated local economies and government budgets, prompting renewed efforts to re-open sooner in areas where that can happen.

Moving further down Stage 2 allows for counties to open up “destination retail (retail stores), including shopping malls and swap meets; dine-in restaurants (other amenities, like bars or gaming areas, are not permitted in Stage 2); and schools with modifications. All this, along with the already allowed curbside retail and other services, such as car washes and pet grooming.

L.A. County — with its 10 million residents — includes nearly 50% of the state’s cases and nearly 60% of its deaths. Nonetheless, it is making progress toward meeting Newsom’s criteria:

Hospitalization: The county’s rate hasn’t just stabilized, it’s been trending down — from 1,742 people on May 14 to 1,516 people on May 21. That comes to a daily average of -1.6%, well under the benchmark.

Confirmed cases: L.A. County would have to drop below 2,543 new cases in two weeks to meet this criteria through the first option — five times lower than its current two-week total. But it can meet the criteria through the second option — only about 5% of test results the county has received in the past week have been positive.

L.A. County needs to average 15,259 tests per day to meet this. Just this week, it has started hitting that target — it’s gotten results back for an average of 18,714 tests in the past seven days, officials have said.

County officials say they are trying to balance the urgency to re-open the region’s economy while also sticking to public health goals to avoid a resurgence in the disease.

In Ventura, officials will start by opening with dine-in restaurants and in-store shopping, which must observe social distancing orders. Destination shopping, such as malls, will not immediately open, according to the county’s plan.

“With reopening and more Ventura County residents coming into contact with one another, we are concerned that cases of COVID-19 may increase, along with hospitalizations, and even deaths,” Ventura officials’ opening plan notes.",100,High,Right-center

Disney, Universal, SeaWorld, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, Legoland and regional U.S. theme parks are expected to operate with social distancing-friendly attendance caps in place once they reopen following their extended coronavirus closures.

Post-COVID-19 theme park capacity limits will vary widely by state and change over time as each locale gets the coronavirus outbreak under control. But most parks are expected to reopen with limits of 25% to 75% of normal capacity.

But what does normal capacity mean? Is that the fire code limit for the park? A theoretical maximum capacity? Or the average daily attendance?

Florida’s Orange County Economic Recovery Task Force laid out preliminary plans for a phased reopening of theme parks in the Orlando area once the coronavirus crisis begins to wane. The Florida task force’s initial recommendations call for Disney World and Universal Orlando theme parks to reopen at 50% capacity in Phase 1 and at 75% in Phase 2.

California Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled a four-stage plan for reopening the state economy that didn’t specifically mention theme parks and offered no details on what restrictions would be put in place when Disneyland, Universal and other parks eventually reopen their gates. No post-COVID-19 reopening dates have been set for Disney, Universal and SeaWorld parks in California.

The Shanghai Disneyland theme park in China reopened to visitors with advance reservations on May 11. Attendance was limited to 24,000 visitors — 30% of Shanghai Disneyland’s 80,000 capacity. New Disney CEO Bob Chapek said actual attendance at Shanghai Disneyland would start “far below that” and increase by 5,000 visitors each week with the Chinese government’s permission.

SEE ALSO: First Florida theme parks set post-coronavirus reopening dates in June

Shanghai Disneyland’s 80,000-visitor capacity is similar to Disneyland’s estimated capacity.

Disneyland’s capacity was approximately 75,000 visitors before the addition of Galaxy’s Edge and is approximately 85,000 when you include the new 14-acre Star Wars themed land, according to Touring Plans, which uses big data and statistical analysis to calculate daily theme park crowd sizes.

An attendance cap of 25% would bring Disneyland’s theoretical COVID-19 capacity down to 21,250 visitors. A 50% cap would work out to 42,500 Disneyland visitors.

“That’s why the phased ‘50% capacity’ guideline doesn’t make a lot of sense,” Touring Plans president Len Testa said by email. “That’s probably pretty close to how many people are in the park at peak time during an average day.”

Disneyland attracts an average of 51,000 visitors per day, according to the Themed Entertainment Association.

“But all of those people aren’t in the park at the same time,” Testa said.

Testa estimates 45,000 visitors are in Disneyland at any one time on an average day.

Disney California Adventure attracts an average of 27,000 daily visitors, according to TEA. Touring Plans estimates the capacity for DCA at about 50,000 visitors.

DCA could allow 12,500 visitors a day with a 25% attendance cap and 25,000 with a 50% cap, based on Touring Plans estimates.

The reality is that Disney theme parks rarely reach capacity. Disneyland occasionally halts visitors from entering when the park reaches capacity during the busy Christmas holiday season.

The Walt Disney World resort in Florida attracts nearly a quarter million visitors per day, according to TEA. Disney World’s average daily attendance per TEA: Magic Kingdom (57,000), Disney’s Animal Kingdom (38,000), Epcot (34,000) and Disney’s Hollywood Studios (31,000).

Much like their California counterparts, Disney’s four Florida theme parks have a theoretical attendance capacity far greater than their average daily attendance.

Disney World’s estimated attendance capacity according to Touring Plans: Magic Kingdom (90,000), Disney’s Animal Kingdom (60,000), Epcot (110,000) and Disney’s Hollywood Studios (60,000).

Initial recommendations from the Florida task force call for Disney World’s four theme parks to reopen at 50% capacity before increasing to 75%.

Theoretical Disney World COVID-19 attendance caps based on Touring Plans capacity estimates:

Magic Kingdom: 45,000 (50%) and 67,500 (75%)

Disney’s Animal Kingdom: 30,000 (50%) and 45,000 (75%)

Epcot: 55,000 (50%) and 82,500 (75%)

Disney’s Hollywood Studios: 30,000 (50%) and 45,000 (75%)

SEE ALSO: Disney theme parks face $21 billion coronavirus loss through 2022, analysts warn

Calculating theme park capacity depends on two key factors: Open space and attraction capacity. A park like Disney’s Hollywood Studios might have room for 80,000 people, but only enough ride capacity to comfortably handle 60,000 visitors without wait times becoming excessive, Testa said.

“They don’t have enough rides or restaurants to support that level of attendance with reasonable waits,” Testa said via email. “So that’s what limits capacity.”

It’s impossible for the half a million motorists driving by the cemetery everyday on the 405 freeway – the nation’s busiest – not to be moved by the sight of 90,000 small flags rippling in the wind, commemorating the men and women service members buried there.

It’s an awesome sight. But, this year there will be no flags, no Boy or Girl Scouts kneeling at every gravesite and standing to salute them – no visual, emotional impact to make motorists driving by on the 405 snap out of their freeway trance, and feel a surge of national pride.

The coronavirus has seen to that, too.

“We can’t have a public celebration on Monday, either,” says Thomas Ruck, director of the national cemetery. “The National Cemetery Administration says we must follow the guidelines of the city we’re in, and Los Angeles has no gatherings of more than six people.”

Channel 7 is broadcasting a live ceremony Monday at 10 a.m. of speakers and patriotic singers on different stages socially distanced throughout the cemetery, but there will be no audience, no crowd to cheer.

Just TV cameras standing in for us.

Even if there was a way around it, Ruck says Boy Scout organizers have told him there normally would be 5,000 to 6,000 scouts signed up by now for the flag placement program on Saturday, but so far there’s less than 1,000 because parents are rightfully concerned.

They’d rather be safe than sorry, he says. Totally understandable. No one wants to put their kids in harms way.

“It is definitely disappointing to all of us in the scouting community,” says David Goldenberg, Memorial Day flag placement chairperson for the LA County Council of Boys Scouts of America.

“It’s been something like 30 to 40 years we’ve been doing this. It’s the largest yearly event where scouts come together from all the different organizations.

“Sure, people are concerned right now on what to do. Our whole scouting program has changed to being online to keep active and moving forward. If only one person got sick for coming out and participating in this (the flag placement), well…”

He didn’t need to say any more. It would be tragic.

“We’re working on plans now to have our scouts dress in uniform on Monday, go outside their homes at a designated time, salute the flag, and have a moment of silence, so we can do something” says Goldenberg, scoutmaster for troop 22 in Woodland Hills.

What can we, the public do? A person coming into the cemetery is only allowed to place a flag at the gravesite of a loved one, according to cemetery rules. No other graves.

It’s not the only Memorial Day event that’s had to shut down this year. It’s happening all over Southern California, with “virtual” events replacing the real thing.

The motion also calls for bringing in the county’s auditor-controller to ensure closer monitoring of skilled nursing facilities immediately. The inspector general would be tasked with developing recommendations on how to strengthen oversight for skilled nursing facilities, and how to improve their operations long-term, according to a statement.

Many skilled nursing homes get low marks for quality of care, patient satisfaction, and employee pay, the statement noted.

The Board of Supervisors will vote on the motion at their next meeting on Tuesday.

“While some skilled nursing homes may be doing their best to respond to COVID-19, we’ve seen hundreds of deaths at these facilities, tragically exposing the urgent need for stronger oversight across the industry,” Ridley-Thomas said. “Now, more than ever, we must act to address any questionable operations and substandard conditions in the facilities that care for some of our most vulnerable residents — the elderly, the low-income and the disabled.”

Barger added: “Skilled nursing facilities provide critical care and support for many of our most vulnerable populations. As the County fights the COVID-19 public health crisis, we must greatly improve our ability to assess and oversee these facilities to ensure the safety and well-being of all those who have been entrusted to their care.”

Skilled nursing facilities, which serve thousands of residents who tend to be older and medically fragile, have become the epicenter of L.A. County’s COVID-19 pandemic. As of May 18, 4,794 residents and 2,918 staff from these facilities have tested positive for the virus. Across L.A. County, 52 percent of all deaths from COVID-19 have been in institutional settings, particularly in skilled nursing facilities.

The L.A. County Department of Health Services director, Dr. Christina Ghaly, said that “It is our collective responsibility to protect and support the most vulnerable among us. Prioritizing the health and safety of those in our County’s skilled nursing facilities is the right thing to do and will also help protect the availability of hospital resources for all those who need them.”

The Ridley-Thomas/Barger motion says it is “critical that L.A. County learn the lessons of this crisis; identify the internal and external factors that have contributed to inadequate conditions within skilled nursing facilities; and provide oversight, accountability and resources as needed.”

They described the proposed inspector general as a ‘much-needed accountability measure” appointed to conduct an exhaustive review of L.A. County’s capacity to regulate skilled nursing facilities, recommend structural and operational changes, and outline a plan for ensuring adequate and sustainable oversight. They also plan to task the inspector general with recommending regulatory and policy improvements at the local, state and federal levels to enhance quality of care, ensuring adequate infection control measures, and supporting healthcare workers.

To increase transparency, the Ridley-Thomas/Barger motion also called for directing the L.A. County auditor-controller to take the lead in designing a publicly accessible dashboard with information about COVID-19 case totals, testing frequency, mitigation plan status, and other information. The motion seeks to find ways to enhance L.A. County’s ability to assess the adequacy of mitigation plans and to oversee their implementation.

Skilled nursing facilities have also received close attention from L.A. City government. Under an emergency order issued Friday by Mayor Eric Garcetti, skilled nursing facilities in Los Angeles will be required to provide diagnostic testing for COVID-19 for their employees, residents and contractors.

Nursing facilities, senior living homes and other facilities that care for people 65 and older have been potential “death traps,” Garcetti said.

Garcetti said the facilities can request assistance with testing from the city’s Emergency Operations Center if they’re unable to obtain it themselves. The tests will be required to be administered at least once a month.",100,High,Right-center

A news release said casino officials will look to local and state health and safety guidance to find a path to reopening and that while the casino could open on a June date, it is too early to tell.

“These business realities have forced the gut-wrenching decision that the Tribe has tried to avoid since the beginning of this pandemic: we have implemented furloughs and lay-offs for the first time in our 34-year history,” the release stated. “Those impacted have been notified and we are supporting them in navigating unemployment insurance, providing outplacement services, and assisting them in exploring opportunities with us in newly created positions including Social Distancing Ambassadors and Safety Concierges.”

In a YouTube video released Wednesday, Ken Ramirez, tribal chair for the San Manuel Band of Mission Indians, said tribal officials looked at other alternatives before having to lay off some of the casino’s team members and those included organization-wide pay reductions, eliminating nonessential expenses and delaying construction on San Manuel’s casino expansion and other capital projects.

Latisha Casas, treasurer for the San Manuel Band, said in the video that business could be impacted for some time.

“We are going to have to reopen in phases and we believe that demand from customers is going to take some time to come back,” Casas said. “So realistically, we could be over a year from meaningful recovery and in the meantime we’ll be operating a much smaller business.”

In anticipation of a possible June opening, the casino’s leadership will begin to recall team members to their positions. The release says those team members will have to be certified in the casino’s COVID-19 Health and Safety Training Program before they return to work.

In an email, Public Relations Manager Jenna Brady said it is unclear how many employees will be affected by furloughs and layoffs because casino officials don’t know how many team members will return to work, how many will attend the mandatory coronavirus training and how many will accept other roles within the organization, but said initial conversations concluded the casino would bring back the “the great majority of our workforce.”

Brady said that for employees who have been laid off, the casino is assisting with unemployment insurance, outplacement and connecting with other hiring organizations. It has established an assistance hotline and it will also work with laid-off workers to see if it can move them into newly created positions.

San Manuel, which closed March 15, has extended its closure as other casinos in the region have begun to reopen.

Pechanga Resort Casino; Cahuilla Casino Hotel; Soboba Casino Resort; Valley View Casino & Hotel; Harrah’s Resort Southern California; Spotlight 29 Casino; Tortoise Rock Casino and the Agua Caliente Casinos in Rancho Mirage and Palm Springs have all announced reopening plans.

Los Angeles may find itself in a worse financial situation than envisioned in the mayor’s proposed budget for the next fiscal year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, city officials said Thursdsay, May 21.

According to Chief Legislative Analyst Sharon Tso, the city’s Office of Finance is anticipating 2021 tax revenues will be a minimum of $45 million short of Mayor Eric Garcetti’s proposed budget and could fall short by as much as $400 million, depending upon how quickly the economy recovers.

“There is no doubt that we are going to be facing a difficult fiscal year,” Council President Nury Martinez said. “But even in difficult years, this council has delivered by focusing on the most vulnerable communities in our city. As we start the new fiscal year, it is important to keep in mind the people who need us the most right now.”

Although Los Angeles has been using financial tactics to pay for essential materials to combat the coronavirus pandemic, the lagging economy may not catch up fast enough before the city is forced to further dip into its reserves.

Councilman Paul Krekorian, the council’s Budget and Finance Committee chair, said that although tax returns for May have not been calculated, the city’s sales tax revenues were down 10% in March and 17% in April compared to last year, and the city’s hotel tax revenues were down 11% in March and 77% in April.

“The fear is that this is only going to get worse from here and that we’re going to be faced with even more difficult choices,” Councilman Bob Blumenfield said.

The budget process for Los Angeles will continue through June, as the city looks for ways to brace for the financial effects of COVID-19.

The Budget and Finance Committee is planning to meet June 8, 15, 22 and 29 to examine the budget, but Krekorian said it’s not possible to examine each department’s finances at great length this year.

“Even if we had considered all of those lengthy hearings that we typically have, the truth is the level of uncertainty over all of the assumptions that we rely on for our budget is greater now than it has ever been, probably in the city’s history,” Krekorian said.

Los Angeles’ entire budget is proposed to be about $10.5 billion for the next fiscal year, which begins July 1, with an operating general fund of about $6.6 billion.

Los Angeles has already spent $155 million in special fund loans on personal protective equipment and other COVID-19 preventions, but much of those funds could be reimbursed through Federal Emergency Management Agency funds.

Much of the funding for loans is coming from the Department of Building and Safety, and those loans have interest attached to them and must be repaid eventually.

Another $82 million from various funding sources has been used to cover COVID-19 testing kits, senior meals, small business micro loans and other programs.

COVID-19 testing has taken up more than half of those expenses at $43 million, and city officials said they’re trying to have the county take over its testing sites, as it may receive federal funding to do so.

Los Angeles estimates it will receive about $694 million in federal coronavirus relief, but those funds can be used only for responding to the virus and have to be spent by the end of 2020.

The funds cannot be used to replenish revenues the city anticipated it would have received prior to the pandemic.

“We really need to spend those dollars on COVID-specific responses within that time frame,” said Matthew Szabo, Mayor Eric Garcetti’s deputy chief of staff.

But the city has already had to dip into its reserves, which have fallen from a “robust” 8.5% of the general fund, about $407 million, and will likely be down to 3.6%, or $243 million, by the start of the next fiscal year. City Administrative Officer Richard Llewellyn said the reserves are “dangerously low.”

Los Angeles was facing difficult budget decisions prior to the pandemic related to pay raises and contracts with public safety departments, which make up most of the city’s operating budget.

The Los Angeles Police Department’s budget for this year was about $1.73 billion, and next year it is expected to be increase to $1.85 billion.

Public speakers said Wednesday and Thursday they opposed the proposal to increase the LAPD budget, contending that the money should be used for housing and COVID-19 prevention efforts.

Councilman Mike Bonin asked if there was a way to defer pay raises in response to the pandemic. Neither the LAPD nor Los Angeles Fire Department budgets are in line to see decreases compared to this year.

Llewellyn said he did not want to discuss labor negotiations in a public setting, but “everything is on the table.”

Some notable services that are expected to be reduced include capital improvement projects, graffiti abatement, tree services, animal sterilization and the mayor’s Gang Reeducation and Youth Development program.

“Our effort here … was to not cut entirely or eliminate any particular portion of a department or a program, but to try to manage the reductions across the city,” Szabo said.

The city has enacted a hiring freeze, estimated to save $42 million next year, and it plans to furlough 15,000 of its civilian employees for 26 days next year to save $139 million.

Councilman David Ryu said as the city considers the budget, it should not make cuts to services that help homeless people, the elderly, victims of domestic violence and other vulnerable populations.

“If we make cuts to departments and services that serve low-income and working families, we will be paying for those cuts for decades to come,” Ryu said.",100,High,Right-center

The report, based on a study of COVID-19 exposure by six different age groups, found that almost in every age category, Latinos, African Americans and Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islanders have higher case rates for COVID-19 than whites. This is an indicator that these racial populations are experiencing varying degrees of greater exposure to the virus than whites, said David E. Hayes-Bautista, professor of medicine and the center’s director.

For example, in the 0-17 age group, Latinos have the highest number of cases, with 31.8 per 100,000 people compared to 8.6 cases among whites. In the 18-34 age group, Pacific Islanders have nearly 300 cases per 100,000 compared to 72.9 among whites. The number of coronavirus cases gets higher among Latinos, African Americans and Pacific Islanders as the age of the individuals increases.

Latinos, in particular, are vulnerable because they serve in a lot of jobs at essential businesses, Hayes-Bautista said.

“They are the farm workers who grow and pick food, meat packers, truck drivers, grocery stockers, checkout clerks, auto mechanics, bus drivers and attendants in nursing homes,” he said. “They have a high rate of exposure. But they were also the last ones to get personal protective equipment like masks and gloves. So it’s not surprising at all that they have higher case rates.”

Latinos and Asians also tend to “live more densely,” and often multiple generations share the same home, Hayes-Bautista said.

“The cost of housing in California is horrendously high and wages for these essential workers are not very high,” he said. “So you have senior citizens, younger wage earners and children living together. When the wage earners or essential workers go to work and come back home, they are likely infecting the others in the home.”

New statistics released by the APM Research Lab on Wednesday, May 20, titled “The Color of Coronavirus,” showed that, nationwide, African Americans have died at a rate of 50.3 per 100,000 people compared with 20.7 for whites, 22.9 for Latinos and 22.7 for Asian Americans. Nationwide, more than 20,000 African Americans have died from the coronavirus.

Minority populations also suffer as a result of not being able to afford health insurance or obtain it because they are undocumented. Luz Gallegos, community programs director at the TODEC Legal Center, a Perris-based immigrant assistance group, said Latino immigrants, in particular, have been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic because of the Trump administration’s public charge rule that could deny green cards to immigrants who use social services such as food stamps, cash assistance or public housing, she said.

“People don’t want to get tested or be on the radar as having tested positive,” she said. “So they are spreading the virus within their families or within local communities.”

Coronavirus-jolted finances may be worse than feared, LA officials say While immigration officials have issued statements saying undocumented individuals will not be penalized for getting coronavirus testing and treatment, immigration raids and fears of deportation have made the community extremely skeptical of the government, Gallegos said.

Members of the undocumented community perform essential jobs, she said.

“They are risking their lives in the fields so we can all have food. But when it comes to health care and unemployment benefits, they get little to none,” Gallegos said. “They file taxes, but don’t get stimulus checks. It breaks my heart to see these families suffering so much.”

CVS is opening 14 more drive-thru sites in California where people can self-administer the nasal swab test for diagnosing active virus, even as more antibody tests — designed to detect past infections — come to consumers. The pharmacy chain promised more drive-thru sites by the end of May, aiming for 1,000 COVID-19 testing sites nationwide.

Exer Urgent Care is among those offering both swab and antibody tests at its 16 sites in the Los Angeles area as well.

Lab kits for home tests can be shipped directly to your home, then popped back into the mail.

Experts say much more testing is needed to understand how widespread the virus has become, to swiftly spot outbreaks, and then to isolate and contain them. That could help save lives — but consumers should proceed with caution.

Self-swab diagnostic

As of Friday, May 22, the self-swab diagnostic tests will be available by appointment at CVS stores in in Costa Mesa (1150 Baker St.), Eastvale (14220 Schleisman Road), Riverside (491 E. Alessandro Blvd.), Seal Beach (921 Pacific Coast Highway) and Yorba Linda (18080 Imperial Highway).

To get an appointment, folks must meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria — symptoms including fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, muscle pain, new loss of taste or smell, vomiting or diarrhea, and/or sore throat; or asymptomatic people prioritized by health officials, such as frontline workers who may have been exposed to the virus.

People must register in advance at cvs.com/minuteclinic/covid-19-testing. The company aims to have more than half of its test sites in vulnerable communities, as measured by poverty rates, access to transportation and housing density.

The self-swab tests will be processed by an independent third-party lab, with results available in about three days, officials said.

Cost? CVS will accept insurance at the drive-thru test sites, but, under the Families First Coronavirus Response Act approved by Congress, patients should not have any out-of-pocket costs with their insurance. Uninsured patients will be covered under a program funded by the Department of Health and Human Services, officials said.

Some physicians are leery about self-swab tests. Swabs must gather good samples to be accurate, and one doctor likened the swabbing process to a “brain biopsy” and fears people won’t self-swab as thoroughly as necessary. That could lead to negative test results in people who might be positive for COVID-19.

CVS officials said that, “According to the CDC, a self-administered nasal swab is similar to the more invasive nasopharyngeal swab in detecting coronavirus and has the benefit of being less invasive and easier to do.”

Team members inside stores and at pharmacy drive-thru windows will provide people with information on how to appropriately perform a self-swab, and will observe the process to ensure that it’s done properly, they said.

Blood tests

While diagnostic tests for active illness are becoming more available, blood tests — designed to find antibodies to past infections — are becoming more widely available as well.

LabCorp announced expanded access to its COVID-19 antibody test on May 5. People can get it via their doctors (in person or through a telemedicine program), and directly at www.LabCorp.com/antibody-testing, the company said.

Quest made antibody testing available to health care providers on April 21, and directly to consumers via QuestDirect on April 27.

Exer Urgent Care is offering antibody testing at 16 locations across Southern California, including Los Angeles, Pasadena, Manhattan Beach, Redondo Beach and Rolling Hills Estates. It offers nasal swab tests as well.

“In this global pandemic, antibody testing is becoming critical in helping us understand how widespread the virus may be and integral to helping us move forward and getting people back to work,” said Brian Wilbur, chief medical officer, by email.

After being slow to approve diagnostic tests for COVID-19, the FDA swung in the other direction with serology tests, allowing a flood of questionable tests onto the market without the usual validation. The FDA has since tightened up its requirements.

Right now, people should be seeking reliable and accurate COVID-19 tests with authorization from the FDA, and screening, education and counseling on the results should be part of the testing process, Wilbur said.

Proceed with caution

Doctors caution about reading too much into the results of serology tests.

People with antibodies should not assume that they’re immune to the virus and can swing back into their old lives — there’s not enough evidence to suggest a change in behavior is appropriate, researchers say.

The U.S. Government Accountability Office — America’s watchdog — worries about the varying accuracy of even the tests that have received emergency use authorization from the FDA.

“Testing provides critical information for a variety of purposes, including medical care, policymaking, and business,” it said in a “spotlight” report released May 20.

Testing helps determine risk, illuminates the disease’s impact, identifies those who may have been exposed but showed no symptoms as well as those who recovered, and can guide treatment and resource allocation by showing precisely where infections are happening. That informs decisions on quarantine and isolation, and on public responses such as school closures and re-openings.

“Although widespread testing offers a number of opportunities, there are also challenges in implementation,” the GAO said. “The performance characteristics of some COVID-19 tests have raised concerns about test accuracy. In particular, available data suggest variability in the rates of false positive and false negative results. This uncertainty can complicate patient treatment and public health decisions.”

Hundreds of protesters converged on Downtown L.A. on Friday, May 1, as tensions flared over stay-at-home orders that have exacerbated already raw political divisions across the nation.

For many downtown, those orders — staying home, staying at least six feet away from each other, wearing face masks and not gathering unless its for essential business — took a backseat to skirmishes, shouting matches and chants and strong emotions that boiled over in the heat of the Civic Center.

By noon, LAPD had moved in, looking to separate one group waving signs that said “Humanity First” and another with signs that said “America First.”

At one point, Spring Street in front of City Hall, had been closed between Temple Street and 1st Street as LAPD worked to contain what was at least three converging protests, dividing opposing protesters on either side of the roadway.

It was a mix of differing interests on what in the pre-COVID-19 era likely would have been a May Day pro-labor event with thousands on foot downtown advocating for worker and immigrant rights.

The rally decrying social distancing restrictions was designed to draw thousands to the Civic Center by foot and by vehicle, despite warnings from public health officials amid state, city and county guidelines aiming to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 1,000 people in the county.

The frustration was evident among those gathered at City Hall, where flag-waving demonstrators displayed signs with such messages as “Shutdown is Killing Small Biz” and “Freedom.”

“I just want to go back to work. To feed my family,” said Jared Clement, of San Pedro, who had come to join a group of protesters calling on local leaders to ease restrictions.

Many were draped in the American flag. Some wore masks. Others didn’t, defying public health orders. Others simply said being there was “freedom” -freedom to assemble.

Jessie Gates, 22, of Rancho Palos Verdes said her church in Torrance was affected by the orders, which have made it tough to worship.

“Democrats are terrible people,” said Kristy Reyes, 40, of San Bernardino. “They planned this, they did this.”

“Democrats are terrible people,” says Kristy Reyes, 40, of San Bernardino. “They planned this, they did this.” She says the health risks are fluffed up, and does not believe there have been 1,100 deaths from COVID-19 here in LA count. “If I get sick, I get sick. Life’s a risk.” pic.twitter.com/UzC7ff3I40 — Elizabeth Chou (@reporterliz) May 1, 2020

She said the health risks are exaggerated, and did not believe there have been 1,172 deaths from COVID-19 in LA County from the virus.

“If I get sick, I get sick. Life’s a risk,” she said.

At one point, some in the group started chanting “Four More Years.”

But wearing masks, and holding banners, counterprotesters moved in not long afterward.

“What they are advocating will spell mass death,” said Noche Diaz, with a group called RevCom, which was counter-protesting. He added that the while “we are trying to practice social distancing, we have been consistently attacked … .”

He blamed the anti-lockdown movement on President Donald Trump, but even as he spoke to a reporter through a facemask, another protester pushed back, saying “I’m not with Trump.”

In response to protests throughout California, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Friday said, “All I ask for is this: Take care of yourself. Do justice to physical distancing. You don’t want to contract this disease. .. Just protect yourself. Protect your family…. the people you are protesting with and thank them fror their expression of free speech.”

But he did not suggest any legal actions for violating restriction orders.

“If you look at those death certificates, all Americans are represented in terms of that tragic loss of life, regardless of their political stripes.”

Still, there was concern among local officials that the rallies were defeating the public health purpose even while acknowledging the right to protest.

“If they were practicing social distancing and wearing masks,” said L.A. County Supervisor Kathryn Barger. “I’m sure there would be a lot more sympathy. “Crowds that are not wearing masks, that are literally on top of each other protesting, it doesn’t further their cause.

“And it actually, to me, makes the argument the governor was making: When you don’t social distance and you don’t practice safe social distancing, you are continuing to the spread of this virus.”

A similar protest was planned in Orange County, where Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered beaches closed after last weekend’s re-opening drew crowds and spurred concerns about a lack of social distancing.

Meanwhile, the LA street vendor caravan has arrived to the Dept of Public Works building downtown. They're demanding financial assistance and an end to fines on vendors choosing to work without a permit during the crisis #MayDay pic.twitter.com/kTiyD4TjLj — Ariella Plachta (@AriPlachta) May 1, 2020

A third group — a caravan of street vendors that had come from five points in the city — was also rolling through. That group was demanding relief from public officials over how the pandemic has crippled their business. But they got caught in the middle of the competing demonstrations.

At one point, police told them to move off of Spring Street, where dozens of cars and trucks had rolled through. They were headed to the front of the city’s Department of Public Works and its Bureau of Street Services. But ended up making their demands in front of the L.A. County Board of Supervisor’s building.

The anti-lockdown group was demanding L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti and Gov. Newsom:

Lift the lockdown on non-essential businesses, which the group said is unconstitutional and has caused unemployment to skyrocket and businesses to permanently close;

End shelter-in-place orders, which the group said have resulted in hunger and mental illness, prompted by isolation;

Leave the choice of wearing protective attire, such as face masks, up to the individual; and

Open all state and city parks, beaches, golf courses and other facilities.

“We’re just defending our constitutional rights,” said Juliet Annerino, who helped organize the noon demonstration.

Police said they’ve seen much worse, and for the most part let the tension play out.

“You’re going to have some tension at protests,” LAPD Officer Drake Madison said, adding for the most part the rallies were peaceful. “But that’s why they’re protests, people are exercising their rights. We’re just here to help them facilitate, and there were no issues.”

The anti-stay-at-home rally came on the heels of another rally last month in Huntington Beach that was largely peaceful but did result in some tension and one arrest.

Such rallies have popped up across the country as lawmakers echo warnings from public health officials that easing social distancing restrictions too quickly could refuel the virus that feeds off of crowded settings.

As it stands, Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said the county’s order — which began on March 19 and was extended until May 15 — has been working to contain the spread, according to the county’s statistical models.

Such orders have not persuaded such groups around the nation, however.

Thousands of flag-waving, honking protesters drove past the Michigan Capitol in mid-April to show their displeasure with the state’s Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s orders to keep people at home and businesses locked. On Thursday, a mostly peaceful repeat demonstration led to some angry protesters — many without face coverings and some with guns — entering the Michigan Capitol and demanding to be let onto the House floor, which is not allowed.",100,High,Right-center

Col. Sam Sachs could not believe his eyes.

Stretching for almost two miles were more than 300 vehicles — decorated with balloons, American flags and hand-made signs, all wishing Sachs a happy 105th birthday. Drivers honked, passengers whooped and waved flags as they slowly rolled by on Conquista Avenue.

A musician leaned out of his car and played the official U.S. Army theme on his trumpet. Sachs, a veteran of World War II who participated in the Normandy invasion on D-Day June 6, 1944, responded with a salute.

A Los Angeles County Sheriff’s helicopter hovered overhead and police and fire sirens erupted in a crazy kind of unison.

Kate Smith’s rendition of “God Bless America,” blared over loudspeakers.

More than 200 flags were placed in the ground in the front yard.

The voice of Frank Sinatra crooned “Young at Heart.” After all, Sam said the lyric “…and if you should survive to 105, think of all you’ll derive out of being alive” inspired him to stay put on the planet for as long as he has.

More than 150 neighbors and well-wishers, most wearing masks because of the coronavirus crisis and striving to keep their distance, applauded and shouted out as cars passed by.

Sachs, who stood for 90 minutes while leaning on a railing, was clearly moved by the demonstration of love.

“Today has just been overwhelming,” he said. “This is the best birthday party I have ever had. How many times can I say thank you to all of you?”

Every variety of birthday card — more than 6,000 of them — were displayed on tables in the driveway. And that’s sort of where this ultimate birthday party was born.

Ivonne Meader, owner and administrator of the Mom and Dad’s House facility where Sam lives, realized that “Safer At Home” measures were sure to prevent a traditional gathering for his birthday.

Meader posted a video of Sachs telling his story on YouTube, and urging folks to send birthday cards. Surely a few dozen would arrive. The video went viral, was reported upon by every media outlet imaginable and even wooed local government to get involved, with Lakewood Mayor Todd Rogers and the City Council taking up the crusade.

The cards poured in from every state in the nation, we well as from England, Canada and South Korea.

One of the cards: A hand-signed note from President Donald Trump, who thanked Sachs for service to his country.

Michael R. Brown, the mayor of Grand Forks, North Dakota, where Sachs was born and raised, sent word that Sachs’s birthday was declared “Sam Sachs Day” in the city.

“Unbelievable,” Sachs kept saying from his porch as the parade — ranging from classic cars of the Sultans Car Club to hot rods to soccer-mom minivans, pickup trucks and first responder vehicles — rolled on for more than an hour.

Some observers opined that the parade must have been one of the longest, if not the longest, drive-by celebration, suddenly a Southern California tradition amid the pandemic.

Rick Smith, president of the Sultans — who was driving a white 1955 Chevrolet — said the club felt honored to celebrate Sachs’s life.

Doug Vaughn, an original member of the Sultans — driving a 1952 purple deluxe Chevrolet coupe — said he and many of the Sultans were veterans who were grateful for his service.

On June 6, 1944, Sachs was the lead officer in a glider with the grim nickname of “Flying Coffin” because it had no weapons to protect itself from enemy fire during the mammoth, historic D-Day invasion of Normandy. His glider was filled with machine guns, ammunition and eight soldiers whose job was to land behind enemy lines and destroy German defenses. He survived the bloody assault, which cost thousands of lives on both sides, but was pivotal in securing World War II victory for the Allies.

“We love you, Sam!” said one handmade sign held by a young boy who leaned out oft the window of an SUV.

A pickup truck went by painted entirely in the colors of the Los Angeles Rams football team and bearing the team logo.

Steve Leff, a retired Anaheim police officer now living in Riverside, gave Sachs a wooden plaque recognizing his time with the 82nd Airborne Division.

“This day has brought tears to my eyes,” said Sharon Strong, a next-door neighbor of Sachs.

“He is such a great person,” said another neighbor, Nancy Tran. “He is so sweet and walks by our house every day for exercise. He always says hello.”

Samuella McMahon, another neighbor, was there with her children, Aiden, 11, Saoirse, 10, and Caoimhe, 5, who had made signs wishing Sachs a happy birthday.

Later in the afternoon, the city of Lakewood had a more formal program.

Mayor Rogers called Sachs “a true American hero.”

Rogers read aloud that proclamation from his counterpart in Grand Forks, where Sachs was born on April 26,1915.

Naresh Solanki, mayor of Cerritos, where Sachs lived for more than 50 years before moving into the assisted care home operated by Mom & Dad’s House in Lakewood, congratulated Sachs.

Specialist Raivyn Hearne from the 40th Infantry Division Band of the California Army National Guard belted out the National Anthem.

And then Hearne led the throng in one of the most anticipated, and most heartfelt, renditions of “Happy Birthday to You” ever sung.

Sachs ended the celebration by observing how the coronavirus crisis had brought “another level of reality to the world” but also “produced an unimaginable level of kindness to me and others.”

Did the day measure up? Sachs called it “the most magical time in my life.”

And he’ll be back for his 106th, he vowed.

“I hope I see all of you here again next year,” Sachs said with a smile. “I’m going to work on it.”",100,High,Right-center

Hands reached through open windows and received bags stuffed with goodness. The faces were covered in masks, but you could almost see the smiles behind them.

“Thank you” in several languages could be heard as people accepted the food with gratitude.

One of the appreciative recipients was Pacoima resident Yahaira Fuentes. ” We are very grateful to everyone that are volunteering and giving away to the community,” said the car detailer, who has had almost no work since the stay at home orders were initiated and was happy for the help feeding her family.

Councilwoman Monica Rodriguez, chair of the city’s Public Safety Committee, handed out out food and wished people well as they received their bags.

“We have a great deal of need; I think that COVID-19 has daylighted for a lot of families what we knew to be true — that a lot of families are housing and food insecure,” she said. “So we are helping to provide all the resources they need to get through these difficult times.”

The effort came out of the UK, the #LightItBlue volunteer effort has been organized in the U.S. by a collective of leaders from the events and entertainment industry. It was a way visualize their appreciation for what is now millions of Americans on the frontline of the crisis.

“We’ve been so inspired over the past few weeks by the cheers of our neighbors around the world – and we wanted to bring this collective gratitude to an even bigger stage here in the U.S.,” said lead organizer of the movement, Joe Zenas, CEO at Thinkwell Group, a design and production agency.

“This is a heartfelt ‘thank you’ from those of us at home to those of us who are going to work each day to keep our country going,” Zenas said.

All activations were executed using existing resources in accordance with local stay-at-home mandates. After this Thursday’s kickoff, the #LightItBlue effort will continue weekly on Thursday nights across the U.S.

Further down the street a “Star Wars” stormtrooper looking like he just came off of a movie set skateboarded down Hollywood Boulevard — in the center lane, with no traffic in sight.

Under normal circumstances, there would be no room to skateboard on the sidewalks or the streets anywhere near Hollywood Boulevard, which would be flooded with tour buses and bumper to bumper traffic.

During his press conference, Gov. Newsom said, “At some point in the future, we will need to modify our stay-at-home order. … As we contemplate reopening parts of our state, we must be guided by science and data, and we must understand that things will look different than before.”
