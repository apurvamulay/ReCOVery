The country, an epicenter of the pandemic, plans to be mostly reopened within the next few weeks, with strict health guidelines.

The Italian government plans to allow travel to and from the country beginning June 3, according to a new decree signed Saturday by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte. Citizens will also be able to travel freely within the country starting that same day.

Certain travel may still be limited based on disease risks, which will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. People who have tested positive for COVID-19 will still remain under strict quarantine orders.

The travel ban lifts the day after Italy's Republic Day, likely preventing mass travel over a long holiday weekend.

Italy's infection rate has fallen sharply in recent days. Despite calls for a quicker reopening, Conte said a gradual return to normalcy can help prevent a second wave of infections, Reuters reports.

Some shops in Italy start to reopen amid pandemic

According to the decree, all sectors of the economy still shuttered can reopen in June, as long as proper safety guidelines, social distancing and hygiene rules are adhered to. Health officials plan to closely monitor reopening in order to limit further infections.

The country maintained strict lockdown guidelines until May 4, when it allowed factories and parks to reopen. Shops plan to open May 18, and that same day, people will be able to move freely within their region.

Before coronavirus truly took hold in the United States, Italy had the highest number of COVID-19 infections in the world. It was the first European country to impose nationwide lockdown restrictions and has struggled for months to limit the virus' spread.

Italy currently has the fifth-highest number of confirmed infections globally with over 233,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases. It has the third-highest death toll, behind the U.S. and the U.K., with over 31,000 confirmed deaths.",100,High,Left-center

""You're going to see an increase in the numbers, but you don't want to see a spike,"" Cuomo said at his daily coronavirus briefing

Over 348,000 people in the state have now tested positive for the virus, with 2,419 new positives reported on Friday, according to the state's health department.

Five out of ten regions in New York have started to reopen, after they met seven criteria. ""Seven criteria, which basically measure the infection rate, hospitalization rate, testing rate, etcetera, and that's how the decision is made,"" Cuomo said Friday.

New York City has only met four out of the seven criteria, and is the only region to not meet the threshold of available ICU beds.

The state's shutdown will stay in effect until May 28 for the five other regions that are still closed, although any region can reopen earlier if it hits its ""benchmark.""

The governor said Saturday he expects more residents to leave their homes as the weather warms up, but urged people to continue to practice social distancing and wear masks when they are outside.

""How are they going to act when they come out? That is the big question,"" Cuomo said.

Cuomo announced on Friday that beaches in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Delaware will be open for Memorial Day weekend, allowing no more than 50% capacity. Contact activities - like football or volleyball - will not be allowed, and gathering places such as picnic areas and arcades will not be open, according to Cuomo.

The state has allowed horse and car racing tracks to reopen with no fans present, but said sports like baseball are not under its control. The governor said Saturday he is considering other economic activities that can reopen without crowds.",100,High,Left-center

Watch the latest episode, ""Coronavirus in Navajo Nation,"" in the video player above.

Navajo Nation is one of the hardest-hit regions per capita for coronavirus in the U.S. Despite its relatively low population density, this area has a higher coronavirus death rate than that of 46 states. CBS News spoke with Navajo Nation health care workers on the front lines. Here are three of their stories, in their own words.

Dr. Sophina Calderon

Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation, Tuba City

Dr. Sophina Calderon grew up in Navajo Nation and practices family medicine at Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation. CBS News

Dr. Calderon grew up outside of Tuba City in the Navajo Nation. She is a family medicine practitioner and the deputy chief of staff at Tuba City Regional Health Care Corporation. She is currently seeing patients in the emergency department after the surge in COVID-19 cases in Navajo Nation.



COVID-19 actually appeared at the beginning of March after a super-spreader event suspected of being a church rally that happened here in the Navajo Nation. People from all over actually went and attended this rally. Shortly after, we had our first suspected case here in Tuba City in mid-March. Since then, we've had a lot of those people fall ill and show up here at our facility.



That's when things changed significantly. Many of our regular [medical] services stopped to a halt, and we repurposed staff to set up an outdoor screening area. We repurposed our pediatric care unit to become our respiratory care unit. We have 24 beds in that unit, but our staff and nursing shortage significantly impacts how many we can actually admit and keep here. We can only fill about 15 beds.



Pre-COVID, a lot of the Indian Health Service Hospitals across the country have high [medical staff] vacancy rates already at baseline. And we've always been able to make do with that here, but once COVID hit, that deficiency just really became much more apparent.



Our most critical patients, the ones that are severely ill and need to be intubated, are transferred to Flagstaff and to Phoenix — areas far off the reservation. Every day we're intubating and sending out at least two to four patients a day. Our worst day that I can remember, we intubated and sent out about nine people, and that's all by chopper.

We could keep more critical patients here if we could increase our ICU nursing staff, critical care nursing staff, and if we could get an intensive care doctor. We have ventilators. We have space. We just don't have the staff to do it.



One of the things that break my heart is the number of people we need to transfer out every day. Families are left stranded from each other.



A lot of Navajo households are actually multigenerational. We deeply treasure families — large families. We live in the belief of a matrilineal clanship system, so who we consider family is far-reaching and extensive. But if someone falls ill, the rest of the household will get sick as well.



Families are hesitant to break themselves apart, send their grandparents elsewhere where it would be safer. They would much rather stay together, and to them, that's much more meaningful in this whole fight for survival here — to keep their families together.



I grew up without running water or electricity in a small area just right outside of town. My parents still live in that home. The pediatricians who took care of me while I was growing up are my colleagues now. The doctors who took care of my grandparents when diagnosed with cancer, those are my colleagues now too.



We have a vast number of very committed people making sure this hospital runs well. A lot of these doctors raised their own families here as well. Many of the people who work here are from this community. Our patients are our relatives.



When I help the epidemiology team sort through data, I look at these lists, and I recognize a lot of the names of patients. Some of them might be my primary care patients. Every once in a while I see my own relatives listed. That's really hard.



Many families are already greatly affected. A lot of the illness has actually clustered in some families. A parent, two children, and a brother — all in one family have died. It's something that really affects me significantly because I live here. My whole family is here.



We see New York, New Jersey, and Louisiana getting significant help from the government, whether it's PPE or staffing. I feel like we are this hidden hotspot pocket. We haven't seen nearly as much help as you see in these other places.



There is a huge feeling of isolation. Many families have voiced this feeling the government isn't aware of what's going on here? Doesn't anyone else see what's going on here?

Dr. Aaron Price

Tsehootsooi Medical Center, Fort Defiance

Dr. Aaron Price grew up in Fort Defiance in the Navajo Nation. He is the chief of internal medicine at Tsehootsooi Medical Center.



I remember when I was a little kid, if you were being bad, they would always threaten to take you to the hospital. They would say, ""Oh, if you're a bad kid, I'm going to take you to the hospitals, and they can give you a shot,"" almost like a form of punishment.



There is a stigma about patients going to the hospital and dying. You have to go back to the historical trauma that the Navajo people had to endure in years past. Once upon a time, hospitals were not really sanctuaries or a place you went for help, but rather someplace you went to die. Hospitals were sanitariums, and that lingers on in our elders, and it's passed on.



Unfortunately, in this pandemic, there's a good chance that you could get sick enough and end up in the hospital. Worst-case scenario, they get a breathing tube put down their throat. In most cases, once that happens, they're basically alone and it's a good chance they're also going to die alone as well. That's the fact of this condition. It's very unfortunate, but that's what we're seeing right now.



This really hits home to the model that was preached initially from day one — our drive is to flatten the curve. We [at Fort Defiance] have been at the tail end of the pandemic more than in the eye of the hurricane.



Circumstances here as a whole are looking pretty good, and we want to stay optimistic. There's not a lot of optimism happening right now. We won't know until it arrives, but right now, I feel like we have the capacity, the bandwidth, and the manpower to deal with that at this time.



For many years we've had very, very limited resources. For many years the pattern has been to send grandma off to the big city – to Phoenix, Albuquerque or Flagstaff — because they had the technology. They had the specialists to provide definitive care. I mean, imagine if you were sent somewhere where you had no inclination for the language, the customs, the norms and the expectations.



What's really compelling for me is, for the first time in a long time, reservation hospitals are rising to that occasion. [Tsehootsooi Medical Center] actually has the people with the training, and Navajo physicians at that.



I think the fact that you actually have someone who looks, talks and walks like you offers so much reassurance. That's a testament to how far we've come and the direction we're going. We're moving up.



Dr. Michelle Tom

Winslow Indian Health Care Center and Little Colorado Medical Clinic, Winslow

Dr. Michelle Tom grew up in Navajo Nation and now practices family medicine. CBS News

Dr. Michelle Tom grew up in the southern region of the Navajo Nation. After her medical training, she returned home to practice family medicine. She transitioned to treating patients in Winslow Indian Health Care Center's urgent care and Little Colorado Medical Clinic's emergency room after COVID-19 patients began arriving at both facilities.



As a family medical doctor, you treat everyone from infants to the elders. It's such an amazing atmosphere. You get to know entire families. It's always great when I have a grandmother call me her daughter or her child and thank me for doing what I do because they've never met a Navajo doctor before. It's a dream come true for me.



And you got to see them, their faces, and they got to see mine. We gave handshakes and hugs. All my elders gave me hugs before they left. The medicine I love, and that of my own experiences growing up with Native American healers, was about connection, about touch, sharing a close space and helping to heal. We don't have that anymore. It's off the telephone, it's between me and PPE, or a door.



Now when I'm in the hospital, urgent care, emergency room, I'm wondering if a COVID patient is going to come in. How am I going to prevent them from getting worse? Or am I going to lose this person now? Is it this time that I'm going to contract it? Physicians and nurses, we're struggling.



We don't have an ICU per se in our facility, so we have to transport critical patients.

Dr. Michelle Tom shows CBSN Originals' Adam Yamaguchi the urgent care facility where she works. CBS News

When a young person who was vibrant the week before comes in and we have to tell him if he goes on another liter of oxygen we're going to have to intubate and send him out to another facility — how do you tell him that? And then he asks, ""When will they take it out?"" And you have to be honest, and say you don't know. I don't know how to put that feeling into words. He's someone's son, someone's brother.

People in the U.S. want to reopen the country. I believe in a public health standard, and as a physician, I think it's too early. The cases are steadily still climbing in Navajo Nation.

We are a strong people. I think that's what I'm most proud of. But when you see a brother or sister, kinship, and they're asking for help and there's not much more you can do for them, it's something you're really never fully trained for.

I think it humbles me to know that I can do only so much, but I will do what I can while I'm here. I ask for guidance from my ancestors and my healers in the past who have passed onto the next life. Remembering them, honoring them when I pray.

All I know is what we have today — a hope that the attention will move Congress and our administration. We need more access to health care and infrastructure, water, plumbing, electricity, education, and jobs that will help feed families. These are huge issues that have been going on for so long. It's not going to happen overnight, but I am hopeful. We're getting there, slowly but surely. Hopefully, in my lifetime, it will change.

Just over 15% of women in the U.S. lost their jobs in April, compared to 13% of men — the first time an economic spiral has affected women, who were making big job gains until the crisis, worse than men.

""I worked… my son went to school, and all that's changed since the virus,"" Missouri mom Meghan Hiles told CBS News' consumer investigative correspondent Anna Werner.

Hiles worked as a massage therapist until she was furloughed on March 14. She said the spa she works for reopens June 1, but she worries for her and her 11-year-old son's health, because they both have asthma.

Hiles is also concerned for her stepmother, who has COPD and is her primary child care provider.

""If something were to happen to my stepmom, as in, I go in and I work on somebody, come to pick him up, and come over there and give something to her — if she died, I would feel terrible,"" she said.

More than 36 million Americans lost their jobs since the pandemic began. Experts say women have born the brunt of job losses because the industries that were hardest hit are ""hugely dominated by women"": leisure and hospitality, retail, education and health services.

""Think about who teaches, you know, grade school kids? Who works at a daycare center? Health care, who typically works in a doctor's office?"" economist Diane Lim, with the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said.

National Women's Law Center President and CEO Fatima Goss Graves said the crisis ""basically wiped out the job gains that women, and particularly black women, had since the last recession.""

The center ran an analysis that found roughly one in six black women and one in five Latino women are now unemployed.

""We don't know what the other side of this is going to look like,"" Goss Graves said.

New Jersey resident Simone Bailey found herself temporarily laid off from one of her hotel restaurant jobs. Her other new, full-time job was completely eliminated.

""We got called into the office and they let us know that we are laid off. Not even furloughed, just laid off,"" Bailey said.

The mother of two said the job losses left her feeling ""very displaced,"" and she has spent her time sewing face masks instead.

Bailey said her state unemployment check is just under $300 per week, and the extra federal money she was receiving only came for three weeks.

""I still don't see how I'm supposed to live,"" she said. ""And everybody else that I've worked with, all the other women that I was working with, it's the same thing.""

His first question was simple: ""Is my client alive?""

""I demand to speak with my client, today,"" Smallcomb continued. ""That is, assuming he is still alive.""

Smallcomb soon learned what he had suspected for days. In a brief call later that day, his client, 41-year-old Noe Perez, said he had contracted the coronavirus.

Perez, an immigrant from El Salvador, is one of at least 986 immigrants who have tested positive for COVID-19 while in ICE custody, according to the agency's latest tally. He is also among at least 149 ICE detainees who have contracted the disease while detained at the Otay Mesa Detention Center, a prison in the San Diego area that is home to the largest coronavirus outbreak in the U.S. immigration detention system.

At least 11 ICE employees assigned to the facility and 24 staffers with the for-profit prison company that runs it have also tested positive for the virus, according to the immigration agency and CoreCivic, the private corrections firm. Additionally, at least 68 U.S. Marshals Service detainees awaiting criminal trial or sentencing at the facility have tested positive, according to a Justice Department official.

The facility housed the first and only known immigrant to have died of coronavirus complications while in ICE custody.

Perez's family in California, a mix of U.S. citizens and green card holders, fears for his life. Before he contracted the virus, he was suffering from pulmonary embolism, thrombosis, ulcers and a hernia. He also has to take daily blood thinners for the rest of his life.

""I'm very worried about my son. My son is in danger,"" his mother, Laura, told CBS News in Spanish. ""We are all human beings. They are not animals. But they treat them like animals. They don't care about these boys.""

Laura, the rest of the family and Smallcomb feel like they have been stonewalled by ICE as Perez's health has deteriorated. They said the agency did not inform them of Perez's hospitalization until they spent days demanding answers. In one of his numerous emails to ICE officials in the San Diego area, Smallcomb said he and the family only found out about Perez's hospitalization through an anonymous source.

Asked about the family's concerns, an ICE spokesperson said the agency could not comment on Perez's medical condition, citing state and federal privacy laws. The spokesperson said requests to call hospitalized detainees have to be reviewed and approved by an ICE official.

Though relieved that he was able to speak to Perez on Wednesday, Smallcomb said there's no sign ICE will release his client. On Tuesday, the parole request he submitted on behalf of Perez was denied. In its decision notice, which was reviewed by CBS News, ICE said Perez's ""discretionary release"" would not ""conform to this agency's priority.""

An ICE spokesperson did not elaborate on why the agency denied the parole request. Notices typically state whether the agency believes a detainee could be a flight risk or a threat to public safety if released.

Smallcomb believes ICE is not releasing his medically vulnerable client because of a conviction for assault with a semi-automatic firearm in 1998. But he said his client has already paid his debt to society by serving a 22-year prison sentence. Perez was convicted as a teenager, according to California court records.

ICE confirmed it arrested Perez in January after he finished his prison sentence and is seeking to deport him to El Salvador, which he fled with his family in 1986 because of the civil war there.

Like Perez's family, Smallcomb fears for his client's life, saying he should be working to prevent Perez's deportation — not his death.

""A 41-year-old male with serious underlying conditions and daily medications to stay alive, that's the first guy you test, that's the first guy you quarantine, that's the first guy you release,"" Smallcomb told CBS News.

During his phone call with Perez on Wednesday, Smallcomb said he learned his client has been transferred to two San Diego-area hospitals since last Friday, after days of complaining of pain in his chest and lower back, excessive sweating and trouble breathing. Perez had been tested for coronavirus earlier last week and received the positive result the day he was hospitalized, Smallcomb said.

Since then, Perez has been diagnosed with pneumonia and two ""black clouds"" on his lungs, Smallcomb said, recounting the conversation with his client. Perez has begun an antibiotic regimen and remains in serious pain, his lawyer added.

Laura has been distraught since her son's health deteriorated. Not being able to talk to him on Mother's Day was particularly difficult. She faults ICE for his current condition, saying he felt ill for days before being taken to a hospital. ""If they had acted on time, my son would not be in the hospital.""

""What is ICE doing? Letting people die?"" she asked.

Laura has found some solace in talking to another immigrant family in California who recently faced a similar situation.

""My heart still hurts""

Rosa is still hurting from her brother's death. ""My heart still hurts. I can't sleep at night because I'm desperate,"" she told CBS News. ""I want to turn back time.""

She called Laura after the advocacy group Pueblos Sin Fronteras told her about Perez's situation. ""She's also devastated,"" Rosa said, referring to Laura.

Rosa, a Los Angeles resident who is also from El Salvador, lost her brother last week. Carlos Ernesto Escobar Mejía died of coronavirus complications at a San Diego-area hospital after being transferred there in late April from the Otay Mesa detention center, where he had been held by ICE since January.

Like Perez, Escobar Mejía fled El Salvador as a child during the 1980s. They both had run-ins with the law that made them targets for deportation. Escobar Mejía also had preexisting medical conditions and U.S. citizen family members clamoring for his release.

Rosa said she does not want other immigrants detained at the Otay Mesa facility to meet her brother's fate.

""My heart still aches. I don't want that to happen to other families. Please free them,"" she said, in a plea to the U.S. government.

According to an ICE spokeswoman, ICE has released more than 900 detainees it determined were at increased risk of severe illness if infected with the coronavirus because of their age or medical conditions. The agency has also been required to free more than 190 detainees under court orders stemming from lawsuits filed by advocates across the country.

Because of an order by a federal judge in San Diego, ICE has released 70 of the roughly 130 Otay Mesa detainees it identified as medically vulnerable, according to court filings. Last week, the same judge denied a separate request to order the release of at-risk U.S. Marshals detainees.

Bardis Vakili, an attorney with the San Diego branch of the American Civil Liberties Union working on both cases, said some immigrant detainees in the vulnerable categories are still waiting for medical clearance to be released. But he said the agency has indicated it does not intend to release about 35 medically at-risk detainees because of their criminal records.

Vakili said ICE needs to continue reducing the number of immigrants detained at the Otay Mesa facility, which stopped taking new detainees in April. ICE said it continues to hold roughly 544 detainees at the San Diego-area detention center.

""The main concern here is that these are buildings where everyone is in a congregate environment. They share bathrooms, showers, sleeping cells,"" Vakili told CBS News. ""They are packed tightly together.""

As coronavirus cases among detained immigrants have continued to grow consistently, advocates have urged ICE to further downsize its nationwide detainee population, which stood at nearly 28,000 last week, saying the agency is still detaining immigrants with medical conditions and others who don't pose a threat to the public.

In a letter Thursday, the House Oversight Committee accused ICE of not taking the crisis ""seriously,"" urging the agency to release all asylum-seekers and ""non-violent people"" in its custody.

In a court filing last week, the agency said it had identified more than 4,400 detainees considered to be at increased risk of severe illness or death if contracting the coronavirus under guidelines set by a federal judge in California. The agency also continues to detain more than 4,800 asylum-seekers who have demonstrated credible fear of being persecuted or tortured in their home countries.

Elsy, who requested that her last name not be published so she could speak freely, is one of many asylum-seekers held by ICE at Otay Mesa. She said she fled El Salvador last year after been threatened and marginalized because of her identity as a lesbian woman. She was required to wait in Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols program. She was only allowed into the U.S. after proving to an asylum officer that she had been persecuted while waiting in Mexico.

After the group representing her, the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, helped Elsy find a sponsor in the U.S., ICE granted her parole, but it conditioned her release on her paying a $15,000 bond. Because advocates have been unable to raise the funds, Elsy has been detained at Otay Mesa for roughly eight months. She said she has grown increasingly frustrated during the pandemic, feeling powerless to protect herself from the coronavirus inside a facility plagued by the contagion.

""I came fleeing to prevent something from happening to me in my home country,"" Elsy told CBS News. ""Now, I'm here in the U.S. in a detention center, but it's still very difficult because I don't know if I will come out of here alive or dead.""",100,High,Left-center

The agency notified authorities this week that it will no longer be able to support 140 of its 180 facilities in the country.

It's a new, imminent threat to medical care for women in a country ravaged by years of war and disease. The U.N. says tens of thousands of expectant mothers will be at risk of dying during childbirth if funding isn't secured.

UNFPA, the U.N.'s sexual and reproductive health agency, provides basic reproductive healthcare to hundreds of thousands of Yemeni women. The agency says that without its services, 320,000 pregnant women will be cut off from care and 48,000 could die from complications during delivery. The situation is only expected to worsen with the spread of the coronavirus.

""By cutting support to UNFPA, you've basically cut the umbilical cord of the reproductive health system in the country,"" Nestor Owomuhangi, representative for UNFPA in Yemen, told CBS News.

""It's grave,"" he said. ""It was bad before corona. We have weekly meetings, and… you can see an aura of hopelessness, given the corona that's knocking on our doors.""

World's worst humanitarian crisis

Before the coronavirus pandemic, aid groups were already calling the situation in Yemen the worst humanitarian crisis in the world. Years of brutal conflict between the Iran-backed Houthi rebels and the Saudi Arabia-backed government have decimated the country's infrastructure and led to widespread famine and disease.

""And then you have a situation where you have the coronavirus that has devastated the world, and for Yemen, we are looking at a population that has been resilient in a sense, but has gone through all kinds of catastrophes - of cholera and malnutrition - and therefore their immunity levels are low,"" Owomuhangi said.

People in Yemen already have very limited access to healthcare, with only about half of the health facilities functioning across the country. Of those, only 20% offer maternal and child health services - many of which are supported by UNFPA. If it is unable to raise more funds by July, it will be forced to close up to 90% of its services in Yemen.

""They have no health system, and there is no political organization to support them. So how hopeful are we? We only know that the hopes of the population are on us,"" Owomuhangi said.

Women's health and COVID-19

UNFPA operates a wide range of sexual and reproductive services in many countries, but in Yemen it focuses primarily on life-saving interventions during childbirth.

""It's already the minimum service,"" Arthur Erken, UNFPA's director of strategic partnerships and communications, told CBS News. ""These health facilities that lack staff, that lack supplies, that have been bombed or been severely damaged by the war, are already in a difficult state - these 140 need to stay open. Otherwise the consequences will be directly – the health and death will be directly a result of closing (them). Of course, if you have no money, that's pretty much end-of-story,"" he said.

Even before the coronavirus started spreading across the world, the agency didn't have enough funding to make it to the end of this year. When a donor conference was cancelled in April because of the pandemic, it left them in dire straits. UNFPA says it now needs $59 million to continue operations in Yemen until the end of 2020, plus another $24 million to deal with the extra burden of COVID-19 in the country.

""Women are pregnant. They were pregnant before the crisis. They're pregnant now. How do you deal with that?"" said Erken. He said the crisis can only be addressed by the international community collectively, and he urged nations to step up through the U.N., ""to make sure that being pregnant is not a death sentence in the coronavirus crisis.""

Only a few dozen cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in Yemen, but on Friday, the international healthcare nonprofit Doctors Without Borders said that, because testing capacity in the country is ""extremely limited, it is impossible to know the full extent of the spread of the virus."" The charity Save the Children said it has seen a surge in deaths of people with coronavirus symptoms in the southern city of Aden - approximately 50 people a day over the last week.

""Our hope is in the hope of the people who believe that we can make a difference,"" Owomuhangi said. ""And for that reason we have no choice but to believe that we can be able to provide support, whatever we can, not to let the population down.""",100,High,Left-center

However, Hahn said the agency recommends that the Abbott Laboratory test, which is used to test President Donald Trump and White House staffers, still be available for use.

The FDA issued an emergency authorization in March for the Abbott ID NOW point-of-care test, which delivers results in minutes. The FDA published a warning about it on Thursday after an NYU Langone Health study, which has not been peer-reviewed, found that it might return false negatives — meaning it might say a person doesn't have the virus when they actually do.

""What we're saying is that there are some data to suggest that there may be inaccuracies, false negatives, with the Abbott test. However, there are many users who have contacted us and have not had this problem, so FDA is digging into it, and we're working with Abbott to actually look at what data are available to get the most up to date and accurate information about the test performance,"" Hahn said on ""CBS This Morning"" Friday. ""That being said, the test is on the market. We continue to recommend its use or to have it available for use.""

Hahn also noted that point-of-care tests in general ""would have a lower sensitivity than a test that's based in the laboratory.""

""We've known that for years,"" he said, but added that the data the FDA used to grant the emergency use authorization for the Abbott test ""were very robust.""

The purpose of the new FDA warning was to make sure providers have the information about what the test does.

""So for example, if a person you suspect — a doctor suspects a person has the disease, it might be worth, if the test is negative, getting a second confirmatory test. That's what our guidance is about,"" he said.

Hahn said the FDA is providing guidance to the White House about the test, but said it is up to them if they choose to keep using it. Mr. Trump has praised the test as ""ultra-fast"" and ""very accurate.""

Abbott said while some studies have shown the ""sensitivity performance percentages,"" or true positive rates, of the test to be in the 80s, others have shown it at or above 90%, and one showed it as high as 94%.

""We're seeing studies being conducted to understand the role of ID NOW in ways that it was not designed to be used. In particular, the NYU study results are not consistent with other studies,"" the statement said. ""While we understand no test is perfect, test outcomes depend on a number of factors including patient selection, specimen type, collection, handling, storage, transport and conformity to the way the test was designed to be run. ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method.""

The company also said it will clarify its guidelines and continue ""to optimize"" the test.

Hahn also was asked about the testing capacity in the United States.

""We continue to work with close to 300 test developers. We have not taken our foot off the pedal with respect to this,"" he said. ""We recognize the need to get more tests on the market, and we're working with developers to do that.""

He said there are a number of factors contributing to delays in more tests, including the need for data before authorizing a test and an ""unprecedented demand for the tests.""

Hahn would not say if putting the onus on states to run testing and contact tracing was the best approach, but said, ""there are unique circumstances in the states.""

""The governors understand what best happens in the states, and we will provide them as much support as we possibly can to make the absolute best public health decisions,"" he said.",100,High,Left-center

Dozens of hotels and sports stadiums are being constructed, along with a world-class transportation infrastructure that includes a 47-mile metro system and miles of brand new roads. Most of these massive projects were scheduled to be finished in time for the 2022 Football World Cup, which Qatar was controversially awarded to host.

Qatar sits on one of the world's biggest natural gas reserves, so securing financing for the projects was never an issue. The biggest challenge was acquiring the manpower to build and oversee all the work. Like most of its neighbors, Qatar is heavily dependent on foreign labor, mainly workers from Asian and East African countries.

Diplomatic disputes will not stop plans for 2022 FIFA World Cup

Less than 10% of Qatar's nearly 2.5 million inhabitants are Qatari nationals. About 600,000 blue-collar workers, mostly young, single non-Qatari men, labor away to build Qatar's legacy.

In color-coded uniforms, the workers are bussed onto the construction sites in the morning. In the afternoon the laborers are delivered back to huge camps, built specifically to house them, on the outskirts of the capital, Doha.

The labor camps have long been criticized by human rights groups for overcrowding and poor living conditions. Now, according to a health expert with the World Bank, due to those conditions, ""this is fertile ground for transmission of COVID-19.""

""The increase was relatively slow in the first few weeks. Then it started to rise almost exponentially from one week to another,"" Dr. Sameh El-Saharty, Lead Health Specialist at The World Bank, said recently at the Brookings Doha Center. ""These transmissions were mainly among migrant workers, and for obvious reasons.""

Since Qatar's first few cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in March, the numbers have mushroomed to almost 29,000 in less than two months. The cases have spread across all of Qatar's population, and while officials don't give precise breakdowns of where they are, it's clear many are inside the labor camps.

Authorities moved fast to contain the spreading virus by locking down the country and isolating the entire industrial area where the laborers live.

An official from the Qatari Government Communications Office told CBS News the country has, ""implemented wide-ranging containment and prevention measures [and] curtailed all social activity, closed parks and recreation facilities, shuttered mosques and other religious places of worship, and closed shops and restaurants.""

From Sunday, it will also be mandatory for everyone in Qatar to wear face coverings when out in public - enforced by a possible fine up to $53,000.

More than 11,000 hospital beds were set aside for COVID-19 patients and over 30 hotels blocked off by the government to use as quarantine facilities.

""Qatar's priority is the health, safety, and wellbeing of our population,"" the official told CBS News, adding that, ""anyone who tests positive for coronavirus immediately receives high-quality medical treatment at no cost.""

The robust health care system, and the fact that such a high proportion of the people in Qatar are young, relatively healthy laborers to begin with, has likely helped keep the confirmed COVID-19 death toll down to only 14 - considerably lower than other countries with similar case numbers.

The government is also trying to keep Qatar's economy healthy. It's providing ""financial support to businesses through an $824 million fund, so that salaries continue to be paid on time.""

The International Monetary Fund has forecasted that Qatar will be one of the few countries in the world to escape a recession in 2020.

Though the GCO official insisted that Qatar, ""is well-equipped to weather the economic impact of COVID-19,"" some major sectors will inevitably take a hit.

Qatar Airways announced this week that it will cut nearly 9,000 jobs as the coronavirus crisis keeps demand for air travel low. The airline's CEO told the BBC in an interview: ""It's a very hard decision… but we have no alternative.""

Work on Qatar's infrastructure projects, meanwhile, continues - but at a much slower pace with many projects frozen. That means many of the foreign laborers are left to bide their time - on the ""fertile ground"" of the camps.",100,High,Left-center

Now, doctors believe there's growing evidence that a rare, mysterious illness appearing in children may be linked to the virus.

It's been dubbed Pediatric Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome, abbreviated as PMIS or PIMS. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory to doctors about it Thursday afternoon, referring to the condition as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) Associated with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

Symptoms of the syndrome have been compared to those of Kawasaki disease and toxic-shock syndrome. PMIS, however, is being recognized as a ""new entity,"" according to Dr. Luiza Petre, a cardiologist and professor of cardiology at Mount Sinai's School of Medicine in New York.

Kawasaki disease is a rare but serious illness believed to be triggered by the immune system's response to infection, but an official cause is unknown.

Children with Kawasaki experience a prolonged fever lasting several days, a skin rash and swollen lymph nodes in the neck; affected children can also develop redness in their eyes, lips, mouth, as well as the palms of their hands and soles of their feet, according to the National Institutes of Health. Most children recover, but if left untreated, Kawasaki can cause cardiac issues and become life-threatening. Toxic shock also causes fever and a decrease in blood flow, but is triggered by a bacterial infection.

Kawasaki disease mostly occurs in children under the age of 5, while a study of PMIS cases in Italy found an average age of 7½.

While an understanding of PMIS is still evolving, children with the syndrome also experience a prolonged fever, rashes, change in the color of their skin or their lips, swollen glands and red eyes. What differentiates PMIS from Kawasaki appears to be complaints of abdominal pain, as well as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and chest pain.

""What we're seeing is the immune system is actually going into overdrive, impacting the body in a negative way,"" Dr. Jake Kleinmahon, a pediatric oncologist at Ochsner Hospital for Children, in New Orleans, who has treated several children for the illness, told CBS News. ""Some of these patients are having inflammation of their coronary arteries, and you can have basically a heart attack.""

According to Dr. Sean O'Leary, vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, the level of inflammation in the heart tends to be higher with PMIS, as compared to Kawasaki disease.

All together, the syndrome has shown to be more severe than Kawasaki. ""That's what's concerning,"" Petre told CBSN. ""And a lot of (PMIS) cases do require ICU, almost 80% of them.""

PMIS has been reported in over 100 children in New York, the epicenter of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak. CBS News has tallied about 200 cases under investigation in 19 states and Washington, D.C., and cases have also been reported in at least six other countries.

Doctors in Italy published a study Wednesday documenting numerous cases of PMIS linked to the coronavirus. Eight out of 10 children they studied with PMIS had antibodies to COVID-19, indicating that they had been infected.

The fact that the syndrome is appearing in places where coronavirus is prevalent suggests that there could be a correlation, O'Leary said. He cautioned, however, that it's still too early to say anything for certain: ""Some of the things I tell you will be true tomorrow, but some of them may not,"" he said.

CBS News senior medical correspondent Dr. Tara Narula said, ""It's important to stress that in the grand scheme of the pandemic, this is rare. We're still learning a lot more about it.""

New clues in mysterious illness potentially linked to COVID-19 in children

A majority of the children with PMIS symptoms reported in New York have also tested positive for COVID-19, but others have not. ""That is something we doctors don't have an explanation for,"" Petre said.

""If we talk about the frequency of Kawasaki disease, even the specialists in this disease say they've never seen more than five cases at once in one hospital,"" she said. ""So that's something definitely suspicious about the timing between COVID and these cases.""

According to O'Leary, PMIS cases seem to appear about a month after a peak of COVID-19 cases in an area. If the syndrome is brought on by a COVID-19 infection, the lag time for PMIS symptoms is a curious feature, he said. ""It's almost more surprising that most of these kids are (COVID-19) positive.""

""That's the mystery, it's a lot like a delayed reaction,"" Petre said of the symptoms' onset.

If a child does present with PMIS symptoms, it is important to contact your doctor. According to Petre, if a child has a fever that doesn't go down and is resistant to medication for more than a day, a doctor should be contacted.

The American Academy of Pediatrics released guidelines for parents earlier this week advising them to call their pediatrician if they notice any of the following symptoms:

a fever that won't go away

abdominal pain, diarrhea or vomiting

rash or changes in skin color

trouble breathing

your child seems confused or overly sleepy

""In this syndrome early intervention is critical as children can decompensate very quickly, and they should seek medical attention immediately,"" Petre said.

According to Petre and O'Leary, if a child is admitted for PMIS, their primary treatment will be supportive care. Fluids and medication would likely be administered to maintain blood pressure, as well as anti-inflammatory medication like steroids or immunoglobulin (IVIG).

""If you're not really aware of this syndrome that's being described, it could easily be missed,"" said Kleinmahon. ""Fortunately children overall are very resilient. And almost all of the cases, if we're able to knock down the inflammation and get them past the beginning stages of this, they're usually doing very well.""",100,High,Left-center

""Rapid response Northwest 6. Rapid response Northwest 6. Blue zone.""

Dr. Michelle Ng Gong oversees a rapid response team of critical care doctors responding to a crashing COVID-19 patient. Gilad Thaler

Dr. Michelle Ng Gong strapped on a face shield as the sound of the Montefiore Medical Center PA system broadcasted an all-too-familiar announcement: a COVID-19 patient was in critical condition. Gong rushed out of the command center, weaved through the hallways, and dodged stretchers as she made her way toward the patient's room.

Before entering the room, Gong called for gowns, grabbed several herself and handed them out to other nurses who had just arrived. Gong was about to enter the ""red zone,"" an area where personal protective gear, or PPE, would be the only barrier between her and the virus.

The patient was on a ventilator, but his oxygen levels had fallen. Gong didn't believe he was moving his chest wall well. She wanted to attempt taking the ventilator out of the equation and manually deliver oxygen. She reached for the patient's foot.

""He's got good blood pressure, he's got a good pulse."" Gong leaped onto the patient's chest — her feet dangled in the air, her face mere inches from the patient's, as she exerted her own body weight. Gong wanted to see if the patient could stand being placed in a ""prone position"" — a process that requires several healthcare workers to rotate the patient onto the patient's stomach to help get oxygen to the back of the lungs.

Gong determined that the patient would benefit from this process, but he would first need to be transmitted to the Surgical ICU.

In normal times, gowns are discarded each time a nurse or doctor interacts with a patient to minimize contamination in ""green zones"" of the hospital. But this patient needed to get to the surgical ICU immediately.

""Please clear all corridors,"" a voice said over the PA system.

Because he had just been removed from a ventilator, there was a greater chance he would spread COVID-19 into the air. A doctor placed a translucent sheet of plastic over the patient's face, a technique used to minimize spreading the virus, and a team of four remained clad in full PPE while they wheeled the patient across multiple hallways and down an elevator bank.

While hospitalizations have gone down across New York, the patients who have been admitted are getting sicker.

Said Gong: ""These are still not normal times, and these are still very sick patients."" Despite her best efforts, this patient died later that night.

Nurse Jasmine Christakos says she will always remember the first COVID-19 death in the Surgical ICU. Christakos had just gotten married in late February and returned to work as the virus was beginning to spread rapidly.

Christakos recalled a family grieving over the fact that they could not visit, and that the patient would die alone. Christakos remembers that night, when the entire unit sat in front of the patient's room and waited for the ventilator to be pulled. ""We said a prayer, we said goodbye, and we told the family, no, they didn't die alone. They died with us.""

Many of the patients admitted to the Surgical ICU make it out. When a patient is well enough to breathe on their own, they are ""extubated,"" or removed from a ventilator, offering cause for celebration from doctors and nurses.

""Since COVID, it's been a little difficult to find the light in the darkness. But you celebrate the little victories,"" Christakos told CBS News.

While witnessing the extubation of one patient, Doctor Jen-Ting (Tina) Chen called for a nurse to ring a cowbell, signaling the good news to the rest of the floor. After an extubation a few days earlier on the same floor, a nurse wrote the time on a white-board, and drew a heart.

At the peak of the pandemic, Montefiore Hospital Center broadcasted ""Empire State of Mind"" by Alicia Keys over the PA system and Christakos has taken to dancing during the ""happy code.""

""It's an amazing experience to see someone no longer need a breathing tube. No longer need the help of a ventilator,"" Christakos said. ""I've seen patients where I was like, 'Oh my goodness are they going to make it?' And they do."" To Christakos, it is victories like these that make the work, ""so worth it, just absolutely worth it.""

By mid-April, the coronavirus had killed more people in New York than anywhere else, and of the city's five boroughs, the Bronx was the hardest hit. Very few journalists had spent time in hospitals on the front lines, and I had just signed up for seven days and nights inside a COVID-stricken hospital to document what the health care workers on the front lines were experiencing.

I was not just making a decision about putting my own health at risk. I was making a decision for my wife and two young children, too. My wife and I talked it through. A lot. And she saw it clearly: ""This is your job. To go and tell their stories, accepting the risk just like they do.""

""Bodies keep piling up""

Chris Feliciano, a paramedic in New York City. Andrew Bast

Before dawn on Day 2, I drove out to Fort Totten in Queens where EMS crews of the New York City Fire Department assemble first thing in the morning, preparing to fan out across the city and respond to emergency calls. That's where I met Chris Feliciano, a paramedic who had recovered from coronavirus himself and was now back to work.

""This is worse than 9/11,"" Feliciano told me. ""I say that because 9/11 was just one day and unfortunately over 3,000 people died in that one day but we're seeing numbers well above that and this is continuous. This is not just one day, this is daily and the bodies keep piling up.""

The calls never stopped. Within 10 minutes of treating one patient the ambulance lights would flash, the siren would blare, and we would be racing again through the streets of the Bronx.

Shortness of breath was the most common symptom from patients. They were scared and said as much. And they faced a grim reality: going to the hospital could be more dangerous than trying to recover at home.

""Because the hospitals are so overwhelmed, it's a mass casualty incident at the moment with the city,"" Feliciano said. ""We would generally get cardiac arrests about once or twice a week. But now it's just happening at all hours of the day.""

At a small row house later that morning, we arrived too late for the elderly man inside. He was pronounced ""D.O.A.""—dead on arrival.

The volume of calls forced FDNY to put a new protocol in place. ""We will try for 20 minutes to resuscitate a patient,"" Feliciano said. ""If there's no response to our interventions, we would have to pronounce on scene.""

""Like a buffalo on my chest""

Cristian Camas Gilad Thaler

Overwhelmed with patients, Montefiore Medical Center, the largest hospital in the Bronx, transformed a giant meeting hall into a COVID-19 ward. The moment I walked in for the first time, a young doctor said to me, ""There's a 22-year-old ambulance worker here, you should talk with him.""

In one of the dozens of makeshift rooms, I pulled back the curtain and found Cristian Camas. He lay on his hospital bed, working hard to breathe. A rosary hung on the bedside railing. Sweat beaded down his forehead. ""It was like a buffalo was on my chest,"" he kept saying, describing how the disease had overcome him. Telling his story, he echoed a haunting refrain he repeated again and again: ""I didn't think I was going to make it.""

Camas worked for a private ambulance company and likely contracted the virus while helping to save the lives of others.

We FaceTimed with Cristian's father who lived in the South Bronx. Despite everything that was happening, he invited me to their home.

Cristian's mother explained that an uncle had recently died. Cristian's 13-year-old brother Erik was worried about the rest of the family.

""There was a moment here where I was by myself, because my mom, she started feeling sick, too,"" said Erik, Cristian's 13-year-old brother. ""I imagine myself without any of them, and I knew that I couldn't do anything without them. It was horrible.""

Before a table bearing a bible and a candle, Erik led the family in prayer, asking God for Cristian to come home safely.

Three days later, his prayers were answered. Cristian was one of the 314 patients discharged from the hospital over the week we were there.

One more night shift

Dr. Michelle Gong Gilad Thaler

The last night of shooting was a Wednesday near the end of April. It was chilly and clear out. I went into the hospital to follow Dr. Michelle Gong, chief of critical care, for one more night shift.

I geared up—full-body Tyvek suit, surgical gloves, N95 covered with a surgical mask, full-face plastic shield—and it took less than 10 minutes for a ""code"" to come. It was an urgent call for rapid response to a patient in distress.

A team of doctors swarmed a crashing patient, more human bodies in a single patient's room than I imagined was possible. Nurses scrambled for supplies, wrappers and plastic gloves flipped into the air, left scattered on the hospital floor like emergency detritus. I sweat through my PPE as I shot video of Dr. Gong as she climbed onto the bed so she could push down on the patient's chest, a procedure to determine if his body could handle being turned over. They got the patient to the ICU.

What fear looks like

Andrew Bast Gilad Thaler

In the week we spent at the hospital, COVID took the lives of 70 people.

For seven days, I'd been pointing a camera at countless medical professionals as they raced to save lives, strained to protect themselves from the virus. As they laughed and celebrated small victories, as they broke down and wept over endless death that had overwhelmed their lives.

What I didn't know was that, for just a moment, a colleague snapped a photo of me at work. In all my time at Montefiore, I never thought I felt afraid.

Then I saw the image. It's undeniable what filled my eyes: a new kind of fear.

As the first major sports league in the world to return during the coronavirus pandemic, some hope it could provide a roadmap for the U.S.' major leagues – the NFL, NBA, MLB and others.

""Every little thing about what Germany has done should be watched very closely by U.S. sports,"" Grant Wahl, a leading soccer journalist and author of ""Masters of Modern Soccer,"" told CBS News' Roxana Saberi.

Many Bundesliga teams resumed training in April after regular games were sidelined in March over COVID-19 and players were sent into quarantine.

One team, Dynamo Dresden, has already had to delay its start after two players tested positive for the virus and forced the entire team into a 14-day lockdown.

The return to the pitch will have some noticeable changes, starting with teams' entrances. A single team will have to ride in on multiple busses to observe social distancing rules.

At games, coaches and substitutes not in play will have to wear face masks.

Players on the field have been told they can make physical contact as part of the game, but the hugging and celebratory embraces that come with scoring a goal are no longer allowed.

""We have to think about this, what we could do, because sometimes automatically you go to your teammate to celebrate the goal,"" Robert Lewandowski, striker for Bundesliga's Bayern Munich team, said.

The stands will also be noticeably quiet, with live fans banned for the rest of the season. Some will be paying to have cardboard cutouts of themselves sitting in stadiums instead.

""We of course will miss spectators, and therefore of course it's important, but it's not the time for wishes and dreams,"" said Carsten Cramer, managing director of the team Borussia Dortmund.

Although soccer fans may be excited, opinions in Germany are split. As the country eases its strict pandemic lockdown, a recent poll suggests just over half of respondents oppose the return of soccer matches.",100,High,Left-center

The bill is known as the HEROES Act, the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act.

The measure, over 1,800 pages long, is unlikely to gain any traction in the Republican-controlled Senate, although Senate Leader Mitch McConnell has indicated the Senate will pass further COVID-19 relief legislation. But he said he will work with the White House to determine what's needed and how soon.

McConnell has backed off an earlier statement that states should be allowed to go bankrupt, conceding that there will have to be another relief bill at some point. However, he said his red line is the inclusion of liability-protection provisions for businesses to keep them from being sued if workers or patrons are infected with COVID-19.

The House bill will now go the Senate, where Republican senators have already indicated the bill is dead on arrival.

Earlier Friday evening, the House also passed a measure to temporarily allow both remote voting by proxy and official remote committee proceedings during the coronavirus pandemic. The nearly party-line vote, 217 to 189, means that a member present at the Capitol would be able to cast a vote on behalf of up to 10 absent colleagues.

The pandemic has raised concerns about having lawmakers gather to vote, particularly since many members of Congress are older than 60 and therefore more vulnerable to serious illness caused by the virus.

House Republicans opposed the rule change, arguing that members of Congress are essential workers and should return to the Capitol.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said when she announced the legislation on Wednesday that the plan was ""necessary to address the corona crisis,"" arguing that the bill's priorities were ""opening our economy safely and soon, honoring our heroes, and then putting much needed money in the pockets of Americans.""

The House votes came as the unemployment rate rises to levels unseen since the Great Depression, with millions of Americans out of work or furloughed.

The bill includes provisions to assist farmers, protect renters and homeowners from evictions and foreclosures, and extend family and medical leave provisions previously approved by Congress. The legislation would also provide relief for essential workers, such as aviation, rail and Amtrak workers, as well as extend work visas for immigrants.

It faced opposition from Republicans and more moderate Democrats in the House because of its size, although progressives argue the legislation doesn't go far enough. Democratic Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal, known for her progressive politics, told reporters Friday that she would not support the bill.

""I, unfortunately, will be voting no on the bill, and really, this was a difficult decision for me,"" Jayapal said, explaining that the bill did not do enough to ensure paycheck guarantees for struggling workers.

Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a prominent progressive freshman in the House, told reporters that it was a ""tough bill.""

""I think we can go further, especially when it comes to healthcare,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, calling the bill a ""mixed bag.""

Meanwhile, Republicans argued that the bill was far too large. Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, a Republican from North Carolina, said on the House floor Friday that it was a ""dark day for our country."" Republican Congressman Tom Cole called the legislation ""massive and unwarranted.""

""I'm just mystified why my friends felt the need to inject a clearly partisan bill and think this is going to move us down the road in the right direction. It's not,"" Cole said on the House floor.

In his weekly press conference, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy appealed to the 40 freshman Democrats who flipped Republican seats in 2018, urging them to vote against the bill.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell previously said it was time to hit ""pause"" on negotiating the next round of coronavirus legislation.

""The president and Senate Republicans are going to be in the same place,"" he said in an interview on Fox News on Thursday. ""We will let you know when we think the time is right to begin to move again. I think there's a high likelihood we'll do another bill, and I've just indicated what we'll need to be a part of any bill that actually gets a presidential signature and is brought up and passed by a Republican majority in the Senate.""

Bright filed a whistleblower complaint charging the Trump administration with failing to heed his calls for preparation and then ending his role as head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. He speaks to Norah O'Donnell in his first interview since his removal from BARDA for a 60 Minutes report to be broadcast this Sunday.

In an excerpt from the interview that appeared on the CBS Evening News, O'Donnell notes that Bright says in his complaint that HHS Secretary Alex Azar was intent on downplaying the catastrophic threat.

""Why would he do that?"" O'Donnell asked Bright.

""You know, I don't know why he would do that,"" Bright said.

President Trump was also downplaying the threat. He said at an event in Michigan on January 30, ""We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment.""

""Remember, the entire leadership was focused on containment,"" Bright told O'Donnell. ""There was a belief that we could contain this virus and keep it out of the United States. Containment doesn't work. Containment does buy time. It could slow. It very well could slow the spread. But while you're slowing the spread, you better be doing something in parallel to be prepared for when that virus breaks out. That was my job.""

The Department of Health and Human Services has said that it strongly disagrees with the claims in Bright's complaint and Secretary Azar said, ""his allegations do not hold water.""

""Our window of opportunity is closing. If we fail to develop a national coordinated response, based in science, I fear the pandemic will get far worse and be prolonged, causing unprecedented illness and fatalities,"" Bright told a House subcommittee Thursday morning. ""Without better planning, 2020 could be the darkest winter in modern history.""

Bright, who remains a federal employee, testified Thursday before the Subcommittee on Health for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce about the pandemic and the whistleblower complaint he filed about being removed from his job as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Bright claims that he was ousted from his position after raising concerns about a coronavirus treatment supported by President Trump.

In his prepared testimony, Bright said he believes his transfer came about as a result of his insistence that money allocated by Congress to confront COVID-19 should be put ""into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit.""

""I spoke out then and I am testifying today because science — not politics or cronyism — must lead the way to combat this deadly virus,"" Bright said.

He also advocated ""clear leadership, honest communication, and data-driven solutions"" as the pandemic continues, and suggested increasing public education on health measures such as hand-washing and social distancing, as well as ramping up production of essential equipment and implementing a national testing system.

Whistleblower says Trump administration ignored warnings about coronavirus

Bright's whistleblower complaint, filed earlier this month, said he was removed as director of BARDA soon after the publication of an article about chloroquine for which Bright admits he was a source.

Government officials, he said in his complaint, ""refused to listen,"" so Bright opted to talk to a journalist. He said he believed that he had a moral obligation to do what he could to protect the public ""from drugs which he believed constituted a substantial and specific danger to public health and safety.""

The Department of Health and Human Services issued a lengthy statement attempting to rebut Bright's testimony in the form of a fact check.

The federal Office of Special Counsel last week determined his removal was retaliatory and said that Bright should be reinstated as director of BARDA while the matter is investigated.

Mr. Trump has referred to hydroxychloroquine as a potential ""game-changer"" in treating COVID-19 and has recommended the use of the antimalarial drug as a potential treatment, despite limited evidence of the drug's efficacy.

In mid-April, the Trump administration granted chloroquine an Emergency Use Authorization, an FDA authority that allows unapproved medical products to be used in medical emergencies. The FDA on April 24 cautioned against the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine ""outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial.""

Bright claims his persistent warnings caused tension with his bosses at the Department of Health and Human Services. He says it reached a breaking point when he raised concerns over the administration's embrace of hydroxychloroquine, what Bright called a drug unproven to treat COVID-19 patients.

""You believe you were retaliated against because you raised concerns about hydroxychloroquine?"" CBS News' Norah O'Donnell asked Bright in a ""60 Minutes"" interview that will air May 17.

""Yes. I do,"" Bright replied.

Mr. Trump has said he doesn't know Bright, but he ""seems like a disgruntled employee who's trying to help the Democrats win an election.""

""I am not disgruntled,"" Bright told ""60 Minutes."" ""I am frustrated at a lack of leadership. I am frustrated at a lack of urgency to get a head start on developing life-saving tools for Americans. I'm frustrated at our inability to be heard as scientists.""

And he says he was surprised to learn he'd been reassigned to the NIH to develop diagnostic testing.

""I'm the director of BARDA,"" Bright told O'Donnell. ""To take me out of our organization focused on drugs and vaccines and diagnostics in the middle of a pandemic, of the worst public health crisis that our country's faced in a century, and decapitate the BARDA organization. To move me over to a very small focused project of any scale, of any level importance is not responsible. Didn't make sense.""

The Obama administration had in fact prepared a 69-page playbook for pandemic response — which the Trump administration appeared to not follow.

""I was wrong,"" McConnell said in an interview with Fox News' Bret Baier. ""They did leave behind a plan. So, I clearly made a mistake in that regard.""

McConnell also said he didn't know whether the Trump administration was following the guidance prepared by the president's predecessor.

""As to whether or not the plan was followed and who is the critic and all the rest, I don't have any observation about that because I don't know enough about the details of that, Bret, to comment on it in any detail,"" the Kentucky Republican said.

At a virtual campaign event for Mr. Trump on Monday, McConnell blamed the Obama administration for not taking steps to be ready for a potential pandemic.

""We want to be early, ready for the next one, because clearly the Obama administration did not leave to this administration any kind of game plan for something like this,"" McConnell told Lara Trump, the president's daughter-in-law. ""

McConnell also said it was ""classless"" for Obama to criticize Mr. Trump's handling of the crisis, and said the former president ""should have kept his mouth shut."" Mr. Obama said in a private call to supporters last week that the Trump administration's response has been ""an absolute chaotic disaster.""

""You had your shot. You were there for eight years,"" McConnell said. ""I think the tradition that the Bushes set up — of not critiquing the president who comes after you — is a good tradition.""

The Obama administration did in fact pass along a comprehensive pandemic plan, including a 69-page playbook for an early response to infectious diseases. Politico reported on the playbook in March and noted that the Trump administration lagged or did not follow through on many of its steps.

The playbook included recommendations for a ""unified message"" from a ""single federal spokesperson,"" and for invoking the Defense Production Act, which Mr. Trump hesitated to use in the early weeks of the pandemic.

Mr. Trump also disbanded the National Security Council's pandemic response unit and sought funding cuts for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before the coronavirus landed in the United States.

But now, there's encouraging news about a potential vaccine that's now being tested on humans and monkeys.

NIH researchers in Montana tested the vaccine using six rhesus macaque monkeys. They said the monkeys that got the vaccine developed protective antibodies against the coronavirus.

But it's what happened next that's giving doctors hope. When they exposed the animals to coronavirus, the monkeys that weren't vaccinated developed pneumonia, a sign of COVID-19. But those that got the vaccine, and developed the protective antibodies, had no pneumonia and no virus in their lungs.

""Why isn't it enough to show that a vaccine elicits, say, an antibody response?"" asked CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook.

""We need to know that it protects the animal or the human from the infection,"" said Dr. Kathryn Edwards, who directs vaccine research at Vanderbilt University. ""And just having the antibody, if it doesn't work to prevent disease, it's not going to cut it.""

The vaccine used in the study is being developed by Oxford University. It relies on a cold virus that's been modified so it can't spread infection. The vaccine is packed with genetic material from the coronavirus — and once injected, it triggers an immune response, teaching the body to recognize and fight a future infection.

Oxford professor of human genetics Adrian Hill said that if it works, it has another important benefit. ""This is not a hugely difficult vaccine to make,"" he said. ""So large scale is feasible, we believe.""

With a history of asthma, the 26-year-old Denver resident was familiar with respiratory distress, but this was different.

Both the ER doctors and Thomas suspected COVID-19. Yet while Thomas was experiencing symptoms of the disease, including severe pain in her lungs, she didn't receive a test for the virus. The reason: Thomas was never officially admitted to the hospital, so she didn't qualify for one of the sought-after tests, which the hospital at the time was limiting to patients who had been admitted. Instead, Thomas was stabilized by ER staff and sent home to recover with a fistful of prescriptions.

Weeks later, Thomas is feeling much better, but is now dealing with a new problem — sorting through the bills from her ER visit to determine what she owes. The financial hit from her COVID-19 treatment is part of the impact of the coronavirus, which has not only infected about 1.4 million Americans but also left many with heavy medical bills.

And plenty of stress — it's often unclear who is on the hook for paying for coronavirus treatments. That's especially true for patients like Thomas, who weren't able to get tested for the disease when they initially sought medical care.

""I'm still sorting through everything and trying to figure out what might be covered under new COVID rules and how it's all going to work out,"" she said. ""This ER bill is pretty huge.""

Thomas said she got a ""not very well itemized"" statement from her in-network hospital, which shows about $1,200 in coinsurance charges for her ER treatment. Co-pays from prescriptions add another $200 to her costs. She expects she'll also owe a $500 co-payment for any ER visits, although she hasn't yet found the bill for that. And she wonders if she'll be on the hook for two telehealth follow-up doctor visits.

Treatment costs could top $20,000

Exactly what's covered by insurance for COVID-19 patients with out-of-pocket health care costs is a mystery to plenty of patients like Thomas. The patchwork of initiatives from the government and health insurance industry may create as much confusion as relief for consumers.

""I wish there were a federal law that said it was illegal to give a bill to a patient during all this,"" said Karen Pollitz, senior fellow at Kaiser Family Foundation. ""But it all depends on who is taking care of you.""

Costs for patients hospitalized for COVID-19 may reach $20,000 per person, while individuals can expect to pay an average of at least $1,300 in out-of-pocket costs, according to a Kaiser analysis. Even patients who aren't hospitalized may still face pricey medical bills for outpatient treatments, testing and ER visits that don't end in hospital admission, health advocates said.

Fear of racking up heavy medical bills may be keeping at least some people from seeking COVID-19 treatment. About one in seven adults said they would avoid seeking medical care for a fever and dry cough due to concerns about costs, according to a recent study from Gallup and West Health.

""Broken"" system

Dozens of insurers, including Aetna, Cigna and Humana have waived some combination of co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles for COVID-19 treatments including hospital stays, according to America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group. But these waivers vary in what they cover, and not all people with insurance may be eligible.

In many cases, these waivers apply to treatment from out-of-network providers — an important consideration for patients in hard-hit areas where it may be impossible to limit your options to in-network care. Bills for out-of-network services are often the cause of surprise medical expenses.

Before the outbreak, several members of Congress were working on ways to eliminate surprise billing. Now, several patient advocate groups are encouraging lawmakers to deal with the issue for all patients in the next stimulus bill.

The pandemic ""shines a bright light on just how broken our health system is,"" said Emily Holubowich, vice president of federal advocacy for the American Heart Association. Patients with heart disease are at much higher risk for serious complications from COVID-19 and, in turn, expensive medical bills.

Dr. Agus addresses concerns about U.S. reopening too soon amid coronavirus crisis

Some waivers took effect in late March while others start April 1. Some have waived cost-sharing for virtual doctor appointments by video or phone, yet other plans still require patients to meet their deductible before covering those consultations. Insurers also have varying definitions of what COVID-19 treatment actually means. (To find out your insurer's rules check this list or call directly.)

Pollitz of the Kaiser Family Foundation notes another important caveat: Even if you think you have insurance from one of the companies offering cost-sharing waivers, you may not be eligible. That's because most employer-sponsored plans are self-funded and set their own rules about coverage. Insurers simply administer the plans.

""You may be carrying a Blue Cross Blue Shield card in your pocket, but if your employer decides not to pay, you'll get hit,"" Pollitz said.

On the hook?

Thomas said she worries she'll be on the hook for the full amount of her cost-sharing for the treatment she received. That's because she visited the ER on March 24 and her insurer is waiving out-of-pocket costs only for COVID-19 treatments that began on April 1. She also expressed concern that, because she was never tested, she can't prove she was treated for COVID-19 even if it is possible to negotiate an exception on the date with her insurer.

Patient advocates say stories like Thomas's are just the beginning of what promises to be a flood of questions, complaints and appeals concerning COVID-19 coverage.

""It takes weeks for medical bills to show up, especially from out-of-network providers,"" explained Adam Fox, director of strategic engagement at the Colorado Consumer Health Initiative.

With COVID-19, meanwhile, it may take even longer as hospitals wait to see how much they will receive from existing and future government stimulus packages and how much of that will be used for compensating out-of-network providers, Fox predicted.

Follow the bouncing bill

Under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, passed in late March, hospitals that receive emergency funding are prohibited from billing patients for fees beyond their network reimbursement rate.

""But that will be difficult for patients to track,"" Pollitz predicted.

The Trump administration has mandated that all comprehensive health insurance plans must pay for 100% of the cost of coronavirus testing as well as the visit to the ER, doctor's office or urgent care center that may have led to that testing. Definitive as that sounds, however, there are gray areas.

Take 25-year-old Anna Davis Abel of Morgantown, West Virginia, who has lupus, an immune disease that may make her more susceptible to coronavirus complications. Tests for COVID-19 were scarce when she came down with similar symptoms in early March. Her doctor decided to first rule out other respiratory illnesses, testing her for the flu and other common viruses.

The tests found that Davis Abel in fact had the flu. During her recovery, she received a co-insurance bill for more than $500 for the test and the doctor visit. Davis Abel and her doctor both believe the test should be covered completely as a cost related to COVID-19 testing, an argument the doctor made in writing.

This interview has been edited for clarity and length.

As we look for sensible ways to jump-start the battered U.S. economy, which industries should reopen first, and which would you reopen last?

Dr. Tom Frieden: Things that can open first include lower-risk physical businesses like restaurants doing takeout and outdoor recreation. Day care, as well, is enormously important economically, and may be able to reopen relatively soon in this process as long as you keep vulnerable staff and children out and make it clear that children and staff participating could potentially be exposed.

The places that are hardest are places where lots of people are indoors and there is limited space, or where there is lots of travel. Bars, the tourism industry, conventions, conferences, some cultural events, some indoor sporting events are going to be really tough. There may be a way for sporting events with few or no in-person spectators and cultural events with masks on the audience, hand sanitizer and potentially other safety and sanitary features to get back to a newer reality, but it isn't going to be easy.

We have to be careful about things that can backfire if we end up coming out too soon and that result in the substantial spread of the virus. That will be counterproductive to the reopening of the economy.

How will workplaces need to adapt? What will the office of the future look like, for instance?

I do think that, until we have either a vaccine or a highly effective treatment, the workplace will be different. We are going to have to reimagine the workplace and its design for the new reality. That will mean less travel, more telework and fewer meetings. When we do go back to our offices, there will be mandatory hand sanitizer as we enter, no common snack rooms. We'll be physically distancing, even at work, for the foreseeable future.

We will be physically distancing in meetings, and we will avoid communal gatherings. We'll be ensuring people don't come to work sick. De-densifying will be a big part of it — also splitting schedules, days, hours and travel, which defeats the purpose of having people together in one space. But it's a way of starting that limits the risk.

Do you expect many of these changes to be permanent, or only temporary until the virus is under control?

I predict we will see permanent work-from-home options. A lot of people will realize they don't need to rent expensive office space when people can work from home with a similar level of efficiency. I do think more telework and less travel are here to stay for a while. I also think we are inevitably going to see more travel restrictions, and potentially 14-day quarantines when you go to a new country. It's very old-fashioned — it goes back half a millennium or more. But if your country or state or province has gone through a tremendous effort to control the virus, you won't want to allow the unlimited travel of people who may unwittingly spread the virus in your country.

We are also going to have to better accommodate people who are vulnerable to the disease — the elderly and people with underlying health conditions. People who are particularly vulnerable will stay out longer if they can telework. If they can't, they'll need some form of disability so we can get back to work sooner without risking the health of the most vulnerable, and so they don't pay the economic price for that.

You are currently president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, a global non-profit that works to prevent death from cardiovascular disease and to stop epidemics. What kinds of changes will you make within your own workplace?

[We redid] our workplace a year ago at Resolve To Save Lives, which is housed within Vital Strategies, and it's largely open plan. There are partitions between desks, but there are lots of small meeting rooms. That's a problem as we put plans in place to reopen. We'll have to convert meeting rooms to individual offices or seal them off, because you can't have small meeting rooms where you are sitting one foot away from each other and have multiple people using the same room throughout the course of day — that's not safe. We have two conference rooms that are large enough for a small meeting with people sitting far apart from one another. We'll have to change the other conference rooms to offices.

Ex-CDC director outlines four key measures to ""go back to new normal""

What are the risks — to public health in the U.S. and to the economy — of reopening too quickly?

We are all anxious to get back out into the new normal, and there are some activities we can do with little-to-no risk. Outdoor activities, for example, are far less risky than indoor activities. But the risk is that if we reopen too soon, we will rekindle infections. It won't be a question of a second wave, but many waves. No one knows how the virus will behave in warm weather. There may be less risk or there may not be. But still, the vast majority of Americans are vulnerable to this virus.

We do have to balance our economy and public health measures, and what we found from around the country and around the world is that the places that implemented public health measures the best also protect their economy the best.

There is a misconception that the major economic harm is from the government orders to stay at home. That's actually not necessarily the case. People are understandably afraid that if they go out to the store, they could get an infection that kills them or a vulnerable parent. Even where physical distancing recommendations are reduced, there is a delay in people going back out. The bigger issue is that we have to come to terms with the fact that this is a bad pandemic and it's just the beginning of a long fight against it.

Many small businesses have been seriously hurt by the shutdown and are understandably eager to reopen their doors. What's your message to them?

If your customers die from an infection they get in your shop, it's not good for your business. So it's in everyone's interest to make a business as safe as possible.

This is not about public health versus the economy. In order to make the economy healthier, we need to control the virus. It's also in the interest of business people to have a strong public health system, so people who may be brewing infection are warned and quarantined and don't come into your shop, and people who are infected are identified and isolated so they don't spread it. The more we box the virus in, the more space there is for us in society.

How important a role will contact tracing play in reopening the economy?

Contact tracing will be very important. We have this blunt tool, which is sheltering in place, and that really drives down the spread of the virus. Then we have more precise but not as strong tools. One toolset is the way we design [workplaces] for the age of COVID, which includes no-touch doors, no-touch elevators and no-touch hand sanitizer. We have partitions and other design solutions to make a safer world.

Another set of inventions are precise tools that are the ""Box It In"" tools. They are to test, isolate, contact trace and quarantine — those are the four corners of our box. If any corner of that box is weak, the virus can get out and spread, but if you are in a workplace and there is a case [of COVID-19] you have to follow the exposure protocols.

How many contact tracers will we need?

If the ratio of contact tracers needed in the U.S. is the same as the number they used in Wuhan, China, it would be about 300,000 people. The exact number depends on the number of cases and the efficiency of the process — how readily people cooperate with the process.

I also think it's important to emphasize that contact tracing is not a simple job. There is a misconception that anyone can do it. It's a hard job that requires people skills, medical knowledge, resourcefulness, the ability to reach people and establish, build and maintain trust. You should also be tech-savvy to reach people and identify their contacts. It will be a major facilitator of economic recovery from the pandemic perspective.

Do you agree with the plan President Trump has set out for gradually reopening the economy, or are we being too hasty?

I think the guidelines outlined by the White House were sensible. They outlined things that are important to track in order to know we are not likely to have an explosion of cases when we reopen.

On the other hand, people are very impatient to go out, and there hasn't been a consistent and clear explanation to the public of what the reasons are for having to stay apart or having to continue to refrain from certain activities. I think that reflects messaging that hasn't been consistent and science-based. If people are impatient to go out, you hope at least when they go out, they will do so as safely as possible.",100,High,Left-center

In a briefing for reporters on Friday -- the first high-level strategy discussion with the press since Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon took over in mid-March -- senior aides insisted they believe the president's growing unpopularity will sink his chances.

""Presidents get measured by how they are seen in a crisis,"" Biden senior strategist Mike Donilon said. ""He didn't act decisively, what he did was he froze.""

""The single biggest driver in terms of turnout and enthusiasm is actually going to be the percentage of people who have very favorable, very unfavorable opinion of Donald Trump,"" Donilon added.

With the death toll from the virus at more than 80,000 Americans and unemployment creeping towards historic Depression-era levels, Donilon said the Trump administration's public health and economic response is ""not going to be a distant memory because the public has a very clear sense of what happened.""

During the Zoom session, Biden aides said they believe the November contest will focus on all or parts of 17 states. These include those states they say require ""protecting"" — the Democratic-friendly states of Virginia, Minnesota, Colorado, New Hampshire and Nevada; states they are focused on ""winning back"" — Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Iowa, North Carolina and Florida — where President Obama found success — and ""expanding"" the map to include the states of Arizona, Georgia and Texas.

Biden's team is also targeting congressional districts that have swung red and blue in varying elections in Maine and Nebraska, two states that divide up electoral college votes based on results in individual House districts.

Senior aides forecasted that if Biden can prevail in Florida, Arizona, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and hold all other states Hillary Clinton won in 2016, then Biden would capture 318 electoral votes, eclipsing the necessary 270 electoral votes to become president. Clinton lost all of these states in 2016, while Mr. Obama won all of these states, except Arizona, in 2012.

Map: Where the Biden campaign believes it is competitive.

O'Malley Dillon was especially confident about Biden's chances in Arizona.

""I am bullish about Arizona. Arizona is a battleground state for the first time,"" she said.

The Grand Canyon State has voted Republican in recent presidential elections, but the campaign said it believes it can win by driving up turnout among Latino and younger voters and by coordinating closely with Democratic Senate candidate Mark Kelly, a popular former astronaut who is polling ahead of Republican Sen. Martha McSally and topping her in fundraising.

The campaign, in its 64-minute briefing, did not specify a strategy to ""win back"" other states where Clinton lost in 2016, like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.

To turn the perceived map into reality, Donilon said Biden's initial message of fighting for the middle class and drawing a contrast between Biden and Mr. Trump on character has been amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic.

But voters eager to see Biden in real life may have to wait longer even as Mr. Trump has started traveling again to states like Arizona and Pennsylvania.

The campaign on Friday declined to offer a timeline for Biden's physical return to the campaign trail.

""There is obviously a lot of interest in, you know, his location but he is fundamentally showing up where voters are and engaging with them every single day,"" O'Malley Dillon said. ""First and foremost, the most important thing for us and for the campaign is public safety.""

She assured reporters that appropriate measures to ensure everyone's safety would be taken by Biden and the large staff and Secret Service contingent that comes with a presidential campaign. Asked whether there are plans to test Biden for COVID-19 -- as the candidate mentioned briefly earlier this week -- senior staffers said there was no current plan to test him.

O'Malley Dillon debuted plans to have more than 600 field and outreach staff in states by June. She said the campaign's bank account is growing substantially, boosted by the Democratic party's alignment behind Biden, and now has $103 million cash on hand.

Asked by a reporter if the Biden campaign believes the Trump campaign has anything to do with the expanded allegations of sexual assault from Tara Reade, deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said, ""The short answer on that is no.""

""We are not questioning her motive and [Biden] has addressed this unequivocally,"" she added. Biden denies the allegations.",100,High,Left-center

There's also no basketball

and no Olympics. America's favorite sports are on hiatus, and swaths of the nation are under stay-home orders. At least voters will be able to tune in for the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, which are still scheduled to take place in August in Milwaukee and Charlotte, respectively. (Granted — watching Donald Trump and Joe Biden accept the nominations of their respective parties is not exactly the same as watching a thunderous dunk from Greek Freak Giannis Antetokounmpo.)

Local and state leaders usually look forward to the spotlight afforded by the conventions, which typically draw thousands from around the country. But this year is different, given the COVID-related constraints. CBS News talked with community leaders, business owners, health experts and elected officials in both cities about their hopes and fears surrounding the conventions this year.

DEMOCRATS STRESS ""FLEXIBILITY""

Democrats have already begun to make concessions, announcing their convention would be postponed by a month, to August 17 because of the virus.

This week, the DNC advanced a resolution to allow delegates to attend the convention remotely and empower convention planners to make health-based decisions about the event without going through the usual lengthy approval process, a tacit acknowledgment that the convention could look different this year. Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez said this week he expects and hopes to have ""an exciting and inspiring convention in August in Milwaukee,"" but ""does this mean that a precise format has been decided? No.""

""We certainly don't want to plan an event that's going to put anyone's health at risk,"" DNCC spokesperson Katie Peters told CBS News. Peters said planners are ""building in as much flexibility"" as possible, to ""scale up or scale down as the nation continues to learn more about the direction that this health crisis is going.""

Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley says the data will dictate when officials need to make a decision about how to conduct the convention, but for now, ""I don't think that it is appropriate for us to talk about a timeline."" Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett says there remain a wide range of ""contingency options"" due to the pandemic.

""When people leave, I want it to be clear that the event posed no risk to public health,"" Barrett said.

This is Milwaukee's first national political convention, so a virtual convention would be disappointing to business owners, elected officials and local activists. Even so, some who favor holding the convention if it's safe are concerned about its safety.

""I don't want the people I represent to get sick and die because of this,"" said Democratic State Representative Daniel Riemer, who represents part of Milwaukee. He believes some sacrifices may have to be made and wants to hear assurances from party leaders and health experts.

""I would want them to look me in the face, so to speak, and to be able to look the people of my community in the face and say, 'You are no more at risk because this is happening and here's why,'"" Riemer said.

The convention was not only a chance to show off Milwaukee but also presented an opportunity to highlight the city's challenges, says Angela Lang, executive director of the Milwaukee group Black Leaders Organizing for Communities. But she, too, worries about the thousands of visitors who might infect Milwaukee residents.

We ""need to make sure that we're walking the walk and making sure that everyone is safe,"" Lang said. ""If that means not having an in-person convention and not risking the health and safety specifically of black and brown communities, we need to do that as a party.""

""FULL STEAM AHEAD"" FOR RNC

As one of 11 cities to ever host both parties' political conventions, Charlotte will hold this year's Republican National Convention just eight years after the Democratic National Convention was there in 2012. Charlotte won a bid for the convention in 2018, over the objections of some residents.

Robert Dawkins, political director for the grassroots community organization Action NC, explained that Charlotte residents feared the gathering could attract radical right-wing groups and white supremacists, but now, they might welcome it, if reluctantly.

""It's been hard and simmering bad feelings about this convention coming here for the past year,"" said Dawkins. ""You're going to find now that people are like, 'Charlotte's taken such a beating that if this convention goes along and has to still be in person, we're going to turn our noses and just let you do it just because COVID has cost us so much money.'""

In April, Republican National Committee Chair Ronna McDaniel tweeted the party is ""full steam ahead"" in planning for the event, which is scheduled for August 24-27. And the party is bringing in a health adviser to ensure the safety of convention attendees. McDaniel told the Washington Post that she's checking to see whether the federal government can provide protective equipment for both conventions.

Charlotte Assistant City Manager Angela Charles told CBS News that while COVID-19 has changed what it means to host an event safely, she's confident ""we've got the right people around the table to host it safely and securely.""

Charlotte City Councilwoman-at-large Dimple Ajmera, who voted against hosting the convention in 2018, has been receiving numerous emails from constituents.

""One resident said, 'Well, how can we go from gathering up just a few people now, to 50,000 in August?'"" Ajmera recalled. ""Some residents have said this feels like a slap in the face and this is not about politics, it's about people's lives.""

Another council member, Larken Egleston, who was one of four Democrats to vote in favor of hosting the convention, said it's too early to know how either convention should be modified, but called it ""foolish optimism"" to think it can be executed as originally planned.

""Some leadership around the RNC has said things like 'full steam ahead,'"" said Egleston, who is hoping to be a delegate for Joe Biden at the Democratic convention. ""That decision lies with our governor, with our state health director, with our county health director, and not with the president, not with the chair of the Republican National Convention.""

City Council member-at-large Braxton Winston III predicted that ""we're in trouble"" if we can't figure out how to ""make democracy work in a socially-distanced reality.""

He proposed top Republicans could meet at the Spectrum Center in Charlotte, while state delegations meet at large stadiums in their home state, such as the Staples Center in Los Angeles or Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium, to allow people to spread out.

""You're able to connect those folks through technology, but they are still able to meet together and caucus amongst each other,"" said Winston.

North Carolina state Senator Rob Bryan is the sole Republican representing Mecklenburg County in the state's general assembly. He reiterated that everyone, regardless of party, wants to keep people safe.

""Conversations go much better if you don't accuse the other person of wanting to kill people or you know, 'you want to kill all these businesses, you don't care because you've got a job still,'"" Bryan said, echoing what he's heard from some North Carolinians.

""IF YOU HAVE INFINITE RESOURCES AND A REALLY GOOD PLAN...""

Health experts in Wisconsin and North Carolina agree it's too early to tell what the pandemic will look like by convention time. It will depend on things like how well people follow social distancing and hygiene practices, testing and contact tracing abilities, as well as whether there's an effective treatment or vaccine — or flare-ups of the virus as states reopen. Dr. Anthony Fauci told lawmakers this week that he does not expect to see a vaccine by the time school begins in the fall, which would put it out of the reach of the conventions, too. These metrics will likely determine what type of event could be safe.

""You're going to have a second wave, no matter when you open,"" said Dr. Colby Ford, of the University of Charlotte's Bioinformatics Department. ""It's just how large is that second wave going to be, and can we hold off on reopening or reconvening in social settings until we have a way to combat the virus.""

""If there is a secondary wave, I think it's going to be difficult to really move ahead with plans for a significant convening here in Milwaukee,"" said Dr. John Raymond, president and CEO of the Medical College of Wisconsin.

Experts are concerned about bringing people from across the country into a single city for close interactions. Some states and cities may have the virus under control by August, while others may not.

""We have to put a bunch of people in the same place, the same city at the same time and that's really just asking for trouble because even if we reduce the number of people that come to the convention by 90%, it's still a lot more people in Charlotte than we normally have,"" said Ford.

""If you have infinite resources and a really good plan, it's possible,"" said Dr. James Conway, an infectious disease expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison's Global Health Institute. He recommended testing attendees and workers at the convention site and other businesses, along with screening for temperatures, frequent and thorough cleaning of event spaces, ""abundant"" hand sanitizer, social distancing and masks.

""The testing literally has to be, 'Are you shedding the virus right now?' and doing that on a reliable basis, at least at the beginning, and ideally you would do it every day."" Conway said. ""Anybody with a fever gets turned around and asked to leave and then goes and gets tested.""

But mass testing and other precautions could come at a huge cost and might pull resources away from state and local officials. Barrett suggested Congress should provide funding to help cover health costs related to both conventions, as they do for security.

CONVENTIONS COULD BE ""STIMULUS PACKAGE"" FOR BUSINESSES

In the past, convention week has been a boon for local businesses in the host city. The Democratic National Convention generated $230.9 million for Philadelphia in 2016 and brought in nearly $164 million for Charlotte in 2012, a record for a single event held in the city.

According to a report by the 2012 Tampa Bay Host committee, the Republican National Convention that year produced $214 million for the city, about $25 million more than the 2016 RNC generated for Cleveland.

The Democratic National Convention was part of a series of events that would put Milwaukee ""on the big stage with bright lights,"" said Tim Sheehy, president of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce. In addition to the convention, the Ryder Cup is supposed to take place about an hour outside of the city, and the Milwaukee Bucks were a favorite to make the NBA finals.

""The big stage and bright lights — those lights are flickering,"" Sheehy said. ""They haven't gone out, but they're clearly flickering.""

Some businesses were banking on a boost from the convention to keep their budgets afloat, like the Middle C Jazz club in Charlotte. It had only been open for four months before it closed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

""The RNC to Middle C would be a stimulus package [of] far greater value than anything that we could get through the government to help us survive as a new important business in Charlotte,"" said Larry Farber, the club's managing director.

Despite the potential economic benefit, most small business owners agree that health and safety are paramount. They're waiting for public health guidance on how they should proceed.

Ben Hebl, who owns Pourman's, a bar in downtown Milwaukee, has furloughed his 11 employees and closed his bar due to COVID-19. Even a small scale convention would ""cushion the blow,"" he says. But Hebl is worried about the risks that could come with people traveling to Milwaukee.

""I wish more than anything we could have it,"" Hebl said. ""If people started dying, I would be upset that we made that decision because I don't value money over human lives.""

North Carolina-based businessman Eric Burg insisted that there is ""absolutely a way"" to conduct a convention in August, by taking precautions, like using LED-sanitized stations. The event side of Burg's company, Apple Rock Displays, has seen an 80% loss in revenue due to COVID-19 but his team stayed afloat by making PPE, including face shields and masks for businesses.

""There are ways to do this and everyone knows how to do it,"" Burg said. ""You just have to conquer your fear and be able to get comfortable with it.""

That same day, in McAllen, Texas, a teenage girl from Guatemala completed a sworn asylum declaration, claiming she would be persecuted because of her race, indigenous identity and refusal to join a gang if returned to her home country. Hours later, ICE picked her up.

The sisters and the teenage girl have three things in common. They all previously sought asylum at the U.S.-Mexico border alongside parents. They were sent to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols, or MPP, program. And they reentered the U.S. a second time — without their parents.

Minors are not supposed to be returned to Mexico under MPP if unaccompanied by their parents or legal guardians, so some families have allowed their children to seek asylum in the U.S. alone. Between October 2019 and this month, at least 577 unaccompanied migrant children in the care of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, or ORR, have reported having their parents in Mexico, according to the agency.

Under a landmark court settlement, the U.S. government is obligated to make ""prompt and continuous efforts"" to unite unaccompanied migrant children with relatives or other sponsors in the U.S. while their immigration cases proceed.

But the government argues that children who have already been ordered removed with their families under the Remain in Mexico policy should be deported — even if they last entered the U.S. unaccompanied. Attorneys for the minors, however, say they should be treated like other unaccompanied migrant children.

Both the sisters and the teen girl have been fighting their case in court. A federal judge barred the government from immediately deporting the Salvadoran sisters, and they were released to their mother in Houston, according to attorneys. Their deportation proceedings are ongoing. Their father, with whom they were originally sent to Mexico, remains in Matamoros, Mexico.

The Guatemalan teen was transported by the government first to a motel in McAllen, then moved to another one in Alexandria, Louisiana, according to her attorneys. ICE was prepared to deport her on a flight Friday afternoon, according to Neha Desai, a lawyer who is part of the team representing all children in U.S. immigration custody. But her flight was postponed to Monday after the Guatemalan government said it would not receive the plane because of coronavirus cases among migrants recently deported by the U.S.

Judge Dolly Gee of the U.S. District Court in Los Angeles ruled on April 24 that deportation orders under the Remain in Mexico program do not change the government's obligation to seek the prompt release of migrant children to relatives and other sponsors in the U.S. under the landmark 1997 Flores Settlement Agreement.

""That policy just like any other pending proceedings or participation in class action proceedings or anything like that, if it results in a prolonged detention where deportation is not imminent, then it is causing unnecessary delay,"" Gee said during a hearing before issuing her order, which said the administration's ""opaque policies"" surrounding children with pending MPP cases violate the Flores settlement.

Advocates say ICE has seized on Gee's use of the word ""imminent"" to move to deport children in ORR care who have pending removal orders under the Remain in Mexico policy.

ICE said migrant children are only deported when ""their immigration case is complete and there are no legal impediments to removal.""

""If a minor received a final order of removal from an immigration judge as part of a family unit enrolled in the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) — prior to entering the U.S. as (an unaccompanied migrant child) — then they are subject to the final order of removal,"" an ICE spokeswoman said in a statement Friday.

The agency did not comment on specific cases or say how deporting migrant children from shelters overseen by the U.S. government conforms with the adjusted ""enforcement posture"" it announced in March as a result of the pandemic. In its announcement, ICE said its agents would only focus on detaining ""public safety risks,"" as well as immigrants whose criminal records require the agency to apprehend them. For everyone else, the agency said it would ""delay enforcement actions"" until the crisis abated.

Mark Weber, a spokesman for ORR, said his office does not determine which children in its custody are deported, calling it a child welfare agency.

Desai said she is concerned that the government's actions are related to Gee's decision that children who were previously returned to Mexico and came back unaccompanied should be released to sponsors.

""We can't concretely say it's retaliation, but it sure feels like it,"" Desai said, adding that she believed the government had intensified attempts to deport these children after Gee's ruling was made.

Asra Syed, who represents the sisters in Houston, said that in addition to being so near to their mother, there were no relatives in El Salvador who the children could be safely returned to. A redacted filing reviewed by CBS News included descriptions of abuse and gang threats during the girls' youth.

""Our clients are the only detained children we know of who ICE is insisting on deporting even though: 1) they have a parent in the U.S. who ORR recommends they be reunified with, 2) they have no parent or other relative in their home country who can take care of them, and 3) they are really, really young — only 8 and 11,"" Syed said.

ORR currently has roughly 1,600 migrant children in its custody, a low population level not seen since 2011.

More than 100 million smartphone users have downloaded the app since April 2, when the government rolled it out to fight the spread of the new virus. Promotion of the app, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was so successful that it reached 50 million downloads in just two weeks — one of the fastest uptakes for any app, ever.

India has an estimated 450 million smartphone users among its population of 1.3 billion. To cover more people, the government launched a version of Aarogya Setu for the roughly 100 million cheaper, but still-internet-enabled cell phones in use in the country.

Modi's government has made the app mandatory for people who work in public and private offices, for all train travellers and for people who live in areas deemed high-risk for the spread of the virus. There's even the threat of fines and jail terms for people who refuse to install the app in one Delhi suburb.

How contact tracing is being used in America's fight against coronavirus

So far, the app has alerted about 140,000 users to a possible COVID-19 infection risk, the Indian government said Monday.

But while the government insists the app is an important tool in its fight against coronavirus, it has raised concerns over personal privacy and other issues.

""Excessive"" data gathering

Concerns have also been raised over how much data the app collects. It asks its users to share their name, phone number, age, gender, profession, and details of countries visited in the last 30 days.

In addition, it asks users to self-assess for any possible COVID-19 symptoms and enter that data daily. The app shows users how many people have symptoms in a particular radius, and how many have tested positive. It sends alerts when a new person near you tests positive, or if someone who was near you previously tests positive.

But the way it does all this has raised concerns.

""The app collects both people's Bluetooth and GPS [data], which is inconsistent with principles of data minimization. It collects more personal and sensitive personal information than is required,"" the Internet Freedom Foundation, a New Delhi-based advocacy group, told CBS News in a statement.

Mishi Choudhary, legal director at the New York- based Software Freedom Law Center, agreed, telling CBS News that collecting GPS data, which records a user's location every 15 minutes, ""along with continuous Bluetooth data is excessive.""

""The Government is yet to publish the application's underlying source code. Nor has the government published specifications with regard to Bluetooth, cryptography or other technical features. This contrasts with the approaches in countries like Singapore, Australia, the U.K. or even Israel,"" the Internet Freedom Foundation said.

""No liability"" to protect data

Last week, an ""ethical hacker"" who identifies himself as Elliot Alderson, an alias inspired by a character in the TV series Mr. Robot, claimed the ""privacy of 90 million Indians is at stake"" due to ""security issues"" with the Indian app.

Hi @SetuAarogya, A security issue has been found in your app. The privacy of 90 million Indians is at stake. Can you contact me in private? Regards, PS: @RahulGandhi was right — Elliot Alderson (@fs0c131y) May 5, 2020

He claimed he was able to use the app to see whether anyone was sick in private homes - including the official residence of Prime Minister Modi: ""And yes, yesterday: 5 people felt unwell at the PMO office, 2 unwell at the Indian Army Headquarters, 1 infected people at the Indian parliament, 3 infected at the Home Office,"" he wrote on Twitter.

Soon after the hacker's claims, the Indian government released a statement thanking him, but insisting there was ""no data or security breach"" and that ""no personal information of any user has been proven to be at risk by this ethical hacker.""

""Alderson"" had previously raised red flags over alleged security flaws in India's national biometric identification system — the world's largest — which has gradually gone from voluntary to near-mandatory in the country.

Choudhary, of the Software Freedom Law Center, said that while India's government has addressed some concerns, ""several matters remain open,"" including the lack of government liability to protect data gathered by the app.

She said a clause in the official policy ""exempts the government from liability in the event of 'any unauthorized access to the [user's] information or modification thereof.'""

""This means that there is no liability for the government, even if the personal information of users are leaked,"" said Choudahary.

India's Communications, Electronics and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has said Aarogya Setu ""has a robust data security architecture.""

How does it compare?

""India has no national data privacy law, and it's not clear who has access to data from the app and in what situations,"" researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) have said in a review. The team at MIT ranks various COVID tracing tracker apps around the world for their transparency and other factors, and Aarogya Setu met just two of its five criteria.

""There are no strong, transparent policy or design limitations on accessing or using the data at this point,"" the researchers say, while noting that India is the ""only democracy making its app mandatory for millions of people.""

U.K. launches tracing app to track COVID-19

Systems being used in Singapore, Australia, Norway, Israel, Czech Republic, Iceland and Austria all scored a perfect 5 on the MIT index, which reviewed apps implemented by a total of 25 countries.

Only China, which failed to meet any of the criteria due to the complete secrecy of its app, and Turkey, Bulgaria, France, Ghana, Iran, Ireland, and Malaysia — which all met just 1 of the 5 criteria — have worse scores than India.

The U.S. hasn't yet rolled out a national tracking app, but the government is working with technology companies to get one into use.

""Sophisticated surveillance system?""

Some fear India's app could be used in a way that would violate civil liberties, including by helping to build a state surveillance system that could be exploited after the app outlives its coronavirus-tracking purpose.

Indian opposition leader Rahul Gandhi has called the app ""a sophisticated surveillance system, outsourced to a pvt [private] operator, with no institutional oversight.""

The Arogya Setu app, is a sophisticated surveillance system, outsourced to a pvt operator, with no institutional oversight - raising serious data security & privacy concerns. Technology can help keep us safe; but fear must not be leveraged to track citizens without their consent. — Rahul Gandhi (@RahulGandhi) May 2, 2020

""In Europe, the data has largely been aggregated and anonymized,"" noted the MIT Technology Review.

Concerns that the app could be used as a surveillance tool come with the backdrop of an existing trust deficit between the government and many citizens. Hundreds took part in protests, which turned deadly, against the government's plan to roll out a National Register of Citizens (NRC), along with a new citizenship law widely criticized as racist for singling out Muslims.

Concessions, and expansion

As coronavirus cases in India mount — over 82,000 cases and 2,600 deaths so far — the government has tried to address concerns about its tracking app.

On Monday, the government said it would give users an option to seek deletion of their data within 30 days of making a request. It also issued new data processing ""guidelines"" to various agencies involved in controlling the spread of the virus, banning storage of data for more than six months and warning violators they could face jail time.

""Lot of work has been done over data privacy. A good privacy policy has been made to ensure that personal data of people are not misused,"" Ajay Prakash Sawhney, an official with India's Ministry of Electronics and Internet Technology, said Monday.

Without a national data protection law, however, the concerns over the app's privacy and data safeguards — and its mandatory use for millions — won't easily be laid to rest.

India's parliament has been considering such legislation since last year. The man who wrote the draft, Justice B N Srikrishna, a former Supreme Court justice, told The Indian Express that the government's move to make the app obligatory for so many people was ""utterly illegal"".

""Under what law do you mandate it on anyone? So far it is not backed by any law,"" said the former judge.

The New Delhi based Internet Freedom Foundation has challenged the legality of an order by authorities in the Delhi suburb of Noida making installation of the app mandatory for everyone, and threatening violators with possible fines, or even jail.

The government, meanwhile, is considering expanding the mandate for the app. It already covers all train travelers, and it may also apply to air passengers once the world's biggest COVID-lockdown lifts and flights resume.",100,High,Left-center

The new rule is the latest in a wave of stricter policies that tech companies are rolling out to confront an outbreak of virus-related misinformation on their sites. Facebook and Google, which owns YouTube, have already put similar systems in place.

The announcement signals that Twitter is taking its role in amplifying misinformation more seriously. But how the platform enforces its new policy will be the real test, with company leaders already tamping down expectations.

Yoel Roth, Twitter's head of site integrity, acknowledged as much: ""We will not be able to take enforcement action on every tweet with incomplete or disputed information about COVID-19.""

Roth said Monday the platform has historically applied a ""lighter touch"" when enforcing similar policies on misleading tweets but said the company is working to improve the technology around the labels.

An example of how Twitter will alert users to tweets that spread misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic. Twitter

In February, Twitter said it would add warning labels to doctored or manipulated photos and videos after a recording of Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was slowed down to make it appear as though she slurred her words. But even with obviously fake videos, such as one showing Joe Biden lolling his tongue and grinning that was shared by President Donald Trump, the company has since used the label only twice, in part because of technical glitches.

And Twitter has not added any warning labels to politicians' tweets that violate its policies but are deemed in the ""public interest"" under a policy the company announced in June 2019.

Under the newest COVID-19 rules, Twitter will decide which tweets are labeled — only taking down posts if they are harmful.

Politicians' tweets will be subject to the notices, which will be available in roughly 40 languages.

Some of the questionable tweets will run with a label underneath that directs users to a link with additional information about COVID-19. Other tweets might be covered entirely by a warning label alerting users that ""some or all of the content shared in this tweet conflict with guidance from public health experts regarding COVID-19.""

Twitter won't directly fact check or call tweets false on the site, said Nick Pickles, the company's global senior strategist for public policy. The warning labels might send users to curated tweets, public health websites or news articles.

""People don't want us to play the role of deciding for them what's true and what's not true but they do want people to play a much stronger role providing context,"" Pickles said.

The notices, which could start appearing as soon as today, could also apply retroactively to past tweets.

The fine line is similar to one taken by tech rival Facebook, which has said it doesn't want to be an ""arbiter of the truth"" but has arranged for third-party fact checkers to review falsehoods on its site. The Associated Press is part of Facebook's fact-checking program.

One example of a disputed tweet that might be labeled on its site includes claims about the origin of COVID-19, which remains unknown. Conspiracy theories about how the virus started and if it is man-made have swirled around social media for months.

The War on Science

Twitter will continue to take down COVID-19 tweets that pose a threat to the safety of a person or group, along with attempts to incite mass violence or widespread civil unrest. The company has been removing bogus coronavirus cures and claims that social distancing or face masks do not curb the virus' spread for several weeks.",100,High,Left-center

Just three weeks ago, he was discharged after a battle against COVID-19.

""I started wondering, how bad is this going to be?"" he said. ""Am I close to dying?

Clark took part in a groundbreaking global trial with early results that showed remdesivir reduced average hospitalizations from 15 to 11 days.

Dr. Aneesh Mehta was the lead investigator of the National Institute of Health trial at Emory University, where she is chief of infectious diseases.

""I think remdesivir, it's going to be one important tool, but we also need to look for other ways to help our patients,"" Mehta said.

In the next phase of the trial, Mehta and her colleagues are adding even more fire power to the fight against COVID-19.

Combining remdesivir — to stop the virus from multiplying — with a powerful anti-inflammatory drug, Baricitinib, a so-called immune modulator that aims to prevent organ damage by calming down an inflamed immune system.

Remdesivir stops the virus from replicating inside the cell. and the immune modulator puts out the fire.

""What the remdesivir here does is it stops the spark and the immune modulator will hopefully be putting dirt on the fire to put it out,"" Mehta said. "" A one-two punch.""



Mehta's team is looking at whether this powerful combination could make recovery even faster and possibly reduce the mortality rate.in a way remdesivir alone has not yet been shown to do.

It's a multiple-drug strategy based on years of AIDS research.

""A drug can block this virus,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, when he announced remdesivir was the first drug shown to be effective in treating COVID-19.

It was reminiscent of a time more than three decades ago when the first HIV treatment emerged.

""It was reminiscent of 34 years ago, in 1986, when we were struggling for drugs for HIV and we had nothing,"" Fauci said.

It took nearly 10 years to show a combination of drugs was needed to treat AIDS. Now they're applying that lesson learned to COVID-19.",100,High,Left-center

Kelly is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown Chicago. The Bureau of Prisons said there are currently 18 confirmed active COVID-19 cases among inmates and 14 among jail staff; while 122 inmates and 16 staff have recovered from the virus.

Kelly's lawyers argued medical tests showed he is ""likely diabetic,"" and at a higher risk of contacting COVID-19 or a severe illness. But Judge Ann Donnelly said she did not believe prediabeties presents a ""compelling reason for the defendant's release.""

Donnelly also agreed with prosecutors that Kelly posed a flight risk, noting that he is accused of paying and intimidating witnesses for their silence. Donnelly also noted that judges in other jurisdictions where Kelly has been charged have also found he is a flight risk and a danger.

The data reflects an ongoing trend —2020 is on track to see the largest yearly global decline ever in emissions.

According to an analysis released Tuesday by researchers at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA), decreased electricity use and competition from renewable energy sources like wind and solar have weakened demand for fossil fuels in the last year. However, the unexpected lockdown prompted by the coronavirus pandemic is what finally reversed India's 37-year emissions growth trend.

Since early 2019, India has seen a weakened demand for thermal power generation, researchers said. But not until the lockdowns began in March did growth fall below zero, dropping 15 percent that month, and likely about 30 percent in April.

Researchers say the economic slowdown caused by the pandemic has cut India's electricity usage, reducing the need for coal. Coal-fired power generation fell 15 percent in March and 31 percent in the first three weeks of April, while renewables increased by 6.4 percent in March and decreased slightly by 1.4 percent in April.

Coal deliveries were already down 2 percent year-over-year in March, but they have since fallen at least another 10 percent, with imports falling 27.5 percent, the CREA researchers said.

Oil consumption decreased 18 percent in March compared to the previous year. Consumption grew just .2 percent during the fiscal year — the slowest growth in at least 22 years — mostly due to lockdown measures, researchers said. Crude oil production also fell 5.9 percent and refinery production fell 1.1 percent.

Smog has decreased significantly in New Delhi, India during the coronavirus lockdown. Getty

Based on the data for coal, oil and gas consumption, researchers estimate that CO2 emissions fell by 30 metric tons. India saw declines in 1970, 1974, 1980 and 1984 — but those dips were minimal compared to this year's decrease.

It's unclear if the country will be able to sustain these environmental improvements after it reopens. The U.S. has relaxed environmental regulations during the pandemic, and there are fears that other counties could do the same.

""The longer-term outlook for India's emissions will be shaped, to a significant degree, by the government response to the crisis,"" researchers said. It ""will have major long-term implications for India's CO2 emissions and air quality trajectory.""

Analysts see three possibilities for governmental intervention needed to keep emissions low: Efforts to reinvigorate renewable energy programs after the lockdown; bailouts and structural changes following massively decreased electricity demand; and a desire to continue combating air pollution after experiencing such drastic improvement in air quality.

Several places in India are already feeling optimistic as they experience clear, blue skies for themselves.

New study says coronavirus detected on tiny particles of air pollution

""In each case, the crisis could act to catalyze, reinforce or accelerate the factors that have already been driving Indian policymaking in this area,"" researchers said. ""Such improvements in air quality are anomalies and if left unchecked following the lockdowns, air pollution will return swiftly and the threats to human health and wellbeing linked to it will persist.""

Increased air pollution leads populations to be more vulnerable to COVID-19 and other respiratory diseases, giving governments even more of an incentive to maintain the environmental benefits seen by lockdowns.

And while India implemented its strict nationwide lockdown on March 25, it began easing restrictions earlier this month as part of a multi-phase reopening strategy. The country has seen a dramatic spike in infections since relaxing regulations, with over 73,000 confirmed cases and over 2,400 deaths as of Tuesday.",100,High,Left-center

Neither publications have met the foreign ministry's demand for a retraction.

Moscow's Health Department reacted to the press reports on Wednesday with a statement saying that more than 60% of deaths among the city's coronavirus patients are not being included in the official virus death toll because their deaths resulted from underlying causes. Officials said autopsies are being conducted in all suspected coronavirus deaths, and defended their methodology as ""exceptionally precise.""

The city where it all started, Wuhan, China, is on alert again. Over the next 10 days, authorities in China's coronavirus epicenter are testing every one of its 11 million residents after six new coronavirus cases were reported over the weekend.

Those were the first positive tests in Wuhan in 35 days, since the city celebrated the lifting of a 76-day lockdown on April 8.

In neighboring South Korea, authorities in the capital city of Seoul have ordered more than 2,000 clubs and bars to close again after a new cluster of more than 100 COVID-19 cases was traced to the popular entertainment district of Itaewon.

A gay man in his 20's, who later tested positive for the virus, is believed to have visited several clubs there.

More than 8,000 police have reportedly been deployed in Seoul to trace almost 11,000 people who were in the area, using mobile phone data and credit card transactions.

""If the government of Korea hadn't done this, then there would be 119 people out there infecting other people. So that actually gets to the point of tracing people,"" explained Dr. Jerome Kim, a leading epidemiologist in the country.

In Russia, meanwhile, there's been more tragedy on top of the still-mounting infections. A fire at a hospital in St. Petersburg killed at least four coronavirus patients this week — the second deadly blaze in just four days linked preliminarily to ventilator machines.

The pandemic has also hit close to President Vladimir Putin again: his spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, has been hospitalized for treatment — the latest in a series of high-ranking officials close to the Russian leader to catch the virus.

And the pandemic has now hit close to President Vladimir Putin: His spokesperson Dmitry Peskov has been with the coronavirus. Peskov's wife has also contracted the virus.

In Japan, meanwhile, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe says the country is on a ""steady"" path to ending its epidemic. His government may lift the national state of emergency for much of the country as soon as Thursday — more than two weeks earlier than the current May 31 expiry date.

Tokyo, however, may remain under the emergency declaration. The capital has been hit the hardest by the pandemic, with nearly one out of three infections in Japan recorded in the city.",100,High,Left-center

Instead, WHO Emergencies Director Dr. Mike Ryan said the novel coronavirus will be hard to wipe out completely.

According to John Hopkins University's latest data, more than 4.4 million people worldwide have been infected and nearly 300,000 have died from COVID-19. And the end of the virus may not be in sight anytime soon, Ryan said.

""I think its important to put this on the table: this virus may become just another endemic virus in our communities, and this virus may never go away,"" Ryan said.

He brought up the fact that HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is still around decades later, but therapies have allowed people with the virus to live ""long, healthy lives.""

""HIV has not gone away, but we have come to terms with the virus and we have found the therapies and we found the prevention methods and people don't feel as scared as they did before,"" he said. ""And we're offering life to people with HIV. Long, healthy lives to people with HIV. And I'm not comparing the two diseases, but I think it is important that we should be realistic. And I don't think anyone can predict when or if this disease will disappear.""

More than 100 potential coronavirus vaccines are in development, according to WHO. Ryan expressed optimism on ""eliminating this virus"" if a vaccine is developed and distributed throughout the world. ""That vaccine will have to be available, it'll have to be highly effective, it will have to be made available to everyone and we will have to use it,"" he said.

But Ryan pointed out that the existence of a vaccine does not guarantee global protection. He mentioned that before the pandemic struck, medical teams were working with young children in Samoa who were on ventilators: The children gotten sick with measles and were not vaccinated against it, even though a safe and effective vaccine has existed for decades.

""Forgive me if I am cynical but we have perfectly effective vaccines on this planet that we have not used effectively for diseases we could eliminate and eradicate — and we haven't done it,"" he said.

Even with a vaccine, Ryan said every single step in combating the virus has its challenges, but overcoming them will serve as a window into countries working together down the road.

""It's a massive opportunity for the world,"" he said. ""The idea that a new disease could emerge, cause a pandemic and we could with a massive moonshot find a vaccine and give that to everyone that needs it and stop this disease in its tracks will turn maybe what has been a tragic pandemic into a beacon of hope to the future of our planet in the way we care for our citizens.""",100,High,Left-center

The condition, called pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, has been reported in more than a dozen states across the U.S., including Louisiana, Mississippi, California and New York. Over 100 children have been affected in New York alone, three of whom died, according to Governor Andrew Cuomo.

Doctors had suspected early on that coronavirus played a role in the new disorder by triggering an excessive immune reaction, but there was no clear proof that the two were linked.

Reported in The Lancet medical journal, the new evidence comes from doctors in Bergamo, the epicenter of coronavirus infections and deaths in Italy, where the nationwide reported death toll is more than 30,000, behind only Britain and the United States.

Doctors at the Papa Giovanni XXIII hospital compared a series of 10 cases of the illness with cases of a similar rare condition in children called Kawasaki disease, finding a 30-fold increase in cases of Kawasaki-like disease in patients between February and April.

The acceleration of cases occurred at a pace of about one every three months, indicating a cluster that was fueled by the coronavirus outbreak, especially, the authors noted, since overall hospital admissions were much lower than usual during national stay-at-home orders.

""Our study provides the first clear evidence of a link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and this inflammatory condition, and we hope it will help doctors around the world as we try to get to grips with this unknown virus,"" said Dr. Lorenzo D'Antiga, director of child health at the hospital, in The Guardian.

None of the 10 children in Bergamo died, but the authors reported that their symptoms were much more severe than those of the children with Kawasaki disease. Heart complications were more common, as were lower counts of platelets. A type of white blood cell typical of coronavirus patients was also more prevalent.

Five of the children experienced shock, which did not occur in any of the Kawasaki patients.

The researchers also highlighted that eight of the 10 children tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies, indicating that the children had been infected with the virus weeks earlier. They suspect that the two other children may have been false negatives, due to imperfect tests.

While Kawasaki disease tends to strike infants and preschoolers, the 10 children with the mysterious disorder were generally several years older. The average age of the Kawasaki patients was 3; the average age of the children with this condition was 7 and a half.

The doctors warn that the ""strong association"" between the coronavirus and the inflammatory condition should be taken into account as governments around the world ease lockdown restrictions.

But they also stressed that the disorder is exceedingly rare, diagnosed in no more than one in 1,000 children exposed to the virus. Only a small fraction require intensive care, and even fewer die.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said it will soon issue an alert asking doctors to report cases of children with symptoms of the syndrome.",100,High,Left-center

Rome — Italy will give temporary work permits to more than half a million undocumented migrants deemed essential to picking crops and caring for the elderly amid the country's coronavirus lockdown as part of a stimulus package agreed late Wednesday.



""We have worked on this decree knowing that the country is in great difficulty,"" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said after a cabinet meeting.

For more than two months, stay-at-home orders have prevented seasonal laborers from Eastern Europe traveling to Italy to work in farming. The glut of farm hands has fueled fears of food shortages and led the agriculture industry to rely on an estimated 500,000 illicitly hired, unregistered migrants, largely from North Africa, as spring crops ripen in the fields.

""The food on our table comes from these fields. Now we must hand over those rights which have been denied to those who work in them,"" said Peppe Provenzano, minister for the south of Italy.

U.S. farmers struggle with coronavirus' effect on labor

Agriculture lobbies had warned that Italy risked wasting massive amounts of produce if nobody was there to pick it, exacerbating the fallout of a shutdown already costing the food sector more than $7.5 billion in the country.



The measure approved Wednesday was proposed by Agriculture Minister Teresa Bellanova as part of a long-delayed stimulus package of nearly $60 billion meant to help Italy's beleaguered businesses and families weather the pandemic and lockdown.



""This decree provides the prerequisites so that this phase of reopening can immediately offer the prospect of an economic and social recovery,"" Conte told journalists.



Proponents of the measure say it will advance public health interests, too, as migrants won't need to hide from authorities any longer in squats and camps where poor hygiene conditions make fertile ground for coronavirus clusters.



The move came after Pope Francis decried ""farm hands exploited in the countryside,"" saying ""dignity should be given to work,"" with proper pay and safe conditions.

Italy struggles to find space for bodies despite flattening virus curve

The measure also applies to about 100,000 undocumented migrants who assist the elderly — the demographic most severely at risk in an outbreak that has already killed 31,106 people in Italy. It's the third-highest recorded death toll in the world, after the United States and Britain.



Nonetheless, the decree sparked a major controversy in a country whose gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to shrink by more than 9% and where unemployment is projected to reach 12.7% by the end of the year, according to the International Monetary Fund.



Opposition leader Matteo Salvini, of the nationalist League party, blasted the decision in a Twitter post, saying: ""Why should we ever reward those illegals and those who exploit them when there are so many Italians and legal migrants looking for a job?""



The hardline position was previously backed by the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement (M5S), which shares power with the center-left Democrats in a coalition government. But M5S dropped its opposition as it risked toppling the fragile coalition under Prime Minister Conte.



Located just a few hundred miles from the coast of North Africa, Italy has been by far the largest European destination for migrants setting sail from Libya and Tunisia in the past decade.

16,000 migrants have fled to Lesbos this year – and there’s only one humanitarian boat left to help

More than 6 million migrants were living in Italy in 2019. More than 500,000 of them were undocumented, according to an annual report by the Ismu Foundation, a think-tank focused on migration issues.



The stimulus package, originally promised last month, takes immediate effect, and comes on the heels of an initial $27 billion package introduced in March. It includes a mix of tax cuts and grants to help businesses survive the economic downturn, while also aiming to help families with subsidies for childcare, and to boost the ravaged tourism sector.",100,High,Left-center

Penney, one of America's most recognizable clothing stores, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy late Friday. In doing so, the 118-year-old store became the latest major retailer to succumb to a sales slump during the coronavirus pandemic.

J.C. Penney was one of many brick-and-mortar stores forced to temporarily close its locations as the pandemic spread across the U.S. The closures put J.C. Penney a step closer to bankruptcy, the company said Friday.

CEO Jill Soltau said in a statement Friday that J.C. Penney's leadership made significant progress toward rebuilding the company, but ""the closure of our stores due to the pandemic necessitated a more fulsome review to include the elimination of outstanding debt.""

J.C. Penney officials said its physical and online stores will remain open during the bankruptcy restructuring. The company has already begun reopening some locations, including in Arizona, Florida, Georgia and Texas. The Plano-based clothing store filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. Southern District of Texas.

Although the pandemic further dented J.C. Penney, the store has been declining for years amid the growth in e-commerce, and is weighed down by $4 billion in debt. It has closed numerous stores in recent years to cut costs.

J.C. Penney has $500 million in cash and has commitments from lenders for another $900 million to help the company get through its structuring, company officials said. J.C. Penney plans to close more stores as part of the bankruptcy, but company officials didn't specify which ones or how many.

Soltau said bankruptcy ""is the best path to ensure that JCPenney will build on its over 100-year history to serve our customers for decades to come.""

J.C. Penney, which has roughly 85,000 employees, has now joined Neiman Marcus and J. Crew among the retailers to go bankrupt since the virus struck. In its most recent quarter J.C. Penney's sales fell nearly 8%, to $3.4 billion, from the year-ago period, while income was $27 million, down from $75 million a year ago. J.C. Penney missed two debt payments in April and May, which many analysts saw as a harbinger of bankruptcy.

""J.C. Penney actually embraced e-commerce earlier than most other U.S. department store chains, but the company did not capitalize on this head start,"" Bob Hoyler, senior research analyst at Euromonitor International, said in a statement to CBS News. ""J.C. Penney has not been able to survive on its e-commerce sales alone during the pandemic, so the forced store closures represent months of revenue that will simply never be recouped.""

The company's bankruptcy comes days after J.C. Penney gave its top executives millions of dollars in bonus pay. CEO Jill Soltau received $4.5 million, while chief financial officer Bill Wafford, chief merchant officer Michelle Wlazlo and chief human resources officer Brynn Evanson each got $1 million, the company disclosed in a May 10 regulatory filing.

Large companies give so-called retention bonuses to top executives to encourage corporate leaders to remain on board as the company restructures and, if possible, exit court supervision as stronger competitors.

His last two albums debuted atop the country and rock charts and each won him a pair of Grammys.

But he recorded his new album, ""Reunions,"" in what now seems like another time. It will be released Friday, in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.

""That's not what I planned on, but I would have been super disappointed if I had to wait,"" Isbell told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Anthony Mason. ""And I think, you know, people don't need music any less right now than they will a year from now.""

He needs it even more now, he said. ""I need to feel a connection with people.""

On their farm outside Nashville, Isbell and his wife, the musician Amanda Shires, have been hunkering down at home with their 4-year-old daughter, Mercy.

Mercy can tell something is different, Isbell said.

""She even kind of misses being on tour 'cause, you know, she goes on tour with us. So she's said a few times, 'Can we pretend we're in a hotel today, Daddy?' I'm like, 'Yeah, we can do that,'"" he said.

Isbell said he doesn't know when he will be back on tour.

""Sometimes I let myself think about how nice it will be to play shows again with my band and with an audience and ride around and see new things, but I don't stay there for too awful long 'cause then I get sad,"" he said.

He has found this time challenging, he told Mason. ""You know, we lost John Prine a month ago, and that's been devastating for us.""

Prine died of the coronavirus in early April. Isbell and Shires both had performed on his final album, ""The Tree of Forgiveness,"" and had toured with the revered singer-songwriter.

""When John passed, it occurred to me that, you know, there's no such thing as overreacting at this point because if John's loss had been the only one, it would still be enough to keep us in the house for however long it takes,"" Isbell said.

So, he's been performing his new music from the studio in his barn. Isbell has said that he dealt with a lot of ghosts on his new record.

""I didn't know that's what was happening while I was writing the songs,"" he said.

One of those ghosts was his own: the alcoholic Isbell before his recovery eight years ago.

""For the first few years after I got sober and straightened my life up, it was dangerous for me to forgive myself,"" Isbell said. ""Because I didn't want to turn back into that guy.""

""You're okay being with that guy again?"" Mason asked.

""Yeah, for once, and it's taken a long time 'cause, I mean, everybody has that friend that, you know, they can't hang out with 'cause it's like, if I go out with that guy tonight, I'm going to wind up in trouble. Well, that was my own self, you know?"" Isbell said.

Isbell said the pressure to live up to his earlier albums also meant ""Reunions"" had a somewhat tortured birth.

""We could have had a better time, but I don't think we could have made a better album,"" he said. ""And, you know, now the album's done. We can have a good time now.""",100,High,Left-center

""It's a very long road still… but we are in the beginning of recovery and him waking up,"" she posted. ""...What a miracle.""

Cordero was initially hospitalized March 30 after being diagnosed with pneumonia. He later tested positive for coronavirus, and was intubated April 1.

In addition to dealing with pneumonia, he also went into septic shock, had two ""mini strokes,"" had a temporary pacemaker placed, and suffered from blood clotting complications which resulted in his right leg being amputated, according to Kloots.

She told ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King that the ordeal was ""terrifying,"" but that she has tried to remain positive throughout Cordero's healing process.

""I feel like there is an army of people behind him, behind us,"" she told King in April. ""… And I just believe — I get chills saying it — I just believe that he will wake up.""

Matt Damon and his family are self-isolating in the small seaside town of Dalkey in Ireland.

Since Dalkey is not used to hosting A-list celebrities, the actor has become the talk of the town. Damon agreed to an interview on an Irish radio show, ""Fully Charged,"" where the hosts asked him to surprise a fan who just happens to be a nurse on the front lines of the coronavirus battle.

To kick off the interview, Damon explained that he was in Europe filming a movie when production moved to Ireland but then shut down due to coronavirus.

Rather than fly home, he and his family chose to stay put in Dalkey, and they've been there for about two months now.

""I don't know if you're fully aware that the Dalkey people are protecting you like a glorious gem,"" radio host Nathan O'Reilly told Damon during the interview.

Locals have even created a Facebook group to track Damon — and he's aware of it. ""That's when I realized how great this place was and how protective everybody is here,"" Damon said. ""I had no idea this was happening behind the scenes."" O'Reilly admitted joining the group to try and find Damon for the interview.

The reason Damon agreed to do the interview was because a famous friend convinced him to. U2 singer Bono lives nearby, and while the pals can't see each other face to face due to social distancing rules, they have been FaceTiming. On one call, the Irish singer told Damon: ""You know, there's a local radio station that's looking for you.""

""That was the final impetus for me,"" Damon said. ""I was like, 'I really got to check those guys out and call into the show.'"" The hosts were absolutely delighted that Bono helped facilitate the interview, which they conducted with Damon via video conference.

Damon called Dalkey ""incredible"" and one of the most beautiful places his family has ever been. ""Obviously what's going on in the world is horrible, but for my family, it timed out right,"" Damon said. ""I'm with my whole family and I have my kids and we have teachers with us because we were planning on missing school for about eight weeks. So we have what nobody has, which is live human beings teaching our kids.""

Damon knows this is a luxury for parents in a time of remote learning. He's also grateful that in a time when travel is limited, he's stuck in a picturesque place.

Damon said while most of his family is together in Ireland, his eldest daughter, Alexia, from his wife Luciana Bozán Barroso's previous marriage, is in college in New York City. She and her roommates had COVID-19 ""early on,"" Damon said, adding ""she got through it fine,"" and she will reunite with the rest of the family at the end of the month.

Of course, the hosts couldn't end the interview without asking Damon about ""Contagion,"" the prescient 2011 film about an uncontrollable pandemic. ""You're oddly prepared for this because you were in 'Contagion.' Life is literally imitating art now,"" host Graham O'Toole said.

Damon said has spoken to screenwriter Scott Burns and some of the people who consulted on the movie about the current pandemic. ""Anybody who says you couldn't predict this, just look at 'Contagion.' I mean, 10 years ago we made a movie just by talking to experts and asking them how this would look and how it would kind of go down,"" Damon said.

""The whole thing is just tragic and sad. I hope some good can come out of it. Luckily, this isn't as lethal as it might've been, so maybe this is a dry run for the big one that might come along, because these things do come along every few decades,"" he continued. ""Best to be ready for it.""

To end the interview, the hosts had Damon surprise a nurse who asked if there was any way she could see him. The nurse, Anais, who is from France but lives in Dublin, was shocked to see Damon join the video conference. ""I just can't breathe at all,"" she said.

Damon thanked Anais for all she and other frontline workers are doing. ""I feel like that is the one thing to come out of this — we will never ever ever look at you guys the same. And that's a good thing,"" he told the nurse.",100,High,Left-center

The movie ""Trolls"" will be playing this weekend at the Fingerlakes Drive-In in Auburn, New York, roughly 30 miles from Syracuse, according to its owner, Paul Meyer, a commercial real estate developer who bought the business eight years ago and who estimates there are about 30 drive-ins across the state.

""Drive-ins by design are excellent places to go for social distancing,"" Meyer told CBS MoneyWatch. ""I expect we'll have a good season this year.""

In operation since 1947, the business is the oldest continuously operated drive-in theater in the state, said Meyer, who is still thinking through all the logistics of keeping patrons six feet apart at the concession stand and in lines for the bathroom. His three employees and customers will be required to wear masks, he said.

There are 305 drive-in theaters around the U.S., with at least one in every state except for Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Louisiana and North Dakota, according to the United Drive-In Theatre Owners Association.

It's not the first time that drive-ins, which first appeared in the U.S. in the years following the Great Depression, have been touted as a refuge from disease. In the early 1950s, when the U.S. faced a major polio epidemic, the theaters sometimes pitched themselves as ""flu and polio protected,"" according to an account by Food and Wine.

""It's a responsibility on our side to be as safe as possible,"" Stephen Sauerbeck, owner of Sauerbeck Family Drive-In Theater in La Grange, Kentucky, told The New York Times.

And apparently the rule doesn't only apply to humans — an asteroid speeding toward Earth appears to know about the pandemic and is sporting a face mask of its own.

An asteroid called 52768 (1998 OR2) will zoom past Earth next week. Astronomers at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico are tracking the asteroid, and couldn't help but notice a familiar silhouette after capturing a new radar view of the object.

""The small-scale topographic features such as hills and ridges on one end of asteroid 1998 OR2 are fascinating scientifically,"" research scientist Anne Virkki said in a press release Thursday. ""But since we are all thinking about COVID-19 these features make it look like 1998 OR2 remembered to wear a mask.""

A team at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico took this range-Doppler radar image of Asteroid 1998OR2 on April 17. University of Florida

But don't worry — the asteroid has no chance of becoming infected with the virus.

Arecibo data confirmed that 1998 OR2 is about 1.2 miles across and rotates approximately once every four hours. Scientists at NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object Studies said it will make its closest approach to Earth on April 29, but it will still be 16 times farther away than the moon — nearly four million miles.

1998 OR2 is classified as a Potentially Hazardous Object, which are larger than 500 feet and come within 5 million miles of Earth's orbit. After its discovery, NASA said it is ""large enough to cause global effects"" if it impacted Earth, but poses no threat to the planet.

And it won't be the only time the asteroid pays Earth a visit. And next time, it'll come a little closer.

""The radar measurements allow us to know more precisely where the asteroid will be in the future, including its future close approaches to Earth,"" says Flaviane Venditti, a research scientist at the observatory. ""In 2079, asteroid 1998 OR2 will pass Earth about 3.5 times closer than it will this year, so it is important to know its orbit precisely.""

Arecibo said that scientists continue to monitor asteroids for planetary defense purposes, but are following proper social distancing guidelines and wearing masks while making observations.",100,High,Left-center

So why did the president just cancel Daszak's funding? It's the kind of politics which might seem ill-advised in a health crisis. President Trump is blaming China's government for the pandemic. The outbreak was first detected in the city of Wuhan. The administration has said, at times, the virus is man-made or that, if it's natural, it must have leaked out of a Chinese government lab. Both the White House and the Chinese Communist Party have been less than honest. And so, in China, and the U.S., the work of scientists like Peter Daszak is being undercut by pandemic politics.

Peter Daszak is a British-born American Ph.D. who's spent a career discovering dangerous viruses in wildlife, especially bats.

In 2003, in Malaysia, he warned 60 Minutes a pandemic was coming.

Peter Daszak in 2003 interview: What worries me the most is that we are going to miss the next emerging disease, that we're suddenly going to find a SARS virus that moves from one part of the planet to another, wiping out people as it moves along.

Peter Daszak

In the 17 years since that prophecy, Peter Daszak became president of the New York-based EcoHealth Alliance.

Peter Daszak: We're a nonprofit research organization that focuses on understanding where the pandemics come from, what's the risk of future pandemics and can we get in between this pandemic and the next one and disrupt it and stop it.

In China, EcoHealth has worked for 15 years with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Together they've catalogued hundreds of bat viruses, research that is critical right now.

Peter Daszak: The breakthrough drug, Remdesivir, that seems to have some impact on COVID-19 was actually tested against the viruses we discovered under our NIH research funding.

Scott Pelley: And so that testing would not have been possible--

Peter Daszak: No, it would not.

Scott Pelley: --if it hadn't been for the work that you did with the NIH grant?

Peter Daszak: Correct.

But his funding from the NIH, the U.S. National Institutes of Health, was killed, two weeks ago, by a political disinformation campaign targeting China's Wuhan Institute.

On April 14, Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz claimed China's Wuhan Institute had, quote, ""birthed a monster."" Gaetz is a vigorous defender of the president. He's been under investigation by the House Ethics Committee for allegedly threatening a witness against Mr. Trump and he led a protest to delay impeachment testimony.

U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Florida, speaks during a rally hosted by FreedomWorks on Sept. 26, 2018, at the West Lawn of the Capitol in Washington, D.C. Getty

Matt Gaetz on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"": The NIH gives this $3.7 million grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, they then advertise that they need coronavirus researchers. Following that, coronavirus erupts in Wuhan.

There never was a $3.7 million U.S. grant to the Wuhan lab. But, the falsehood spread like a virus, in the White House, and without verification, in the briefing room.

Reporter in White House press briefing: There's also another report that the NIH, under the Obama administration, in 2015 gave that lab $3.7 million in a grant. Why would the U.S. give a grant like that to China?

President Trump: The Obama administration gave them a grant of $3.7 million? I've been hearing about that. And we've instructed that if any grants are going to that area – we're looking at it, literally, about an hour ago, and also early in the morning. We will end that grant very quickly.

That grant was to Peter Daszak's U.S.-based EcoHealth Alliance for disease prevention it does throughout the world. His work was considered so important that, last year, the grant was reauthorized and increased by the Trump administration.

Why it matters that the NIH canceled a coronavirus research grant

Daszak had been spending about $100,000 a year collaborating with the Wuhan lab.

Peter Daszak: I can't just show up in China and say, ""Hi, I wanna work on your viruses."" I have to do this through the correct channels. So, what we do is we talk to NIH, and they approve the people we can work with in China. And that happened. And our collaboration with Wuhan was preapproved by NIH.

Scott Pelley: What is the theory of the work that you've done with the Wuhan lab?

Peter Daszak: Well, the idea is that we know that viruses that affect people and pandemics tend to come from wildlife. So, our strategy is to go to the wildlife source, find out where the viruses are, and try and shift behaviors like hunting and killing wildlife that would lead to the next outbreak. We also get the information into vaccine and drug developers so they can design better drugs.

The Wuhan Institute is internationally respected. Two years ago, a team from the U.S. Embassy visited. That team sent a cable to Washington, concerned that one lab in the complex had a serious shortage of trained investigators. But the cable, first reported by the Washington Post, emphasized the Wuhan Institute is ""critical to future… outbreak prediction and prevention."" EcoHealth's work with Wuhan ended one week after Mr. Trump's briefing room pledge, when the NIH revoked the grant.

Scott Pelley: They gave you no reason?

Peter Daszak: They said it was canceled for convenience and it doesn't fit within the scope of NIH's priorities right now.

Scott Pelley: And yet it was a high priority when the grant was reissued in 2019?

Peter Daszak: Yeah it's definitely puzzling. I mean, this grant received an incredibly high-priority score. It was in the top 3% of grants they reviewed. And that's unusual.

Maureen Miller

Maureen Miller: I was shocked. I was really, really surprised.

Maureen Miller is a Ph.D. epidemiologist at Columbia University who has collaborated with EcoHealth and Wuhan.

Maureen Miller: It stops the research that's essential to understanding where pandemics like the one we're going through, where they start.

Scott Pelley: How often are NIH grants terminated in this way?

Maureen Miller: This is the first one I've ever heard of. When they terminate an NIH grant, and it's not something that's usually taken lightly, it is for cause. There's fraud involved at some level. There is either manipulation of the data, you're putting your participants in harm's way, or your data are fraudulent.

Scott Pelley: And none of those things have been alleged with EcoHealth?

Maureen Miller: Absolutely not. None.

The National Institutes of Health, in its mission statement, says it exemplifies ""the highest level of scientific integrity and public accountability."" But it wouldn't tell us why the grant was cancelled or whether anything like it had happened before. The NIH told us to direct questions about the origin of the virus to the director of national intelligence.

The Chinese Communist Party has also blocked the truth. In the earliest days, the doctor in Wuhan who discovered the outbreak was silenced by local officials. He later died of COVID-19. In February, the Chinese did allow a visit by an international team of experts including American scientists.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo speaks as President Donald Trump listens during a news briefing at the White House on the coronavirus outbreak, March 20, 2020, in Washington, DC. Getty

President Trump at State of the Union on 2/4/20: We are coordinating with the Chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in China.

Initially, President Trump praised China. But in the following weeks, testing in the U.S. failed to catch up to the need, vital equipment was short, bodies filled refrigerated trailers, and science was continuously challenged.

President Trump at 4/23/20 briefing: Then I see disinfectant, where it knocks it out in a minute, one minute, and is there a way we can do something like that by injection?

As the U.S. led the world in illness and death, the White House moved the focus to the Chinese government.

Last Sunday, Secretary of State Mike Pomepo attempted to resurrect a debunked theory that the virus was man-made in China.

Mike Pompeo on ABC's ""This Week"": Look, the best experts so far seem to think it was man-made. I have no reason to disbelieve that at this point.

He did have reason. Days before, the director of national intelligence said there was ""wide scientific consensus"" the virus was not man-made.

Martha Raddatz on ABC's ""This Week"": Your Office of the DNI says the consensus, the scientific consensus was not man-made or genetically modified.

Mike Pompeo on ABC's ""This Week"": That's right. I agree with that.

The same day Pompeo tried to have it both ways, President Trump repeated the theory of a Chinese lab accident.

President Trump at Fox News town hall: I think they made a horrible mistake and they didn't want to admit it.

Elodie Ghedin

The administration has offered no evidence of an accident or genetic engineering. Dr. Elodie Ghedin is studying the genome of the virus in her lab at New York University.

Elodie Ghedin: People have been saying that's an engineered virus. And it's not. And we know that by looking at the genetic information, looking at the code. And the code tells you a lot.

Human-engineered viruses have common and obvious genetic components, including the virus's overall molecular structure called its backbone.

Elodie Ghedin: If a virus had been engineered, it would've used the backbones that we know. And there's none of that in that virus. And let's say it was a brand-new backbone. Well, it wouldn't look like what it's looking like, because we can find every piece of that virus. We can find these pieces in other very similar viruses that circulate in the wild. From the genetic information, it's clearly not an engineered virus.

Elodie Ghedin and most experts believe the virus, officially called SARS-CoV-2, passed from a wild animal into humans, perhaps in the wild animal market in Wuhan. Many early cases were traced to this market and a market like it was where the SARS virus jumped into a human in 2003.

Elodie Ghedin: A lot of these coronaviruses are found in bats. But we haven't found the exact match. We did find a close match in pangolins. It's an anteater. It's a wildlife that's been traded. People, you know, will consume its meat. But they also use in Chinese medicine, its scales.

Scott Pelley: Is there a way to know that this virus, SARS-CoV-2 emerged from the wild into the human population? Or has that not been proven yet?

Peter Daszak: Well, I'm a scientist. And what I do is I look at the evidence around a hypothesis. There is a huge amount of evidence that these viruses repeatedly emerge into people from wild animals in rural areas through things like hunting and eating wildlife. There is zero evidence that this virus came out of a lab in China.

Scott Pelley: Does the Wuhan Institute of Virology, to your knowledge, have this virus in its inventory?

Peter Daszak: No.

Scott Pelley: Why do you say so?

Peter Daszak: The closest known relative is one that's different enough that it is not SARS-CoV-2. So, there's just no evidence that anybody had it in the lab anywhere in the world prior to the outbreak.

Matt Gaetz on ""Tucker Carlson Tonight"": I have called on Secretary Azar to immediately halt this grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology. They have not been honest and at worst, negligent to the point of many, many deaths throughout the world.

Matt Gaetz wears a gas mask on the floor of the House in early March

Dishonest and negligent allegations have now ended EcoHealth's carefully reviewed research designed to stop pandemics. Representative Matt Gaetz wore a gas mask on the floor of the House to lampoon the crisis. This was back in the beginning of March, weeks before masks were common. Peter Daszak, whose researchers wear masks to shield them from viruses in the wild, says his team is now facing layoffs.

Peter Daszak: This politicization of science is really damaging. You know, the conspiracy theories out there have essentially closed down communication between scientists in China and scientists in the U.S. We need that communication in an outbreak to learn from them how they control it so we can control it better. It's sad to say, but it will probably cost lives. By sort of narrow-mindedly focusing in on ourselves, or on labs, or on certain cultural politics, we miss the real enemy.

It turns out Pelley had previously reported on Daszak and was familiar with his research into how coronaviruses—such as the one causing COVID-19—move from bats to humans.

But this time, Daszak's story took an unexpected turn. Shortly after Pelley finished interviewing him last month about COVID-19's origin, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) abruptly canceled a five-year, $3.7 million grant supporting his research. Pelley and Velie had a new story to report and returned to Daszak for a second interview.

Several U.S. officials, including Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz, had raised suspicions about the Wuhan Institute of Virology, one of Daszak's key collaborators in China. When a reporter mischaracterized key details of the NIH grant during a White House press conference last month, President Trump said he would check if any U.S. funds had been granted to the Wuhan Institute, and if so, he said, they would immediately be terminated.

But the $3.7 million grant was not given to the Wuhan Institute. It had been awarded to Daszak's New York-based organization, EcoHealth Alliance. A week after President Trump said the funds would be terminated in China, the NIH took action against EcoHealth Alliance, giving the organization no reason for the grant's termination. Ending an NIH grant usually requires a full investigation and proof of an egregious action like scientific or financial fraud—neither of which applied to EcoHealth Alliance.

Fellow scientists have spoken out about the unsettling precedent the NIH set. ""This is cutting off your face to spite your nose,"" Gerald Keusch, a former director of NIH's Fogarty International Center, told Science. ""This is the worst kind of thing that political interference can cause in a democracy.""

Recognizing the ramifications of NIH's decision involves understanding of the scope of Daszak's work—and its impact on future coronavirus pandemics.

Pelley and 60 Minutes first met Daszak for a 2004 report. At the time, scientists were still trying to determine the origin of the coronavirus that had caused a global outbreak of SARS, and ecologists like Daszak were among the virus hunters on the case.

For this earlier report, Pelley traveled to Malaysia, where Daszak and a colleague were trying to find the source of another deadly virus, Nipah, which had killed 40 percent of the people it infected. The ecologists eventually traced the virus to bats, which ate the fruit from trees farmers had planted over their pigsties for shade. Pigs then ate bits of tainted fruit the bats had dropped near them.

But even as he was trying to figure out how Malaysian pig farmers had contracted Nipah, Daszak had his eye on future outbreaks.

""What worries me the most is that we are going to miss the next emerging disease,"" Daszak told Pelley at the time, ""that we're suddenly going to find a SARS virus that moves from one part of the planet to another, wiping out people as it moves along.""

From the archives: Hunting viruses

As part of his efforts to predict and prevent future pandemics, Daszak subsequently became president of EcoHealth Alliance, which researches where pandemics come from and how to stop them. Much of his work involves bats, which have become breeding grounds for deadly viruses.

As Daszak explained to 60 Minutes, no one knows for sure why bats are such adept hosts for disease, but one theory is that bats are the only mammal naturally capable of sustained flight. Flying, Daszak explains, burns a lot of oxygen and puts a lot of stress on bats' cells. As a result, their immune system kicks in.

""Bats can't live with that sort of immune response all the time, so they dampen down their immune response. That's been shown,"" Daszak said. ""And in dampening down their own immunity, they allow viruses to proliferate. So bats carry a higher amount of virus and a higher diversity of viruses than other mammals.""

Bats, Daszak and a team of international scientists discovered, were the origin of the 2003 SARS outbreak. While scientists do not yet know the origin species of COVID-19, the closest match has been found in a bat coronavirus in China's Yunnan province that shared 96 percent of its genetic material with the virus that's known to cause COVID-19.

As hunting for virus origins shows, partnerships with scientists around the world are key. Daszak's EcoHealth Alliance has worked for years with the Wuhan Institute, and together they've catalogued hundreds of bat viruses, including dozens of previously unknown coronaviruses. The antiviral medication Remdesivir, the only drug so far proven to help patients with COVID-19, was initially tested against the viruses Daszak and his team had discovered under previous funding from the NIH.

Daszak said EcoHealth Alliance had been spending about $100,000 a year collaborating with the Wuhan Institute.



""I can't just show up in China and say, 'Hi, I want to work on your viruses,'"" he said. ""I have to do this through the correct channels. So, what we do is we talk to NIH, and they approve the people we can work with in China. And that happened. And our collaboration with Wuhan was preapproved by NIH.""

Last year, the NIH reauthorized EcoHealth's five-year grant after independent scientists reviewed the application. According to Daszak, EcoHealth's grant received a high-priority score and was in the top three percent of grants the NIH reviewed last year.

The NIH would not tell 60 Minutes why EcoHealth Alliance's grant was canceled or whether anything like it had happened before.

Daszak says the consequence of NIH pulling the $3.7 million grant will be felt for years to come.

""It matters because number one, our work is used in developing vaccines and drugs to save American lives and the lives of people around the world. So that matters a lot,"" Daszak said. ""Number two, if we really want to know where viruses are going to emerge and cause the next pandemic, we need to have scientific collaborations like this. They're our only eyes and ears on the ground in countries that are very difficult, for political reasons, to work in.""

""We are the frontline of preventing the next pandemic,"" he said. ""And we need to get on with our job.""

The company has more than 150 million paid Prime subscribers worldwide, many of whom have come to rely on the delivery service and its essential workers amidst stay-at-home orders around the globe.

This week on 60 Minutes, correspondent Lesley Stahl reports on how Amazon is protecting its workforce during the coronavirus pandemic.

""I think we've been early on the curve to this than most employers, particularly major employers in the U.S.,"" Amazon's head of operations, Dave Clark, told Stahl.

As part of the company's last earnings report, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos pledged at least $4 billion for COVID-related expenses. The company says it has already invested more than $800 million on safety measures.

The safeguards include experimenting with self-administered COVID-19 testing capabilities, mandating temperature checks, and distributing portable handwashing stations.

The corporation's focus on worker safety comes as some Amazon employees have staged protests, walk-outs, and sick-outs. Their demands include better sanitation of facilities, hazard pay and more generous sick leave.

Amazon says any employee who tests positive for COVID-19 or is presumed positive is eligible to receive up to two weeks of paid time off.

Until May 1, the company had offered unlimited, unpaid time off for its employees who were concerned about their safety during the pandemic. Amazon also increased its current minimum wage from $15 to $17 through May 16.

Jana Jumpp, a 59-year-old Amazon employee who works at a warehouse in Indiana, told 60 Minutes she took advantage of the stay-at-home benefit because she feared for her health.

""I was a little uncomfortable…the cases were starting in Washington and it didn't seem like anybody had a plan, even Amazon,"" Jumpp told 60 Minutes. ""So my only option at that point was to take a leave of absence.""

Jumpp says she began working for Amazon more than four years ago. She has not gone to work in at least two months, taking advantage of the extended unpaid leave policy.

While at home, on her own initiative, Jumpp is tracking the number of Amazon employees who have tested positive for COVID-19 at locations throughout the nation. She gathers her data by connecting with coworkers across the country and collecting the automated text messages and robocalls Amazon sends its employees when someone tests positive at one of its facilities.

An automated text received from Amazon by an employee

""I can tell you right now, and the number is higher than this, but we have at least 600 [cases],"" Jumpp said to Stahl. Jumpp says six Amazon employees have died from COVID-19.

Amazon would not confirm Jumpp's number and says it is not the most important way to quantify the problem. ""The actual…total number of cases isn't particularly useful because it's relative to the size of the building and then the overall community infection rate,"" Clark told 60 Minutes.

Amazon says its automated notification system informs all employees when there is a new confirmed case of COVID-19 at the facility they work at, some of which are the size of multiple football fields. The company does not specify the department or shift the positive employee worked on in these messages. Amazon says it does direct employees who work in proximity of those who have tested positive to enter quarantine, with pay.

Amazon employees who do not meet the stay-at-home criteria now must decide if and when they return to work.

""If there's no reason not to be at work and you choose to stay home...you'd have to use your unpaid time off or [use] your other paid time off options in order to remain at home,"" said Amazon's Dave Clark. ""And if you run out of all those options you would need to come back to work or yes, it would result in separation from [the] company.""

Prior pandemics have played a critical role in molding the way humans live; and the current coronavirus pandemic will be no exception. Jon Wertheim takes a look at some of the possible changes in store on the next edition of 60 Minutes, Sunday, May 17 at 7 p.m. ET/PT on CBS.



The way society is dealing with the pandemic today has its origins in past plagues, says Frank Snowden, a professor emeritus of history at Yale and author of ""Epidemics and Society: From the Black Death to the Present.""



""They had quarantine. They had social distancing… lockdowns,"" Snowden tells Wertheim. ""Doctors actually wore PPE. And what they had was a mask. We know about that. Theirs was differently shaped. It had a long beak. And they put sweet-smelling herbs in it to keep the foul odors away.""



The plagues led to modern ways of life, now basic to society, says Snowden. ""They introduced sewer systems, toilets… set housing regulations, paved streets. So the hygiene of modern cities that we see today was built, in large part, on the sanitary measures that grew out of the terrible experience of Asiatic cholera.""



Changes to come from this pandemic may include new health care initiatives to remedy the failure of society to be prepared for the coronavirus and its disproportionate rate of infection and death among the poor. Different places and different ages have experienced the horror of the virus in different ways. An entire generation of students sit in a kind of virtual detention, unsure when and how they will graduate or restart school.



Renowned Indian novelist Arundhati Roy, who wrote a defining account on the COVID-19 crisis, has some analogies. ""Right now it feels as though we have no present? We have a past. And we have a future. And right now we're in some sort of transit lounge,"" she says. ""We should not be trying to stitch them together without thinking about that rupture? I think the most profound thing is the rupture of the idea of touch, the idea of proximity. All these things will become so laden with risk and fear for a long, long time.""



Speaking to Wertheim from Delhi, one of the world's most polluted cities, she describes the blue skies the city's lockdown has brought, on account of fewer emissions. That is encouragement to environmentalist Bill McKibben. ""Flatten another curve. Flatten the carbon curve too… if we did that, then people might look back in 50 years at this time and thank us, instead of curse us,"" he tells Wertheim.



The dominant economic model of society is being tested by the pandemic, says McKibben. ""We've spent the last 75-- 100 years really fixated in our country and increasingly around the world, on economic growth as the reason for all being,"" McKibben says. ""And… at least for a while, that worked out pretty well. A lot of people were pulled out of poverty. But we've begun to sense the limits of that too. That's why the temperature keeps rising,"" he says.



McKibben says it would be foolish to waste this crisis. ""Well, what choice does one have, really, in a crisis but to try and make something useful of it?

46,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/unemployment-coronavirus-job-search-60-minutes-2020-05-03/,CBS News,2020-05-03,['Scott Pelley'],Stories of Americans suddenly jobless from the coronavirus pandemic,https://cbsnews1.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/05/03/6941766d-dd8d-42c1-8285-5db74b0c2770/thumbnail/1200x630/ed8e59a01498ae3daf4deac483a54277/joblessarticle0.jpg,"As May begins, millions of Americans delete another month of calendar events for the job they never expected to lose. They made plans; graduates entering the hottest economy in a generation, entrepreneurs with their dream in sight and workplace veterans tuning their retirement. Thirty million Americans have filed for unemployment in six weeks. The people you're about to meet signed up last month for a Philadelphia online job fair. It was just four hours of local businesses with open positions but 1,300 people waited in chat rooms for a chance. They wonder how fast the economy should open and find themselves in a strange place, with hours on their hands and time running out.

Courtney Clifton: I actually got the information off of the news.

Courtney Clifton logged on and applied for work in a call center, a long drop from the catering company she built on a dream.

Courtney Clifton

Courtney Clifton: Amuse Bouche Cuisine was started in about 2015, right after I graduated culinary school. We started out doing small parties and doing the traditional catering events. Our client list has grown exponentially.

Scott Pelley: And since COVID-19?

Courtney Clifton: Whew. All of a sudden, my clients were calling and emailing. ""We have to cancel. We have to postpone."" We started losing events (SNAPS FINGERS) like that.

Scott Pelley: And what happened to your business?

Courtney Clifton: We went from six employees to two. And now we have none.

Her husband is still working in home health care. Courtney applied for a government emergency loan, but that hasn't come through. The largest bailout in history has lurched forward. The small business administration's paycheck protection bailout was partly cleaned out by big business. Government websites have been overwhelmed.

Courtney Clifton: The last time I checked, it was in red at the top of the page. And it said, ""We are unable to offer any information at this time. Please check back later.""

Scott Pelley: But there is no later for your employees.

Courtney Clifton: Unfortunately, not. I had tears in my eyes when I had to tell my right-hand woman, who is also a family member, that her only source of income-- I-- I-- there was nothing that I could do.

Scott Pelley: Have you been able to get unemployment?

Courtney Clifton: I have applied. But I haven't received a response yet.

State unemployment offices are jammed. Nationwide, in March, only 14% of new applicants had received their first check, according to the public policy research group, the Century Foundation.

Scott Pelley: What about your stimulus check? You should have $1,200 coming from the government.

Courtney Clifton: Yeah, that's something that I was definitely looking forward to. And my husband actually has an app that allows you to see your mail that's coming to you. So, I've seen a picture of the envelope that has the check. But I actually haven't received it yet in the mail.

Scott Pelley: How long before you're broke?

Courtney Clifton: Now.

Tim Yabor also heard about last month's job fair on the news.

Tim Yabor

Tim Yabor: My boss said, ""Do you have a couple minutes to talk on Zoom?"" And that's when it happened.

In those 'couple of minutes on Zoom,' Yabor, 55, was laid off after decades in sales for hotels and, then, a convention center.

Scott Pelley: When was the last time you were unemployed?

Tim Yabor: I was never unemployed. This is the first time.

Yabor's wife still has a job in insurance. And she's working from home.

Scott Pelley: What keeps you up at night?

Tim Yabor: That my kids will ask me for money that, before, I would just give them money. I worry that we can make our mortgage, that we can have food. And, you know, pay our bills.

Scott Pelley: Have you thought of going to the food bank?

Tim Yabor: Thought and did. I passed by a food bank. I wasn't as bad as the people that were standing in line. They needed it more than I did.

This was the need in Philadelphia on Thursday. For the pandemic, the city helped set up 40 food lines, open every Monday and Thursday. 32,000 boxes of groceries a week. Some of those in line these days are the kind of workers Robin Barbacane has helped in her long career.

Robin Barbacane

Robin Barbacane: I'm a human resources executive. So, I've coached hundreds of people, maybe thousands of people, through the process.

Scott Pelley: What is your advice?

Robin Barbacane: Typically what I tell them, the first thing, is to, you know, realize that you have to look at this as a full-time job and you have to work at it every single day.

Scott Pelley: Have you been able to take your own advice?

Robin Barbacane: I've tried. There are good days and there are bad days.

The bad days started with her layoff in March. She applied at the online job fair for the kind of positions she held a decade ago.

Scott Pelley: What does a bad day look like?

Robin Barbacane: Well, I'm a mom. So, a bad day can't really be a bad day. You have to-- you know, you have to kinda be the rock to hold the family together. You have to hold everything together for your kids. So, there's not a lotta time to take a moment.

Her family would feel more confident, she told us, if politicians showed more leadership and less partisan bickering.

Robin Barbacane: The kids are watching. And, you know, they're watching the adults lose their minds and go crazy and fight over ridiculous things. And it's awful. It's really hard to try to think that, you know, ""What's the future gonna be for our kids?""

And will that future be undermined, she wonders, if the economy doesn't open and soon.

Robin Barbacane: Definitely, we have to balance public safety and health. But at the same token, we have to look at what's gonna happen to our economy. And, you know, are we gonna completely cripple our society from being in financial ruin? I think that's really, really scary, to be part of that and be caught up in that, and worry about what's gonna happen to your family.

Many families were anticipating graduation season, sending sons and daughters into the best economy in a generation. Reid Henzel graduated in December with a job in hand, which vanished.

Reid Henzel

Scott Pelley: Are you back with your parents?

Reid Henzel: So I'm actually living with my girlfriend's parents right now and with her and her family.

Scott Pelley: What's it like living there?

Reid Henzel: I've been trying to work around the house, help as much as I possibly can so I'm avoiding that freeloading.

Nearly 4 million students are due to graduate this spring — into an economy that shrank at a rate of nearly 5% in the first quarter — the worst since the great recession.

Reid Henzel: Everyday it's going on to LinkedIn or Indeed or Glassdoor. Reaching out, having a cover letter ready, a resume already made up.

Scott Pelley: How many have you applied for?

Reid Henzel: Around 25 or so.

Scott Pelley: And you have answers from how many?

Reid Henzel: Zero.

Wall Street and government economists estimate the economy will shrink, in the second quarter, at a rate near 40%, rivaling the great depression.

Erin McCahill: Sometimes you get up and you have, you know, three, four, sometimes seven or eight, ""We're not going to move forward with you in this position. We have someone else who's more qualified.""

Erin McCahill

Erin McCahill was director of sales for a major telecom. She's back in the job market after running her own consulting shop. She took a shot at Philadelphia's online job fair.

Erin McCahill: Each company that was part of the job fair had a window, a room, what they called it. So you could go into the room, see what jobs they had open, and decide to get in line. Once you got connected with a recruiter, you had about four minutes to tell them who you were, what you were looking for, and learn a little bit about their company.

Scott Pelley: They gave you a time limit?

Erin McCahill: Yes. And you could see the clock counting down.

Her goal is ten applications a day.

Erin McCahill: Some positions that I've applied for, they question why I'm applying for the job.

Scott Pelley: Because?

Erin McCahill: I'm overqualified for that position.

Scott Pelley: You would take those jobs?

Erin McCahill: Yes. I have to do what I have to do right now.

Especially since neither unemployment insurance nor the stimulus check have come through.

Scott Pelley: We were told that help was on the way.

Erin McCahill: I haven't gotten it yet.

The U.S. Treasury says about 80% of households have been issued stimulus checks including the home of Saleena Temple who had been a paralegal in law offices for 20 years.

Saleena Temple

Saleena Temple: I got a telephone call from the office manager. She said that the office would be closing indefinitely. And that basically was it. Two weeks after that, I received a letter that my health insurance would be terminated at the end of March.

Scott Pelley: Do you have any health issues?

Saleena Temple: I do, yes. Yes. I have suffered with low iron for a long time. And it caused damage to my heart. And I actually was in the hospital in November.

Nearly 13 million Americans likely lost their health insurance with their jobs according to research by the Economic Policy Institute.

Saleena Temple: I cannot get the medicine because I don't have health insurance. I can't follow up with my primary doctor because I can't pay for a visit.

Despite heart trouble she was working full time and studying. She's three classes away from an MBA. Her son is graduating too, but tuition bills have left her with loans to pay.

Scott Pelley: What do your student debts come to?

Saleena Temple: They are somewhere in the neighborhood of $300,000, that includes my son's education as well.

Scott Pelley: How are you gonna make those payments?

Saleena Temple: I have no idea. It actually terrifies me. I try not to focus on that because the thought process can be really dark during those times.

Scott Pelley: You're the first person in your family to graduate college. And now your son and daughter have gone on to higher education. How does the American dream feel to you?

Saleena Temple: It doesn't feel like a dream at all.

Courtney Clifton: I used to go to the grocery store maybe once a week. And I would spend anywhere between $100 to $150 during my trip. Now it's-- it's a challenge because I spend about $20, $25 a week as opposed to $100, $150. And I make it work.

Courtney Clifton, the catering company owner, hasn't heard back on that call center job. Like the others who spoke with us, she longs to know what her new world will look like and when she will see it.

Courtney Clifton: I thank God that my husband has a job that will allow us to at least pay our rent. But that's it. My business was my sole income.

Scott Pelley: How do you imagine your catering business coming back?

Courtney Clifton: I'm not sure because not only am I gonna have to wait until they open up the state, which is this, you know, so many steps plan. Once they open the state, then I have to wait for people to feel comfortable enough to start going out in public again. And then I have to wait until people are comfortable enough to start planning events with people gathering together. And the only thing keeping me going, my husband and my faith in God.

To understand who would benefit from this new bailout, we took a close look at another recent bailout for farmers: the $28 billion program, administered without congressional oversight over the last two years and meant to offset damages from President Trump's trade war with China. We wanted to know, where did the money go?

As it turns out, most of it bypassed the country's traditional small and medium-sized farms that were battered by the loss of their export market and which are now being hit with severe losses from the coronavirus pandemic.



South Dakota is soybean, corn and wheat country, and right now it's reeling.

A farm in South Dakota

Bob Kuylen: If people are-- are really wanting to jump off a building about what the stock market is doing, we've been doing that for three years now. We did everything right. We raised great crops. But we're still losing our rear ends because, uh, because of what's happening with-- with—the sanctions. And now with the Coronavirus, it's gonna be another hit, without a doubt.



Doug Sombke: So imagine three years ago, you lost 30% of your paycheck and then the next year, you lost another 30%. I mean, that's the pain we're feeling.



Doug Sombke and Bob Kuylen oversee the farmers unions in North and South Dakota with more than 50,000 farmers and livestock producers. The average farm here is less than 1,500 acres.



We interviewed them remotely.



Lesley Stahl: What is happening to your farmers with this virus?



Doug Sombke: It's just accelerating the problem. And we are, um, not being able to sell because everyone's worried if the plants are gonna stay open.



Lesley Stahl: And restaurants closing and…



Doug Sombke: Yeah, yeah. The food is starting to back up. Uh, the freezers are getting full. Restaurants aren't buying. So yeah, it's really becoming a huge issue for us.

With restaurants and schools closed across the country, their markets are shrinking. It's adding to already rising debt and farm bankruptcies aggravated by the trade war with China. They told us the bailout, called the Market Facilitation Program that began in 2018, helped them survive the last two years but didn't come close to covering most of their members' losses or their own.



Lesley Stahl: How did the tariffs, the sanctions affect you?



Bob Kuylen: About $70,000 a year I lost in the last couple of years.



Doug Sombke: On our farm, we've lost-- in the last, uh, three years, roughly $125,000 to $200,000 a year.



Lesley Stahl: But what about the bailouts? You had two rounds. This was supposed to tide you over.



Doug Sombke: Yeah.



Lesley Stahl: Did it?



Doug Sombke: Well, it made the banker happy. It didn't do anything for me.

Bob Kuylen and Doug Sombke

Lesley Stahl: We've seen reports of suicides going up among farmers.



Bob Kuylen: Oh, yeah. I know personally families that are suffering through that. The-- the stresses out there now, it's just-- they're out there for four or five generations of their family and they're the ones that lost the farm? What do you think that's gonna do to their-- their mind?



Doug Sombke: Yeah a lot of depression. And, just this past year in my hometown, we've-- we've lost three young men to suicide. It's-- it's just hard, Lesley, because you see these young guys coming up and, you know, and-- and you've coached them in baseball. You-- you-- you have had hopes that-- you're glad they stayed in the community and then you end up seeing this happen. And, none of their fault. Not any of their fault. And it's hard. And I worry about my kids. My-- my sons are on the farm and I worry about them all the time.

After President Trump imposed the stringent tariffs in 2018, China struck back hard here in the Farm Belt -- imposing its own steep tariffs, especially impacting soybeans, our largest agricultural export to China, and sending commodity prices into a freefall. The administration tapped a Depression-era fund for agriculture and provided $28 billion for farmers, almost $3 billion to purchase surpluses for food banks and other nutrition programs and more than $24 billion in direct aid to farmers.



President Trump: ""We will ensure the farmers get the relief they need. And very, very quickly. It's a good time to be a farmer, we're going to make sure of that.""



But so far, most of the money has gone to the biggest farms - one-third of it to just 4% of them. Even farm owners who personally report nearly $1 million in income per year are eligible.

We spoke to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue in March, in the early days of the pandemic before social distancing was the norm. He defended the trade war bailout and the payments to farmers that were based on the amount of crops produced in 2018; and by planted acreage in 2019.

Sonny Perdue: It's not a welfare program. It's not a subsidy. It's not a price-support system. It is a market-damage system. A disruption there.



Lesley Stahl: These payments are disproportionately going to the big, wealthy farms at the expense of the smaller farms where the suffering is.



Sonny Perdue: The fact is, Lesley, most of our production in America is done by large farmers. That's just the way it happens. These are-- these are awards based on the production. And-- but we did try. We've got payment limits that cut people off.

Sen. Grassley: I tried to limit farm subsidy recipients

But the payment limits don't always cut people off. The limit, or the cap, designed specifically for the biggest operators, used to be $125,000 per person or legal entity. But that was raised last year to $250,000.



Lesley Stahl: But why did you double the cap? The limit?



Sonny Perdue: We saw the amount of trade damage that was happening here. The need was out there in order to keep these farmers where they could continue. Not be made whole, but to continue to survive to farm again the next year.



Ken Cook: They made changes for the very largest farmers. If you're a small farmer, you don't have to worry about the limits. You're gonna not come close to hitting them. But large farmers, they changed it so that a husband could get $250,000. His wife could get $250,000.



Ken cook is the president of the Environmental Working Group that's been tracking farm subsidies for decades and now the direct payments to farmers under the Trump administration's bailout.



The USDA data Cook obtained through a search of public records show farms are actually collecting millions of dollars – way over the cap. They do it by exploiting permissive eligibility rules that the administration adopted from Congress' farm bills. Those rules allow big farms to collect maximum payments on behalf of not just the farmer, but many others.



Ken Cook: Cousins, uncles, aunts.



Lesley Stahl: So let's say I have a cousin who's a farmer. And I'm a reporter in New York. I sit here. I don't do any farming. But I'm a cousin.



Ken Cook: That's right.



Lesley Stahl: I can get money?



Ken Cook: You can get money. Maybe you have to make a phone call a couple times a year to find out what--



Lesley Stahl: But I don't have to even go there?



Ken Cook: No, you don't have to live on the farm or visit the farm. These payments aren't just going to farmers who are out there climbing up on a tractor every morning. These payments are going to people who are living in the middle of New York City because they happen to have an ownership interest in the farm.

Ken Cook

Many farms today have investors - call them absentee owners - who also collect bailout money. When we checked, we found hundreds of recipients living in big cities including New York City, Miami, San Francisco. Among them, a banker, an architect, a composer, a classical musician.

Not South Dakota's Doug Sombke's idea of a farmer.



Doug Sombke: I mean, my sons are the ones out here working. They're the ones that should get the money. If you've got dirt under your fingernails, you're the ones that should be getting the money, nobody else.



Lesley Stahl: But doesn't the money come to the farm?



Doug Sombke: No, it can go anywhere. They can distribute it as the corporation sees fit, right?



Ken Cook: If you're a very large farm operation and you're eligible for these payments, the most important tool as a farmer is not what's in your machine shed. It's the lawyer you hire to set up a paper farm that's designed to absorb as much federal money, as much Trump payment, as possible.



Lesley Stahl: And there are lawyers who are documenting these family owners?



Ken Cook: There are lawyers who specialize in helping big farms maximize their payments from the Department of Agriculture. It's an industry in and of itself. And they do very well.



Lawyers like Robert Serio who for years have been making the most of the loopholes in farm subsidy policy - and now the Trump administration's bailout.



Lesley Stahl: Do you know the nickname that you have?



Robert Serio: Uh, not really.



Lesley Stahl: It's Loophole. They call you Loophole.



Robert Serio: Somebody else called me the Cap Doctor.



Lesley Stahl: Oh, the Cap Doctor?



Robert Serio: The Cap Doctor.

Robert Serio

Serio is based here in Clarendon, Arkansas, a tiny town with one sit down restaurant where he knows everybody.



He has more than 250 clients in 25 states that he says are all actively engaged in farming. Serio represents the deline farming operations. They include three partnerships that usda data show are registered to the same address in Missouri, which in total collected more than $5 million in the bailout so far – way more than the cap.



Robert Serio: These are not loopholes. They are designed regulations. All I did was follow a trail that the government laid out for me.



Lesley Stahl: Well, no one is saying it's illegal. Nobody.



Robert Serio: No.



Lesley Stahl: If that farm is a partnership, how much can they get if there are 20 people in the partnership? Do they still only get $250,000?



Robert Serio: No, ma'am.



Lesley Stahl: They get $250,000 times 20, right?



Robert Serio: If, if they earn it. If that land that they're farming earns that money.



Lesley Stahl: Let's say it earned the money, but there's only one person. And he, they then get…



Robert Serio: I would say to that one person he needs to come and see me. Because he's not running a very economical farming operation.



Lesley Stahl: So I've come to you. What are you-- what do you do? What do you advise me to do?



Robert Serio: First thing I would do, ask you if you were married. And if your answer is yes, I would say, ""Then you need to form a husband and wife partnership."" That would be my first advice. Secondly, if you're even bigger than that, I might ask you, ""Do you have any children who are working' on the farm?""

And if that answer is yes, then I would tell them how to be able to use that child to enhance that-- the cash flow for that partnership I'm going to form. And your farming operation will be-- have more eligibility and en-- enhance your cash flow, make you more profitable. Everybody'll benefit from that.



Lesley Stahl: What's the largest partnership you ever formed?



Robert Serio: 66 partners.



Lesley Stahl: 66.



Robert Serio: Yeah.



Lesley Stahl: That's a lot.

Sonny Perdue

Remember this is taxpayer money. Secretary Perdue said if farmers are exploiting weak subsidy laws to get money they shouldn't, it's Congress' fault.



Sonny Perdue: What I'm telling you, Lesley, is that we use the same criteria as Congress passed in the farm bill to determine who is eligible to receive money and who is not. That-- that's the facts.



Lesley Stahl: Ok.



Sonny Perdue: We-- we are administrators of the law passed by Congress.



Lesley Stahl: But let me ask you, as the secretary of agriculture, if you think that's a good idea. To have those-- allow those partnerships to exist.



Sonny Perdue: I think, again, it really is the responsibility to Congress to determine this. From my perspective as an administrator, my job is to follow the law.

As of Friday, Texas was ranked 9th. But Texas also ranks near the bottom when it comes to the percentage of residents it's tested -- and that worries some doctors and nurses, especially those in rural areas of the state.

Many small hospitals and clinics around the country are fearful they don't have the staff and budget to survive the pandemic.

Among those trying to prop up the system in Texas is Sid Miller, the commissioner of agriculture, who wears many hats. He came to our interview wearing a custom made white one.

Sid Miller

Sid Miller: Well, I'm the commissioner of agriculture. Course we oversee, you know, cows, plows, and sows, but that's-- I'm also the Commissioner of the State Office of Rural Health. So we-- we're-- we're trying to keep 163 rural hospitals open and from, you know, going out of business.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Any sense of how many hospitals-- rural hospitals are at risk right now in Texas?

Sid Miller: Well, of the 163 we have, 60 of 'em have less than 30 days' cash on hand.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Whoa.

Sid Miller: Yeah, some of them-- actually, we had one filing for bankruptcy this week.

Sharyn Alfonsi: A hospital?

Sid Miller: In Alpine, Texas, and the parent company are filing for bankruptcy. So we've already--

Sharyn Alfonsi: Did this push them over the edge, the COVID?

Sid Miller: Yes, it-- it pushed them over the edge. And I'm-- I'm afraid this pandemic-- we're gonna-- we're gonna continue to lose health care providers in rural Texas and across the nation.

Low reimbursement rates and high numbers of uninsured patients have forced 128 hospitals that served 6 million people across the nation to close in the last decade. Twenty-one hospitals were in Texas, more than any other state.

That's left one out of five rural Texas counties without a doctor.

Elizabeth Ellis is a nurse practitioner.

When we met her she was tearing around her East Texas farm with her four-legged sidearm named Pistol.

The clinic she owns is in Bedias, Texas. Population 443. Lately, her job includes administering COVID-19 tests in the clinic parking lot.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Has coronavirus reached out here?

Elizabeth Ellis: Yes, it has reached Grimes County.

Sharyn Alfonsi: That's shocking. You know, driving through here I definitely saw more cows than people.

Elizabeth Ellis: A lot of our community members have to leave the county for jobs. That puts them at risk. So it was inevitable that at some point in time it was gonna hit the county.

Elizabeth Ellis

So far, Grimes County has reported 19 COVID cases and one death. The county is about an hour and a half northwest of Houston. 400,000 acres of it are covered with farms and ranches. Social distancing is built into the landscape and enforced by barbed wire.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Tell me what the challenge is of providing health care in a rural community like this.

Elizabeth Ellis: We have larger elderly population. And they have sometimes ten, sometimes 12, even 20 chronic disease states and comorbid conditions. They're poor, predominantly on Medicaid. I have a tremendous agricultural group of farmers and families that are in the gap. They can't afford insurance.

Sharyn Alfonsi: When you say ""in the gap,"" what do you mean by that?

Elizabeth Ellis: They are not quite poor enough to be on Medicaid and they don't make enough money to yet afford insurance.

Sharyn Alfonsi: So as we're talking about coronavirus, we know the elderly are at higher risk. We know people with preexisting conditions are at higher risk. And that's this community.

Elizabeth Ellis: It is this community.

Now, many of those patients are too afraid to go to the clinic, others simply can't get there.

Elizabeth Ellis: For many of these people, transportation is a liability. They don't have it or they can't dri--, they're elderly, they have conditions and they can't drive.

Increasingly, Ellis's rounds require a full tank of gas. She negotiates dusty roads.

To check up on patients at their homes.

Coronavirus in rural Texas: The high cost of low technology

Sharyn Alfonsi: So if you get a bunch of coronavirus cases, if there's some kind of community spread here, what happens? What do you do?

Elizabeth Ellis: I'm gonna be overwhelmed. And what frightens me is that all of America's critical access hospitals, especially here in Texas, are at risk of closing.

Critical access hospitals are the health care outposts many rural communities rely on. The drive to an emergency room can take an hour or more.

Dr. Leighann Falcon: I take care of people I went to school with, their parents. I take care of former teachers. They may go to the same school as my kids. They may go to my gym, and so we just, we-- we know everyone.

Dr. Leighann Falcon is one of 10 full-time doctors at Memorial Medical Center in Calhoun County. It serves 26,000 people on the Gulf Coast of Texas.

Dr. Falcon also runs a clinic just down the street.

Sharyn Alfonsi: You hear about rural health care in Texas and it being such a dire situation here, and hospitals closing and doctors leaving. Why? Why is it so bad in Texas?

Dr. Leighann Falcon: We lead the nation in a lotta things, including uninsured. So about 9% of people are uninsured across the country, give or take, and in Texas, it's more than double that. Our little hospital down the street on any given year can provide up to $6 million in uncompensated care. And it's hard to run a business when you're giving away $6 million a year.

Dr. Leighann Falcon

And this year, the pandemic has pushed Calhoun County's hospital further into the red. Like many states, preparing for the pandemic, Texas cancelled non-essential medical procedures for 30 days to expand hospital capacity around the state. Things like colonoscopies and lab services that usually make up half the revenue at the state's rural hospitals.

When we visited Calhoun County's hospital, there were no COVID patients, but few other patients either. We noticed the ER was silent and most beds were empty, partly because fear of the virus is discouraging people from going to the ER.

An administrator told us they were down to seven days worth of cash. Revenue from elective procedures, a primary moneymaker for the hospital, has almost disappeared.

Sharyn Alfonsi: Can, you know, the hospitals, the clinics survive this?

Dr. Leighann Falcon: Without assistance, they won't survive. And if our hospital were to close, it would devastate our community. It would-- it would be horrible.

Sharyn Alfonsi: How so?

Dr. Leighann Falcon: Well, first of all, there's just a lack of care. Again, we're already short physicians. We're short for health care. If you have an emergency, and the nearest emergency room is over 35 miles away, that's not a good thing.

Dr. Falcon, a single mother of three, has started skipping paychecks to pay her staff.

And there's another problem. Doctors and nurses must treat every patient like they may have COVID-19. Now, they're running low on personal protective equipment.

Dr. Leighann Falcon: It's empty.

Sharyn Alfonsi: It's empty.

Dr. Leighann Falcon: Yeah, and I never thought I would see that.

A nurse told us they are reusing masks and mixing their own cleaning supplies. The number of COVID-19 cases is still rising in their county. Last week, it was up to 30. And preparing for the possibility of more is further draining the budget.

Dr. Leighann Falcon: Our hospital is financially struggling on a good day. So now this normal equipment which we probably pay, what, a dollar for, 50 cents for, and now we are paying 20 times that. It's just crazy.

Dr. Leighann Falcon takes correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi's temperature

Sharyn Alfonsi: Are you? Have prices gone up that much?

Erin Clevenger, RN: Yeah, so usually, the masks like we're wearing, these are-- like Dr. Falcon's wearing…we pay about 6 cents each normally, we are paying up to $1.20 each now.

Lately, Sid Miller, the agriculture commissioner who oversees a $680 million state budget, has taken to delivering hand sanitizer in the back of his truck. Loading it up in Austin, driving it to the country.

Sharyn Alfonsi: I think a lot of people think because some areas of Texas are so rural and so remote that COVID won't affect them, won't bother them. There's natural social distancing.

Sid Miller: Well, you know, that's simply not true. The single hottest spot in the United States is in South Dakota, of all places. You know, had a beef packing plant up there. Well, I think the last count I saw was, like, 650 cases in that one town where those-- you know, areas of South Dakota. So that-- that-- that dog won't hunt. It just doesn't hold true

After we spoke to Miller, a similar hotspot surfaced nearly nine hours from Austin, at a meatpacking plant in a city called Cactus in the Texas panhandle.

More than 350 people have tested positive and three died in surrounding Moore County, which now has the highest COVID infection rate in the state.

The sole 25-bed hospital in the county only had two ventilators. The CEO of the hospital used his four-seater plane to pick up two more ventilators and the state supplied another three.

Sid Miller: The one thing that-- that's limited on these-- rural hospitals is ventilators. Some of 'em may have one. Some of 'em may have two. We've had to go back in and dig out those that are in storage, you know, and refurbish 'em and get them ready. So, we still don't quite have a handle on the ventilators in these rural hospitals.

In March, he asked the Texas governor for $40 million to prop up rural health care centers during the pandemic, arguing if the hospitals fail, the communities will too.

Sid Miller: When a hospital closes up, the manufacturing leaves too because they have to have health care. You have-- you have to have three things. You have to have a financial institution, you have to have health care, and you have to have church. If you don't have any of those three, the community starts to dry up.

On Monday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott announced he was allowing his stay at home order to expire and some Texas businesses to reopen.



Greg Abbott: That executive order has done its job to slow the growth of COVID-19.

Three days later, Texas had its single highest number of COVID deaths in a day with 50. Abbott is now prioritizing testing in rural communities. But he has not publicly said whether he'll grant any additional funding to rural clinics and declined our requests for an interview.

Dr. Leighann Falcon: Being younger and naïve, I guess I just never realized during times like this when something would happen, how much we would really have to rely on ourselves and kinda cowboy up and do things on our own.

In March, Congress approved $100 billion for hospitals and in April, President Trump signed a relief package that promised another $75 billion.

But so far, the hospital in Calhoun County, Texas, has received about $600,000 of aid, which they say will cover three weeks payroll. And nurse practitioner Elizabeth Ellis has received a total of $800.

On Friday afternoon, the Trump administration promised to rush $10 billion specifically for rural health care providers. Nurse Ellis told us she'll believe it when she sees it.

Elizabeth Ellis: Right now, you know, I'm-- I'm losin' $10,000 plus--

Sharyn Alfonsi: $10,000 a month?

Elizabeth Ellis: Yes this is my retirement. I'm using my retirement,

Sharyn Alfonsi: No one would blame you if you said, ""I've had enough. I can't keep diggin' into my retirement."" Why don't you?

Elizabeth Ellis: Because I believe in what we are doing with my heart. We will do our best to maintain. But it won't last for very long. I'm-- I'm at risk every day right now of having to make that difficult decision.

The ""big two"" – General Motors and Ford – built nearly 4 million vehicles here in America last year, today they are making exactly zero; their factories closed to prevent the coronavirus from spreading among employees.

While they are no longer making cars, both GM and Ford are applying their manufacturing muscle to the pandemic by turning out ventilators and personal protective equipment in huge numbers. Last week we spoke to GM CEO Mary Barra and Ford executive chairman Bill Ford remotely, both of them were in Michigan, and they told us they're thinking creatively to figure out how to get their workers back on the line and keep them there.

Bill Ford: We're shut down pretty much everywhere in the world except China right now. And then, of course, we were shut down in China earlier. And we've never had a time like this where everything has been shut.



Norah O'Donnell: I know that Ford reports its first quarter earnings in a few days and the projection is a loss of $2 billion. And those losses will continue to mount. Can you sustain that?

Bill Ford: Well, obviously, not indefinitely.

Between them, Ford and General Motors had nearly $300 billion in revenue last year. Today, that river of money is running dry.

Mary Barra is CEO of GM, the first woman to run the company in its history.

Norah O'Donnell: Has COVID-19 proved to be an existential threat to GM's long-term health?

Mary Barra: Between the strength of our balance sheet with the steps we've taken in the past, we will get through this and we will learn a lot of lessons that we'll apply.

Norah O'Donnell: I mean, what's the long-term prognosis for-- for General Motors if you're not making cars?

Mary Barra: No one knows-- when things are going to get back to what I refer to as a new normal. I've heard others refer to it as the new abnormal.

Mary Barra, CEO of GM

In the ""new abnormal,"" GM and Ford have each tapped into about $15 billion in private lines of credit to pay their bills. One estimate is that Ford is burning through $165 million dollars a day. Remember, it was just 11 years ago, in the last financial crisis, that GM declared bankruptcy. Ford avoided that, but did get a $6 billion government loan.

Norah O'Donnell: So do you think you'll need another loan to get through this crisis?

Bill Ford: We don't think so. We think we can get through this. And we think we can get through it and get back to work. But we're in an unprecedented time. And so I suppose you never say never. But that's not our plan.

Part of the financial pressure is that under their contracts with the United Auto Workers union, Ford and GM continue to pay millions of dollars to their idled workers.

And now there's political pressure, with protests taking place in their home state of Michigan, and some demonstrators demanding an economic restart.

Norah O'Donnell: What do you think's driving those protests?

Bill Ford: I think people are-- are understandably nervous, scared-- scared about the disease, but also scared about their own economic well being. And so I mean I get it. I totally get it.

Norah O'Donnell: Many people in your state want to get back to work soon.

Bill Ford: Well, I think we'd all like to get back to work soon. But we have to do it safely. And that's not a political question. That's really a scientific question.

Bill Ford

As Ford and GM shut down auto production in March, Michigan emerged as a major COVID-19 hot spot. The state has the third largest number of deaths in the nation, and its health care workers have endured shortages of protective gear. The state's largest health system, Beaumont, says that 1,500 of its employees are presumed to have COVID-19.

Norah O'Donnell: What were your marching orders to your team when this crisis began?

Bill Ford: My team didn't need marching orders. Right from the very start, it was from our local hospital saying, ""Hey, we don't have any protective equipment, who can help us,"" our company just jumped into action.

And that began Ford's transformation from carmaker to medical supply manufacturer. The company has since churned out millions of face shields, masks, gowns, and portable respirators for health care workers. This past week, ford began producing ventilators for patients.

Bill Ford: There are companies that can make complicated things, but they make them in small numbers. There are also companies that can make lots of things, but they can't make complicated things. You know, we turn out an F-150 every 52 seconds. So when we look at this crisis-- as a country and said, you know, ""Which industry is positioned to help us not only in terms of sophisticated machinery, but can do a lotta them and a lotta them quickly,"" the auto industry is uniquely positioned to do that.

Ford workers manufacturing medical supplies

In mid-March, it looked as if American hospitals would quickly need thousands of ventilators that didn't exist.

As the pandemic spread, GM's Mary Barra learned about a small innovative ventilator manufacturer in Washington state called Ventec.

Norah O'Donnell: Was putting the company's assets and people to work, to fight this pandemic an easy decision?

Mary Barra: It was a very easy decision. When I got the call and we got the introduction to Ventec the team just moved so quickly. And we thought if there's a way we can help, we absolutely want to do it.

After one phone call with Ventec, Phil Kienle, GM's vice president of North American manufacturing, got on a plane with three of his engineers.

Phil Kienle

Phil Kienle: When we were on the flight to Seattle, I asked everybody to have a mindset of what if your parents, your wife, one of your children had this COVID disease, and absolutely needed one of these ventilators? How far would you go to get this thing into production? How fast would you move?

Norah O'Donnell: And given the speed with which you needed to act, how did you go about sourcing 400 different parts for ventilators?

Phil Kienle: Our global purchasing and supply chain team really pulled off a miracle in sourcing this. We were in Seattle on a Friday. That same weekend, they were already sourcing the components for us.

GM and Ventec began transforming GM's Kokomo, Indiana, facility virtually overnight, from one that made electronic car components to a ventilator factory. It was ideally suited because both products contain a lot of circuit boards.

Then they called on a mixture of salaried GM employees and union workers from the UAW.

George Vandermeir

George Vandermeir has been with GM for 43 years. He used to make sure parts for pickup trucks met safety standards. He's doing the same now for ventilators, with parts so small they need to be picked up with a set of tweezers.

Norah O'Donnell: When were you scheduled to retire?

George Vandermeir: Yesterday. So I just extended my retirement for another month or two just to make sure this gets off the ground and everything works well so we can get these ventilators out.

Tracy Streeter used to move sheet metal with a forklift at his old GM job. That was before he was laid off because of COVID-19.

Tracy Streeter: And just brought that plant to a standstill.

He is one of 46 laid-off workers from a GM plant in Marion, Indiana, who got the call from Kokomo.

Tracy Streeter: I went and asked my wife. She's an LPN. And her eyes lit up and she went, ""You get to help."" So it was a no-brainer.

Norah O'Donnell: Your wife is a nurse and she said, ""This is an opportunity to help.""

Tracy Streeter: Exactly.

Tracy Streeter

In just two days he was trained to assemble and test a part of the ventilator that holds oxygen and has to be airtight.

Tracy Streeter: There's a little tiny screw that goes into-- the part that I build. But even though that screw is so small, it's an important part. I look at it in the scheme of things, I'm just probably just as insignificant as that small little screw. But I play a part in what's happening in the bigger scale.

Phil Kienle: It went from a discussion to production in less than three weeks.

At first, GM and Ventec were operating on their own. In late March, President Trump ordered them to make ventilators under the Defense Production Act. Twelve days later they signed a half-billion dollar contract to make 30,000 for the federal government by August.

GM says it's not making any profit on the ventilators, but the project is teaching the company valuable lessons to help get its car factories open faster, says Phil Kienle, head of manufacturing for North America.

Phil Kienle: Well, we've actually pretty much used-- Kokomo as a beta site, if you will, for new safety protocols that we'll instill when General Motors restarts.

Norah O'Donnell: That's really interesting. So not only are you making ventilators, you're also learning about how to work safely in this new era once you reopen the car plants.

Phil Kienle: Absolutely.

Norah O'Donnell: Many of those working on Kokomo, Mary, told us that they get their temperature taken before they go into work. Is that going to be the new normal in American manufacturing?

Mary Barra: Yes it will be. And before I walked into this facility today I had my temperature scanned. I think it's-- a very important part of the protocol.

Bill Ford: In the plant I'm in today-- we're wearing face masks and we're wearing face shields.

Ford's executive chairman, Bill Ford, says the company has also installed plastic barriers between each workstation to enforce social distancing.

Bill Ford: Everybody's also wearing watches that buzz if you get within six feet of somebody else.

Norah O'Donnell: That's the first I had heard about these wristbands that buzz when you get within six feet of somebody.

Bill Ford: Yeah, we're trying it out.

The watches that Ford is testing are made by Samsung and use bluetooth technology.

Bill Ford: It also tells you who you've come into contact with that's also been wearing that-- that-- wristband, so that if anybody was infected, it's very easy to trace who they were interacting with.

Ford is testing the watches with small teams of workers now making medical equipment.

Norah O'Donnell: And what do you do when it buzzes?

Joanne Ritchie: Back off. (LAUGH)

Joanne Ritchie

30-year Ford employee Joanne Ritchie is on a line that's made over a million face masks. Just six weeks ago, in another ""clean room,"" she was making transmission valves.

Joanne's daughter, Andrea is a critical care nurse in one of the hospitals near Detroit that has seen both shortages of protective gear and multiple staffers diagnosed with COVID-19.

Norah O'Donnell: And when your manager called to ask if you would come back not to make cars, but to make face masks, did you think about your daughter and helping her?

Joanne Ritchie: That was the first thing that came to my mind. I thought, ""I'm gonna protect her. If I can, I'm gonna protect her. I'm gonna give her what she needs to do her job.""

Joanne Ritchie goes to her job at the factory every morning at 4:30 a.m., seven days a week. About an hour after she leaves for work, her daughter heads for her job at the hospital, to treat COVID-19 patients.

Joanne Ritchie: The first couple days that she came home, she was-- you couldn't even look at her in the face. She didn't wanna talk. And I says, ""I'm worried about you. I'm-- I'm waiting to make sure that you come home at night (CRYING) 'cause I don't know if you're gonna come home.""

Norah O'Donnell: She really is on the frontlines.

Joanne Ritchie: Oh yeah, she is. Sorry about that. (LAUGH)

Turns out, it runs in the family. During World War II, Joanne's grandmother, Chiara worked for the Hudson Motor Car Company in Detroit, helping to make planes and engines for the U.S. war machine, just as millions of other women did in factories all around the country.

Norah O'Donnell: Your grandmother Chiara was a real Rosie the Riveter.

Joanne Ritchie: Yes, she was. You just step up to the plate.

GM's George Vandermeir also stepped up. The first shipments of ventilators he helped build went out to Chicago area hospitals last week.

Norah O'Donnell: When you first saw a ventilator built and completed, ready to ship, how did that make you feel?

George Vandermeir: It was amazing. What we could do in such a short period of time, taking a vision and making it reality in three or four works. And we all got that opportunity to sign the box of the first shipments.

Norah O'Donnell: Worth putting retirement off for?

George Vandermeir: Absolutely. Hands down, no question.

A little-known band of doctors and hi-tech wizards say they were able to find the vital speed needed to attack the coronavirus: the computing power of artificial intelligence. They call their new weapon ""outbreak science."" It could change the way we fight another contagion. Already it has led to calls for an overhaul of how the federal government does things. But first, we'll take you inside BlueDot, a small Canadian company with an algorithm that scours the world for outbreaks of infectious disease. It's a digital early warning system, and it was among the first to raise alarms about this lethal outbreak.

It was New Year's Eve when BlueDot's computer spat out an alert: a Chinese business paper had just reported 27 cases of a mysterious flu-like disease in Wuhan, a city of 11 million. The signs were ominous. Seven people were already in hospitals.

Almost all the cases came from the city's sprawling market, where live animals are packed in cages and slaughtered on-site. Medical detectives are now investigating if this is where the epidemic began, when the virus made the leap from animals to us.

Dr. Kamran Khan

Half a world away on the Toronto waterfront, BlueDot's founder and CEO, Dr. Kamran Khan, was on his way to work. An infectious disease physician, he had seen another coronavirus in 2003 – SARS – kill three colleagues. When we spoke with him remotely he told us this outbreak had him worried.

Dr. Kamran Khan: We did not know that this would become the next pandemic. But we did know that there were echoes of the SARS outbreak, and it was something that we really should be paying attention to.

COVID-19 soon got the world's attention. BlueDot's Toronto staff now works from home, except for Dr. Khan. But in December, the office kicked into high-gear as they rushed to verify the alert.

Chinese officials were secretive about what was happening. But BlueDot's computer doesn't rely on official statements. Their algorithm was already churning through data, including medical bulletins, even livestock reports, to predict where the virus would go next.

It was also scanning the ticket data from 4,000 airports.

BlueDot wasn't just tracking flights, but calculating the cities at greatest risk. On December 31, there were more than 800,000 travellers leaving Wuhan, some likely carrying the disease.

Dr. Kamran Khan: So these yellow lines reflect the nonstop flights going out of Wuhan. And then the blue circles reflect the final destinations of travelers. The larger the circle, the larger number of travelers who are going to that location. These were many of the first cities that actually received cases of COVID-19 as it spread out of mainland China.

Bill Whitaker: You can do that in a matter of seconds?

Dr. Kamran Khan: We can analyze and visualize all this information across the globe in just a few seconds.

The virus wasn't just spreading to east Asia. Thousands of travelers were heading to the United States too.

Dr. Kamran Khan: Most of the travel came into California and San Francisco and Los Angeles. Uh, also, into New York City. And we analyzed that way back on December 31. Our surveillance system that picked up the outbreak of Wuhan automatically talks to the system that is looking at how travelers might go to various airports around Wuhan.

Bill Whitaker: So when you see that map, you don't just see flight patterns?

Dr. Kamran Khan: If you think of an outbreak a bit like a fire and embers flying off, these are like embers flying off into different locations.

Bill Whitaker: So in this case, that ember landed in dry brush in New York and started a wildfire?

Dr. Kamran Khan: Absolutely.

Dr. Khan told us he had spent the better part of a year persuading the airlines to share their flight data for public health. Nobody had ever asked that before. But he saw it as information gold.

Dr. Kamran Khan: How is it that someone knows 16B - that seat is available, but 14A has been taken? There clearly must be some kind of information system.

Bill Whitaker: Why is that so important?

Dr. Kamran Khan: There are over 4 billion of us that board commercial flights and travel around the world every year. And so that is why understanding population movements becomes so important in anticipating how disease is spread.

Dr. Kamran Khan

The virus spread across Asia with a vengeance. BlueDot has licensed access to the anonymized location data from millions of cellphones. And with that data it identified 12 of the 20 cities that would suffer first.

Dr. Kamran Khan: What we're looking at here are mobile devices that were in Wuhan in the previous 14 days and where are they now across East Asia. Places like Tokyo have a lot of devices, Seoul in South Korea--

Bill Whitaker: So you're following those devices from Wuhan to these other cities?

Dr. Kamran Khan: That's correct. I do wanna point out these are also anonymized data. But they allow us to understand population movements. That is how we can understand how this virus will spread.

To build their algorithm, Dr. Khan told us he deliberately hired an eclectic mix: engineers, ecologists, geographers, veterinarians all under one roof. They spent a year teaching the computer to detect 150 deadly pathogens.

Dr. Kamran Khan: We can ultimately train a machine to be reading through all the text and picking out components that this is talking about an outbreak of anthrax and this is talking about the heavy metal band Anthrax. And as you do this thousands and thousands and thousands of times, the machine starts to get smarter and smarter.

Bill Whitaker: And how many different languages does the computer understand?

Dr. Kamran Khan: So it's reading this currently in 65 languages, and processing this information every 15 minutes, 24 hours a day. So it's a lotta data to go through.

Within two hours of detecting the outbreak on December 31, BlueDot had sent a warning of the potential threat to its clients: public health officials in 12 countries, airlines and frontline hospitals, like Humber River in Toronto.

Dr. Michael Gardam: We've been able to really make a lot of decisions, I think, a little bit earlier 'cause I kinda feel like we had a bit of an inside scoop here.

One of Canada's top infectious disease physicians, Dr. Michael Gardam, told us it was like getting real time intelligence.

Bill Whitaker: What did you do when you got that information from BlueDot?

Dr. Michael Gardam: Getting that intel allowed me to kinda be the canary in the coal mine, to stand up and say we need to pay attention to this. And to start thinking about it, start thinking about supplies, start thinking about how busy we might be.

Dr. Michael Gardam

Dr. Michael Gardam: Now at this point, everybody knows about CoVid-19. But it's, it's not so much now. Now you've pretty much bought whatever PPE you can buy, it's very hard to buy that anymore. It's what did you do a month and a half ago that was so important. So, none of this is any surprise to us whatsoever, and yet, you see countries around the world where this has been a surprise.

BlueDot had no clients in the U.S., so while Dr. Gardam's hospital was making plans in January, President Trump, as late as March, was still assuring Americans that everything was under control.

California wasn't so sure, and braced for the worst. In March, it became the first state in the country to lock down its cities. Mickey Mouse suddenly looked lonely, drivers had only dreamed of such empty freeways. But the lock-down bought time. Despite having its first case of COVID-19 five weeks before New York, California dodged the hurricane of infection that slammed into New York City. At his daily teleconference in Sacramento, Governor Gavin Newsom made no secret where he'd gotten his edge: outbreak science.

Governor Gavin Newsom

Gavin Newsom: It's not a gross exaggeration when I say this – the old modeling is literally pen–to-paper in some cases. And then you put it into some modest little computer program and it spits a piece of paper out. I mean, this is a whole other level of sophistication and data collection.

With the virus spreading around the world, California enlisted the help of BlueDot, Esri, Facebook and others, using mapping technologies and cell phone data to predict which hospitals would be hit hardest, and see if Californians were really staying at home. Data became California's all-seeing crystal ball.

Gavin Newsom: We are literally seeing in to the future and predicting in real-time based on constant update of information where patterns are starting to occur before they become headlines.

Bill Whitaker: Can you just sort of like, give me an example?

Gavin Newsom: We can see in real time on a daily basis, hourly basis, moment-by-moment basis if necessary, whether or not our stay-at-home orders were working. We can truly track now by census tract, not just by county.

Here's what it looked like. BlueDot scanned anonymous cell phone data over a 24-hour period last month in Los Angeles. The blue circles indicate less movement than the week before, the red spots show where people are still gathering. It could be a hospital – or a problem. That cellphone data allows public health officials to investigate. It also raises worrisome privacy issues.

Bill Whitaker: How are you able to ensure that this cell phone data will remain anonymous?

Gavin Newsom: Well, I didn't want to take the companies' words for it, I say that respectfully. I have a team of folks that are privacy-first advocates in our Technology Department. And we are making sure that no individualized data is provided. If it is, we're out.

Bill Whitaker: So what's been the most frustrating part of this for you?

Gavin Newsom: It's just incumbent upon us to have a national lens. And to recognize we're

many parts but one body. And if one part suffers, we all suffer.

Bill Whitaker: From this experience, do you think the Federal Government needs to overhaul the way it tackles pandemics?

Gavin Newsom: I don't know that there's a human being out there, maybe one or two, that would suggest otherwise. No, the absolute answer is, of course, unequivocally.

Dylan George: Data technology has transformed the way we do business in many aspects of our lives. But it has not transformed the way things are done in public health.

Dylan George

For Dylan George that's an urgent priority. As a scientist tracking biological threats in the Bush and Obama administrations, he has seen first-hand what he calls the panic-neglect cycle.

Dylan George: Perhaps the most tragic idea in all of public health is this: in a time of an outbreak everyone lights their hair on fire and is running around trying to figure out. After it's over, everyone forgets about it

He has joined a growing number of scientists pressing to revive an old idea: an infectious disease forecasting center modeled on the National Weather Service.

Dylan George: We need to have professionals that their day job is dedicated to helping us understand how infectious diseases will-- will risk our well being economically and from a national security perspective.

Bill Whitaker: That idea has been kicking around for a while. It's never gotten the funding. Do you think things will be different this time?

Dylan George: When we see that there is $2 trillion being spent on stimulus bills to help us get out of this, to make sure that we can rebound, we need to think transformatively. We need to think broadly about how we can move these things forward. This kind of a center would help us do that.

As the coronavirus continues to upend our lives, Toronto's Dr. Michael Gardam told us he has seen the difference a digital early-warning system can make.

Dr. Michael Gardam: One of the biggest challenges in infectious diseases is you never wanna be the doctor that picks up the first case because you're probably going to miss it. And you probably weren't wearing the right gear and it's probably already spread in your hospital. And so getting the early warning that help gives you the intel to make that first call is so incredibly important.

But the military's number one mission has been to defend its own ranks against infection. It can't protect the nation if it can't defend itself. The aircraft carrier Roosevelt made headlines when the coronavirus ran roughshod through its crew. And there have been other outbreaks that required drastic measures to contain.

Everything in the Army starts with basic training. And every day starts before dawn. But it never looked or sounded like this before.

It's not dust Drill Sergeant David Castelow is worried about. It's coronavirus. And that's why he takes every recruit's temperature first thing.

Drill Sergeant David Castelow: If your organization is infected by something like this, you know, these people, these initial entry trainees, are our combat power. So if they go down, or and if we can't do it safely, then we are rendering ourselves obsolete.

Coronavirus pandemic tests U.S. military planning

Last month, 63 recruits in a class of 940 here at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, tested positive for the virus and upended basic training.

Drill Sergeant Porter: You're going to do everything that I tell you. You do not move unless I tell you to.

That's not a recruit he's barking at. It's a four-star general, Army Chief of Staff James McConville.

Army Chief of Staff Gen. James McConville (right) goes back to basic training.

McConville took on the role of a recruit to witness the revamped training first hand after the coronavirus had forced the Army to stop taking in new soldiers.

Gen. James McConville: We took a two week pause.

David Martin: So for two weeks, you're not taking in any recruits?

Gen. James McConville: That's correct.

David Martin: Has that ever happened before?

Gen. James McConville: I'm not aware of any time – at least, in my 39 years where we stopped taking recruits in. But these are different times.

Training is still going on at Fort Jackson for recruits who arrived before the two-week pause. But now every soldier is wearing a face mask, loading up on hand sanitizer before moving into firing position and trying to stay six feet apart.

We call it ""social distancing."" The Army calls it ""tacticial dispersion.""

Lt. Col. Patrick Collins: We have been executing socially distanced enabled training since week 2.



Either way, Lt. Col. Patrick Collins tells Gen. McConville it's a problem.

Lt. Col. Patrick Collins: Day to day our biggest problem is keeping them in that six feet. Because, you tend to tell them, ""O.K. separate. Get your six feet."" You know, a couple minutes later, you know, just kind of natural human behavior. They start clustering again and you, and you, you've gotta tell them again.

Gen. James McConville

Nothing at Fort Jackson is natural anymore. The Army likes to say it has the best dressed soldiers in the world, but tailors who usually alter uniforms for a better fit are now turning out face masks.

Gen. James McConville: These just got here. These are brand new.

David Martin: Brand new?

And the single most important equipment McConville saw on his tour was a pair of high-speed COVID-19 test machines.

Col. Koenig: That'd give us the ability to test 750-plus in one day with a one-day turnaround. And then they go and we can then test that bubble also. We can continue to expand the bubbles of testing so that we can make sure we can cut it off right at the source, rather than watch it spread through a unit.

The chief of staff's job is to get the Army ready to fight. But these days, Gen. McConville told us he spends three quarters of his time trying to fight coronavirus to keep his soldiers healthy. Just six weeks ago he was sending heavy armor to Europe for one of the largest exercises since the Cold War.

Gen. James McConville: The toughest decision that-- that we had to make was to cancel Defender 20.

Defender 20 meant sending an entire division-sized force and its equipment to Europe, just as the virus was assaulting the continent.

Gen. James McConville: We just started war-gaming what would happen if we had 15,000 or 20,000 soldiers in a very close environment and, you know, and the virus broke out? How would we take care of them? And did we want to put our soldiers at that much risk for a training exercise? And we chose not to.

David Martin: You have to curtail training. You have to postpone major exercises. That's got to take a toll on the readiness of the Army.

Gen. James McConville: From where I sit, I'm looking at the long game, and the long game is that we have to protect the force to protect the nation.

David Martin: How big a price have you paid so far?

Gen. James McConville: I don't think we've paid a huge price yet. Am I concerned long term? Absolutely.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: I'll be honest. It's been a little bit intimidating thinking about it. You train in your career to fight an enemy that you can see. This is one that you can't.

Air Force Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler, a fighter pilot, is about as far removed from basic training as it gets, underneath 1,500 feet of granite at this command post inside Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: It is a secure location that we intend to operate out of in wartime.

David Martin: Well, this is wartime, isn't it?

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: It is, but it's really a different kind of war.

Cheyenne Mountain was built to withstand a nuclear blast but every time a watch team makes this half-mile walk into the mountain, they risk bringing the virus with them. Which is why each team spends 14 days in quarantine before going on duty. When their watch starts.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: The first step you do is you start wiping down every surface, your computers, your telephones, your desk surfaces, door handles, etc. to make sure that all those are clean as well. It's a bit like an obsessive compulsive disorder (laugh). But we have to be able to make sure that there's no exposure to that virus.

Because our 60 Minutes team had not been quarantined, our cameras were not allowed inside the mountain. This footage was shot by the military. The interview was conducted from the Pentagon.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: When occasionally we have to bring somebody from outside into our bubble for work on an IT system, for example, we scatter like cockroaches. It's as if this is the most dangerous thing we've ever done in our careers. It's not being shot at. It's not flying combat. It's actually having somebody from outside the bubble arrive inside of here.

The command center at Cheyenne Mountain

This command center performs what Fesler calls a zero-fail mission: a 24/7 watch against a missile or bomber attack on the United States. Since the pandemic began, Cheyenne Mountain has scrambled jets to intercept Russian aircraft off the coast of Alaska three times.

David Martin: You think they were testing you at all to see if anybody was home at Cheyenne Mountain.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: I suspect that the way that they look at those sorties probably is related to understanding our ability to operate in a COVID environment.

Cheyenne Mountain was ready for the Russians but not for the coronavirus.

Brig. Gen. Pete Fesler: This is something new. This is something that we had to invent on the fly as our adversary was not exactly like the one we had planned to fight.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: There are so many aspects of what's going on now that are not things that we expected that we would be doing.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy, head of the U.S. Northern Command, is the man in charge of defending the homeland. He had plans for dealing with all kinds of disasters, including a pandemic, but nothing on this scale.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: Often we practice what we call the complex disasters, where we might have an earthquake, maybe, that hit multiple states and we consider those to be complex. And to have a national-- actual disasters declared in the 50 states and the responses happening with them, that is unprecedented.

David Martin: So, you know the old saying about plans, no plan ever survives first contact with the enemy.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: This plan did not survive contact with the enemy.

Despite all the top secret intelligence he sees, O'Shaughnessy did not have a good understanding of the virus.

Gen. Terrence O'Shaughnessy: Having an enemy that you don't fully understand is always a little bit frustrating.

Gen. John Hyten: We still don't fully understand the virus.

Gen. John Hyten

Gen. John Hyten is the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the number two man in the military. Twice each day he holds a video conference with the pentagon's crisis management team located two floors below in the national military command center.

Gen. John Hyten: We had so many assumptions of what a virus would do, what a pandemic flu would do. And then when you actually see what coronavirus does, what COVID-19 does, it's completely different.

The nastiest surprise was the aircraft carrier Roosevelt. Not only did the virus sideline one of the most important ships in the Navy but the majority of the more than 800 crew members who tested positive had no symptoms.

Gen. John Hyten: You think you finally start to understand it, and then you get data off the Theodore Roosevelt, of the very large number of asymptomatic cases. And then you try to understand whether the asymptomatic cases are contagious. How contagious are they? That's medical questions that we still don't fully understand the answers to.

Many of the answers depended on testing and the Pentagon had to use its transport planes to airlift millions of test swabs into the United States from Europe.

David Martin: From the outside looking in, it seemed like it was one emergency stopgap shipment of medical supplies after another. Was that what it was like on the inside looking out?

Gen. John Hyten: On the inside looking out I'll say it didn't look like an emergency but it was difficult. It was difficult to figure out exactly where to go. And then when we decided to move-- we had to move quickly to get it in the right place. But the one thing that we do really well is we move stuff.

The Army Corps of Engineers set up hospitals like this one at Chicago's McCormick Place Convention Center all across the country, creating by last count about 15,000 beds in case local hospitals were overwhelmed.

David Martin: Were those hospitals the last line of defense?

Gen. John Hyten: We looked at it as the last line of defense.

David Martin: Where would the medical personnel to staff all those beds come from?

Gen. John Hyten: I have to be honest, we were worried about whether we'd run outta capacity early on when we were lookin' at those big numbers. It was not just space but, we were worried about doctors, nurses, corpsmen, respiratory therapists. We were worried about all those things.

David Martin: If this virus had not been slowed by social distancing, would the U.S. military have had the capability and capacity to defeat that virus?

Gen. John Hyten: That's what we were worried about. A situation where we woulda been basically mobilizing everything we had. It would been a different world. And I can't tell you right now how we woulda closed that.

It's a question the American military rarely has to ask itself, but the definition of what it takes to be a superpower has changed forever.

David Martin: So what will it take to get the military back to normal?

Gen. John Hyten: 2019 normal will never exist again. We have to figure out how to operate and fight through a world where coronavirus exists. If we just wait for what, you know, everybody hopes is gonna happen, which is the disease goes away, and it doesn't, and we haven't planned for the-- for the other case, we're in a bad situation.

So far, he's helped tens of thousands of people through his relief efforts, and he has no plans of slowing down.

On Friday, Fieri announced that the Restaurant Employee Relief Fund (RERF), which he started in partnership with the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, is awarding 10,000 new grants to restaurant workers.

The foundation has approved 40,000 grants total since launching last month, the celebrity chef revealed in an interview with TMZ Live on Friday.

""I started thinking about my brothers and sisters in the restaurant business, and a bunch of restaurants that I was closing — we gotta do something,"" Fieri said of starting the relief fund.

The ""Mayor of Flavortown"" said the fund has now raised $21.5 million for struggling restaurant industry workers since lockdowns were implemented nationwide less than two months ago.

Fieri said he personally sent video messages to CEOs from PepsiCo, The Coca-Cola Company, Uber Eats and other companies to partner with the fund. Celebrities and over 40 big-name brands have also joined the cause, including Food Network, Live Nation, Corona, TikTok and Netflix, among others.

""As long as the money comes in, we're gonna continue to give these grants,"" Fieri said.

A staggering 29 million Americans lost their livelihoods in April as COVID-19 shuttered stores, factories and offices, and canceled events nationwide. With many restaurants and bars across the country closed or limited to take-out service, the restaurant industry has suffered billions of dollars in losses, with no clear path to recovery.

So far, the restaurant employee relief fund has awarded $500 grants to 40,000 applicants. Restaurant workers who have been impacted financially by the pandemic can apply can for a grant on the RERF website. However, due to an ""overwhelming response"" of more than 60,000 applicants, the Fund has temporarily stopped accepting new applications.

Fieri remains hopeful for the future of the industry. ""I think people are gonna be fired up, gung-ho and ready to get out there and visit their restaurants a lot more than they were prior to the pandemic,"" he said.",100,High,Left-center

While he serves as a special assistant to the Chicago Cubs, he is also a mortician and helping South Floridians through their most difficult time, CBS Miami reports.

Dawson owns a well-known funeral home in Richmond Heights, a Miami-Dade community full of tradition and history.

The homegrown baseball hero, who slugged his way into the Hall of Fame, is now in a world far removed from his previous life.

""As an athlete, you are kind of used to the crowd roaring and cheers and this is completely the opposite,"" he told CBS Miami's sports anchor Jim Berry.

A year ago, Dawson was just a passive investor at the Paradise Memorial Funeral Home, but when the business fell into his lap, he and his family took it on. Little he did know that months later, his industry would be coping with a global pandemic.

""It's like a nightmare, and the sad thing is you can't be too careful,"" he said.

His wife of 42 years, Vanessa, is the office manager, while his uncle runs the day to day operation. The staff totals 23, and they're wearing masks and going through a lot of hand sanitizer.

South Florida has not been overwhelmed with COVID-19 cases like New York, but Dawson said its effects here are still hugely challenging. Uncertainties about the virus lingering in those who have died has his staff taking extra precautions.

Social distancing and limiting services to 10 people can take a heavy emotional toll.

""The sad emotional side of me comes out a lot especially if its someone that you know, but trust me I do have a lot of moments but at the end of the day after doing two or three services you are pretty beat up,"" he explained.

When Dawson's former baseball buddies heard about his new endeavor, they were stunned.

""I got a lot funny stares. Jim Rice looked at me and said 'You're doing what?' I got a similar stare from Rickey Henderson. It's funny, the first thing I throw back at them is 'Here, I have a business card for you,'"" he said laughing.

It has been an adjustment, but the once mighty slugger is learning how to make a difference in a different way.

""All I want to do at this point is to be able to continue to serve and if I can be confident in that regard then this is all worth it,"" Dawson explained.

The Miami native ended his 21-year major league career in 1996. He was an eight-time All-Star despite knee injuries that have led to more than a dozen operations. He's best remembered for his 49-homer season with the Chicago Cubs in 1987, when he was voted the National League Most Valuable Player.

According to the RNC, in the weeks since they've gone fully virtual in their operation, they have held nearly 3,900 Trump Victory Leadership Initiative training sessions and more than 1,700 MAGA meet-ups. The committee also noted that they've made more than 20 million voter contacts and have added more than 300,000 new volunteers to their team since making the virtual transition.

""Modern campaigns are all done with digital and through apps,"" said RNC and Trump Victory spokesperson Rick Gorka, who added that being able to phone bank from home creates flexibility for volunteers. ""For us, it's just that that virtual campaign has been a part of what we've done throughout this [and] since the 2016 cycle.""

At the same time, the DNC digital unit has worked to help different departments move online and at the beginning of April, the committee announced in a memo that there had been nearly 7,000 individuals trained on digital organizing tools in the span of a few weeks through the committee's Digital Organizing 101 training sessions. Through partnerships with state parties in battleground states like Florida and Georgia, the committee has sent 2.8 million text messages to voters encouraging them to vote by mail. And the DNC has embedded 11 digital organizing fellows in the battleground states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

""Organizing at its core is just relationship-building. I think digital organizing is like that as well. How connected does a supporter feel to us and how much of the party do they feel like is their own,"" said DNC Digital Organizing director Meg DiMartino. ""The thing I think about often is how do we continue to deepen and build that online …what are more ways that our supporters, our volunteers can feel more ownership over this program.""

NDTC training

Democrats only recently wrapped up a historically crowded presidential primary, with more than two dozen candidates vying for the nomination. After Joe Biden became the presumptive nominee in April, the Democratic Party immediately announced it would be using its resources to help his campaign scale up quickly. This came as the Biden campaign also had to shift all campaign efforts online. Organizing teams have remained engaged using Zoom to host action events like writing letters and creating signs for first responders. The campaign has also held community calls to check in with how volunteers and supporters are doing during the pandemic.

CBS News attended virtual training sessions with the DNC, RNC, and National Democratic Training Committee, to observe how the campaigns are engaging with voters behind closed doors. Training sessions with as many as 300 participants allowed people to tune in from home offices, living rooms, kitchens or even bedrooms. Volunteers of all ages intently stared at computer screens as hosts drilled down using PowerPoint presentations that lasted 10 to 45 minutes. One of the training sessions featured voters from at least seven different states, another had a steady stream of questions from participants that would show up as blinking notifications in the ""Comments"" section. After presentations, participants were sent handouts, and in some cases, had the opportunity to practice their newly-acquired skills with the trainer on the line.

""These virtual trainings are so easy. And you're actually able to do a lot more of them because you're not traveling from location to location,"" said Florida Republican Party chairman Joe Gruters, who gave remarks during a recent RNC virtual training. ""It's the exact same thing that you would do whether you see them in person, or you could do it over the phone because it's all about getting people set up on the system that they could use in their own homes to make those calls.""

ON THE GROUND FROM COAST TO COAST

Officials from both parties and training organizations insist that digital migration has been made easier because they were already in the process of putting infrastructure in place. CBS News spoke with a dozen Democratic and Republican state parties to survey how the shift to digital has impacted their operations.

""With all the technology that's available…we've done an incredible amount of voter contacts,"" Gruters said. He added that his team has made 4.5 million calls since going fully digital. ""We're hitting all of our numbers and the great thing about what we're able to do is when people are at home because of this crisis, you essentially have a captive audience.""

""One thing that's really interesting is, switching to virtual has actually allowed the team to connect more with rural voters,"" said Iowa Republican Party Communications Director Aaron Britt. He pointed out that rural voters helped President Trump win in 2016, saying ""that's been one of the great offsets especially here in Iowa, the uptick that we've seen in being able to connect with those rural voters as we make a lot of phone calls and things like that.""

Colorado Republican Party Communications director Joe Jackson noted that in his state, a one-size-fits-all approach does not work in both rural and urban areas, so they transitioned events starting at the county party level. When they did their caucuses and assembly, decisions were made at the local level within the governor's guidelines, leaving some counties to conduct drive-through caucuses while others did Zoom meetings or emails.

For Democrats, multiple state parties are trying to maintain high voter engagement. In many states where there was record voter turnout in primaries before the coronavirus pandemic, people have since been forced to shelter in place.

In late April, the North Carolina Democratic Party had record turnout during its county conventions, which were held virtually using Zoom for the first time. Normally, the conventions would have used a county-by-county approach, but because of the pandemic, the party centralized training and coordination to ensure the conventions ran smoothly. Officials and campaigns have also been using texting, phone banking, and holding virtual events and organizing communities online.

""Notwithstanding the challenge, I believe we are more organized and more focused than ever before,"" said NCDP Chair Wayne Goodwin. ""We had no choice but to do that.""

The Michigan Democratic party said it recruited more than 3,000 volunteers and made more than 60,000 direct voter contact calls in the first month of distancing. The party has continued to interview and train organizers, with a goal of having 70 in the state by the end of May. The Organizing Corps program, which trains college students, will be hosting a virtual bootcamp to train a third wave of organizers in the next few weeks for organizing in Michigan.

""We continue to grow this ground game,"" said MDP Chair Lavora Barnes. The 2020 organizing efforts have been underway since 2017. ""It's currently virtual organizers and a lot of these tools that we're using now, we'll continue to use even if or when we're able to get back out and knock on doors and stand on folks' porches and have conversations with them.""

Florida Democratic Party executive director Juan Peñalosa said they've already begun to implement contingency plans if the party has to continue digital organizing through November.

""I think now more than ever, when people vote in November, they're going to think about who helped them, who was there for them during this pandemic, through this crisis. And we've inserted that question into every aspect of our organizing program,"" said Peñalosa. ""Voters today are worried about their health, their jobs, home schooling, their kids. They're lonely and frustrated and good campaigns meet people where they are and our campaign is focused on meeting people where they are. So all of our outreach begins with a wellness check.""

In late March, the Texas Democratic Party launched a series of new programs. Those programs include an online community hub called ConnectTexas, a network of check-in calls across every county called Connect254 and a Community Captains program that has already recruited nearly 500 people. In a state without online voter registration, the party also launched a website in late April to facilitate getting registration forms and postage into the hands of new voters.

Before the pandemic crippled the country, the Texas Democratic Party told CBS News it was planning to put up to 1,000 field organizers and canvassers on the ground in the state as part of their effort to turn Texas from red to blue. At the time, more than 2 million voters participated in the state's Democratic presidential primary, and the party said its organizing operation would be the biggest in the state party's and perhaps Texas history. CBS News learned in a followup last week that the goal has not changed — it's just significantly shifted online.

""That's what organizing and campaigning are, you have to be willing to pivot, but you want to be clear, what we're doing now is aligned with what we planned to do which is building relationships, building connections,"" said Texas Democratic Party organizing director Olivia Stitilis.

DIGITAL GROWING PAINS

While field operations across the country have jumped into online organizing head on, the reliance on technology has not been without adjustments. In South Carolina, the state Democratic Party has worked with counties to hold virtual conventions for the past month. And original plans to hire a significant field staff have changed for the time being.

""We're analyzing the way we're going to have our state convention, we're doing our executive committee meetings completely differently…so there's been a completely re-organization as to how you organize, but also how you go about doing the perfunctory business of running the state party,"" said SCDP Chairman Trav Robertson. ""There's a portion of it that you anticipate doing as everything goes to a digital type of platform or campaign but I mean, the majority of this is a result of COVID-19.""

Training organizations like the National Democratic Training Committee and the conservative Leadership Institute have added online courses to help down ballot candidates and people who are interested in public policy to navigate campaigns and voter engagement during the pandemic.

""Campaigns are naturally risk-averse and late adopters of technology...for a variety of reasons,"" said National Democratic Training Committee CEO Kelly Deitrich. ""[Texting] is not normally a technology that down ballot campaigns with limited time, money and people invest in. They're out knocking on doors. Well, they don't have that option anymore. They're forced to adopt these new ways of communicating and reaching voters that wouldn't have been their first choice, but now may be their only choice.""

""I wouldn't say the goals have changed, I would say the relevant topics have changed,"" said Ron Nehring, who has worked at the Leadership Institute for five years. ""We're still teaching political technology but we're teaching in subjects that we haven't had to cover before. We've never had to do a program on 'how do you keep your campaign alive during a pandemic.""",100,High,Left-center

The Humanity Forward Fund, a nonprofit founded by Yang after he suspended his 2020 presidential campaign, will begin sending $1,000 over the next couple of weeks to 1,000 households in New York City's Bronx borough.

""We figured out very quickly that people are going to need money immediately. And our government should do this,"" Andrew Yang told CBS News in a phone interview on Friday. ""[This fund] exists to demonstrate the power of these ideas, so we started giving money out immediately.""

Yang is no stranger to cash stipends. Before the coronavirus crisis in the U.S., Yang, then a presidential candidate, proposed granting every adult American monthly payments of $1,000, turning the concept of ""Universal Basic Income"" into a household name, for many. His presidential campaign launched a ""Freedom Dividend Pilot Program"" to test and promote his signature policy, in December 2019.

Yet distributing cash fast to 1,000 households brought to light larger logistical problems amid CDC-mandated social distancing. ""It actually took us a little while to figure out how we could give that money effectively to people in the Bronx who needed it,"" Yang said. ""The tricky thing is actually trying to get money to people who need it at a time when you know you shouldn't be knocking on doors.""

While the former presidential candidate initially reached out to Citigroup and J.P. Morgan for assistance, privacy regulations prevented the entrepreneur from partnering with banks. Ultimately, the nonprofit teamed up with Neighborhood Trust Financial Partners and the Collective Education PAC to distribute stipends, targeting struggling families as businesses furlough hourly employees, faced with the spread of COVID-19.

The group will also work hand in hand with One Fair Wage (OFW), contributing to the ""Emergency Coronavirus Tipped and Service Worker Support Fund"" to benefit service workers across New York City who are stifled by the economic shutdown.

""With the closing of all of the bars and restaurants, and now, essentially nail salons and gyms and everything else, New York has tens, even hundreds of thousands of service workers who now don't have a source of income,"" Andrew Yang told CBS News in a phone interview on Friday. ""And New York is also the most densely populated city in our country. So if there's any place you would want people to have the ability to stay home, not have to worry about where their next grocery money or rent check is going to come from, it would be in New York, in a place like the Bronx.""

In an effort to inspire more awareness and giving online, the fund has also pledged $100,000 in micro-grants of $250 or $500 distributed directly via social media networks – Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. ""Clearly, if your neighbor is struggling, you should help them. But the truth is that some people will be on social media an awful lot because we're all trapped at home,"" Yang conceded. ""And so if you can find a way for someone to be engaged that's actually productive via social media, either to get help or give help, that struck us as very positive.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell set a deadline of 11:59 p.m. Friday for bipartisan agreement on the mounting stimulus package that could push $1 trillion and include direct payments to U.S. households reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Yang tweeted Tuesday that his team ""has been in touch with the White House"" and is offering up further resources. The former presidential candidate says while he's thrilled ""common sense is prevailing,"" there will be no victory lap. Yang has encouraged lawmakers to think beyond one-time payments to families hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. ""To me, we don't know how long this crisis is going to continue. You want people to have confidence that their family is going to be okay, even if this crisis drags on for a while,"" Yang told CBS News. ""So instead of one check you should be looking at regular checks once a month or even more frequent, so that we have our basic needs met, even if this does drag on for quite some time.""

Despite dropping out of the race, Yang – who endorsed Joe Biden earlier this month — predicts monthly payments to American families will be ""a major topic"" in the upcoming presidential election and legislative sessions. ""I think both parties are going to be embracing it to a much higher degree. And I believe it's going to end up passing here in the United States in the next number of months,"" he said.

Hunkered down in his own home in New York, Yang expresses remorse in hearing the personal stories of former campaign staff, friends and neighbors, isolated by quarantine and social distancing. ""I am deeply concerned that this pandemic is going to cut us off from each other at a time when what we need is actually the ability to help each other,"" Yang said. ""And certainly I'm doing everything I can to help by sending money digitally, but that is not what most people need. Most people need things in person and face to face. That's the way we're wired as people. And so I think it's very hard to see a silver lining in this crisis.""

After a choir practice in Washington state in March, 52 out of 61 attendees became ill, 32 of whom were confirmed to have COVID-19 and 20 had symptoms consistent with the virus, according to Skagit County Public Health.

The investigation determined that only one person at the practice had ""cold-like symptoms"" beginning a few days prior to the practice. That individual was later confirmed to have COVID-19, Skagit County Public Health said.

The choir practice is not the only super-spreading event that has happened during the coronavirus pandemic, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the potential for these events ""underscores the importance"" of social distancing and avoiding large gatherings.

Here's a breakdown of what these events are and how they happen.

What is a super-spreading event?

Super-spreading events ""occur when a single person infects a large number of other people — sometimes 10, 20, sometimes even more in one setting,"" said Dr. Justin Lessler, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.



Other examples of super-spreading events during the coronavirus pandemic include 15 cases stemming from one person at multiple family gatherings in Chicago and more than 100 cases tracing back to multiple South Korean nightclubs that were visited by a man who later tested positive for the virus.



The term ""super-spreader"" refers to a person who spreads a disease to a large number of people.

""It's kind of different for different diseases whether it's a person or an event, but for COVID, it would be more like an event,"" said Dr. Jaline Gerardin, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.



The ""world's most famous super-spreader"" was Mary Mallon, known as ""Typhoid Mary,"" Lessler said. She infected many people with typhoid fever over several years in the early 1900s.

How do super-spreading events happen?

These events happen because of ""a combination of biology and setting,"" Lessler said.

An infected person has to be at a point in their illness when they are very transmissible and they have to be in a place where they can infect a lot of other people.

Places where people are densely packed and engaging in something that involves a lot of breathing, like singing or talking, are particularly risky for super spreading, Gerardin said.

Could the infected person be asymptomatic?

Yes, the person could be asymptomatic or presymptomatic, the doctors said.

""They may not feel sick, but the infection has spread enough in their body that they're shedding virus and they're putting enough virus out there to infect other people,"" Lessler said.

What is the average infection rate for the coronavirus?

Doctors have said they believe the number of people that one person with coronavirus typically infects is two to three. That number, however, is considered ""over-dispersed,"" Lessler said.

""When we say over-dispersed, what we mean is there are super-spreading events, so the average might be two, let's say, but most people are infecting one or no people and then a very few people are infecting 8 to 10 or even more people,"" he said.

The number of typical infections also varies by the density of an area and whether or not people are staying home.

How do we prevent super-spreading events?

The social distancing guidelines many places have adopted help reduce super-spreading events, the doctors said.

""We can either prevent them entirely by limiting the size of gatherings or we can mitigate a lot of the risk through good prevention,"" such as having everyone wear masks and being somewhere that's well ventilated, Gerardin said.",100,High,Left-center

Ulster County officials are now recommending anyone who received a haircut from the barber in the past three weeks should seek a coronavirus test.

Under Governor Andrew Cuomo's ""New York Pause"" policy, barbershops, beauty salons, nail salons and other personal hygiene services have been ordered closed to reduce the risk of spreading the virus.

In the notice, Ulster County Health Commissioner Dr. Carol Smith did not identify the barber by name, but said the shop was located on Broadway in Kingston, New York.

""We are taking extraordinary measures to try and minimize the spread of this dangerous disease,"" Smith said in the notice. ""Learning that a barbershop has been operating illicitly for weeks with a COVID-19 positive employee is extraordinarily disheartening.""

""As much as we would all like to go out and get a professional haircut, this kind of direct contact has the potential to dramatically spread this virus throughout our community and beyond,"" she continued.

Smith urged anyone who received a haircut from a Kingston barber in the last few weeks to immediately contact their doctor or call the Ulster County COVID hotline at (845) 443-8888 to get tested for coronavirus.

The notice says there have been 1,533 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 62 deaths in Ulster County, which is located about 100 miles north of New York City.

Governor Cuomo spoke about the case during his Friday news briefing and said the barber was responsible for infecting other people.

""Barber in Kingston was operating in defiance of the close order, infected I think over a dozen people,"" Cuomo said. ""You know, that is a occupation of close proximity, right? You can't really socially distance and do a haircut … that is by definition an up-close-and-personal occupation.""

Cuomo said reopening barbershops and hair salons won't come until Phase 2 of the state's reopening plan, along with retail stores and other types of professional services, after health benchmarks are met.

This barber is only the latest small business owner in the country to make headlines for defying orders to close shop. Although the closure of non-essential businesses is seen by health officials as an effective measure to slow the spread of the virus and save lives, some residents argue it is not worth the financial burden.

In Texas, a salon owner was arrested earlier this month for ignoring cease and desist orders. Shelley Luther, who violated a stay-at-home order by keeping her Dallas-area salon open, was sentenced to jail time. A few days later, Texas Governor Greg Abbott modified his COVID-19 executive orders, effectively setting Luther free.

Similar incidents have occurred in other states, and groups of demonstrators have gathered in Michigan, North Carolina, Colorado and elsewhere to protest stay-a-home orders.

Many states have now begun loosening stay-at-home orders and opening up, including parts of New York, which will open by region and in phases depending on health conditions in each region.

Of the 10 regions in New York, five have met all seven metrics to begin Phase 1 of reopening Friday, May 15: Central New York, Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, North Country and the Southern Tier. Phase 1 will allow construction, agriculture, hunting and fishing, manufacturing, and curbside pick-up retail operations to resume.

For the vast majority of all New York state residents, a stay-at-home order that had been set to expire Friday will now remain in place until June 13, unless individual regions can meet specific criteria.

The lockdown has left America's cultural and commercial capital wondering what its future holds. While many European cities begin the process of reviving their economies, the Big Apple — America's coronavirus epicenter — remains shut as authorities fear sparking another wave of COVID-19 infections.

""I'm bored to tears,"" sprightly 80-year-old Rhoda Glass, who at this time of year would normally be bouncing between the several charities where she volunteers, told the AFP news agency. ""I'm just hoping we come back to a semblance of normal pretty soon.""

Nowhere near normal

That wish seems unlikely with Mayor Bill de Blasio saying NYC will have to wait until June before a decision can be made on when non-essential businesses, such as its world-renowned museums, can reopen.

Anthony Mason walks through New York City, transformed by the coronavirus pandemic

Sipping cocktails on a rooftop bar, seeing a concert in Madison Square Garden or being absorbed in the crowds of Times Square: activities symbolic of New York's status as a bustling, exciting metropolis seem unimaginable in the foreseeable future.

Beloved Broadway theaters have said they will not reopen until at least early September.

Leaders have warned New Yorkers that they may have to endure the city's notoriously sweltering summer months without access to its hugely popular beaches.

Authorities have already said swimming pools will remain closed and insist it is even too early to say whether schools will be allowed to open in September for the new academic year.

""We have to be smart,"" Governor Andrew Cuomo has said numerous times about reopening, pointing out that countries which eased restrictions too quickly had to shut down again after cases spiked.

Cuomo: ""We're all anxious to get back to work"" after peak of COVID-19 outbreak

COVID-19 is thought to have killed more than 20,000 New York City residents since it registered its first case in early March, representing almost a quarter of America's coronavirus deaths.

5 regions enter Phase One

Upwards of 700 New York state residents were dying every day at the height of the crisis last month. Numbers this week have been hovering around the 160-mark.

A handful of less-affected regions will start to reopen on Friday but they represent a small fraction of New York state's 20 million inhabitants.

The governor said Thursday that five regions upstate and in Central New York would begin Phase One of reopening on Friday, according to CBS News York. The others can only begin after hitting a series of benchmarks.

Earlier this week, Cuomo said New York City still needed to meet three more benchmarks before it's ready to reopen. Those benchmarks include a decline in the number of new hospitalizations and an increase in the total available hospital and ICU beds.

New York City is some way off meeting those Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for reopening which include a continuous 14-day decline in deaths and new cases.

Cuomo is committed to the criteria, even as other states reopen without meeting them.

While demonstrations against confinement measures have multiplied across the United States, New Yorkers have largely followed the orders, although sunnier weather has seen residents flock to parks in recent weeks.

""Sucks, but it is what it is.""

Despite emergency field hospitals having come down and sirens noticeably less frequent, residents required to wear masks outdoors and clapping for essential workers at 7:00 p.m. are daily reminders the crisis is far from over.

A recent spike in children becoming infected with a rare inflammatory syndrome similar to Kawasaki disease that scientists say is linked to COVID-19 has also reignited fears about the virus.

""Continuing the lockdown is the right decision. It really sucks, but it is what it is,"" 40-year-old trader Shelby, who declined to give her surname, told AFP.

The crisis has exposed inequalities in one of America's most diverse cities, with African-American and Latino communities dying in disproportionately large numbers.

It has also left hundreds of thousands of people unemployed and the city facing a multi-billion-dollar funding crisis that threatens a financial crisis not seen since the 1970s. That requires federal help.

New Yorkers concerned that the Big Apple might never be the same again take solace in the fact it has recovered from other tragedies, namely the 9/11 attacks and Hurricane Sandy.

In our series, ""Profiles in Service,"" we meet a group of veterans answering the call and bringing their skills to a different kind of frontline — in a different kind of battle.

Colonel Melissa Givens spent two decades as an emergency room physician in the U.S. Army.

""I'm getting choked up thinking about this, but you served 20 years in the military, and now you're retired, but you're still serving your country,"" CBS News' Norah O'Donnell told Givens.

""There's nothing I would rather do and I'm with the people I would choose to do it with for the rest of my life,"" Givens replied.

For Givens, it's about a life of service. In record time, she helped New York-Presbyterian Hospital transform an indoor soccer stadium into a field hospital for COVID-19 patients.

""What led you to this new mission?"" O'Donnell asked.

""I really felt the call to serve,"" Givens said. ""I'm a physician. I had skills I could offer.""

There was a critical need — over 200 beds — but how would they find doctors and nurses? Colonel Givens posted on social media. In 36 hours, over 800 veterans answered the call to serve.

""I'm actually overwhelmed at the response of these veterans and their willingness to leave their homes and their families and put themselves at risk,"" said Givens. ""But on the other hand, I'm not surprised at all. This is what veterans do, they have a calling to serve.""

Veterans like former flight medic Ricky Ditzel Jr., who left the U.S. Army two weeks ago.

""Most people don't race to the epicenter of a pandemic, but you did. Why?"" O'Donnell asked.

""I saw the opportunity to continue to serve and I figured a pandemic environment was very similar to an environment overseas,"" Ditzel explained.

The field hospital is named after Navy SEAL Ryan Larkin, a medic and sniper who served four tours in Iraq and Afghanistan.

""He was somebody who had a passion for serving and caring for patients, and we really wanted to honor his name,"" Givens said.

Colonel Givens now serves as the hospital's medical director. The head nurse and the hospital's chief operating officer are also women. ""It's felt good to have this — I would almost call it a sisterhood — as we try and solve hard problems,"" said Givens.

""What have you learned while you are there in New York at that field hospital?"" O'Donnell asked.

""I think it's just been reinforced in me just how good the human spirit is,"" Givens replied. ""If you put the call out, people will respond. They just need to know how to help and they're going to show up.""",100,High,Left-center

The elite pilots streaking low over New York and Philadelphia on Tuesday posed a striking thank you to front-line workers like Manhattan's Dr. Sarah Vossoughi, a clinical pathologist at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia.

""For them to show us that sign of respect and that sign of honor, for them to do that for us, that makes me feel really special, and it makes it worth it,"" Vossoughi said.

What you couldn't see overhead was the highly choreographed work that kept the fighters flying nonstop.

CBS News flew with pilots and airmen from the Air Force's 305th Air Mobility wing out of Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey.

The KC-10 Extender, an aerial refueler, one of four on this mission, took off with 300,000 pounds of fuel to help make it possible for the Thunderbirds and Blue Angels to fly Pensacola, Florida, to New York City and back without landing.

""It's a really huge opportunity for us to show our support for healthcare workers,"" Tech Sergeant Bryce Smith said between refueling F-16 fighters on the flight to New York. ""And this flyover is hopefully going to mean a lot for everybody so it's really nice.""

From the cockpit, we talked to the Thunderbirds, like Lieutenant Colonel John Caldwell.

When asked what he hoped front-line workers would take away from the display, Caldwell said, ""We want them to know that we're there, that we care, that we're in this together, we know this has been stressful, we know it has been hard, we know that they're struggling. We're supporting them, we're cheering for them, and we're so grateful for their service.""

For another Thunderbird, Major Trevor Aldridge, the low pass over Brooklyn was personal. Watching and waving from her rooftop was his sister-in-law Lily, a COVID-19 survivor.

""I hope that we can inspire, you know, all the frontline workers while they're going through the toughest part of this,"" he said. 'We're really, really excited to be able to do this for everybody.""

The teams are now planning more ""America Strong"" flyovers — an airborne show of thanks bearing the message, ""We're all in this together.""",100,High,Left-center
