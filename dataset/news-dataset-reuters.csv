Trump suspended U.S. contributions to the WHO last month, accusing it of promoting Chinese “disinformation” about the novel coronavirus outbreak, although WHO officials denied the accusation and China said it was transparent and open.

""If the WHO does not commit to major substantive improvements within the next 30 days, I will make my temporary freeze of United States funding to the WHO permanent and reconsider our membership,"" Trump told its chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, in a letter posted bit.ly/3bNB3R7 on Twitter.

Earlier, Trump said the Geneva-based WHO had “done a very sad job” in its handling of the coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year, and he would make a decision on funding soon.

Trump said in the letter the only way forward for the WHO was for it to demonstrate independence from China, adding that his administration had started discussing reform with Tedros.

Trump also made various accusations against China in the letter including that it tried to block evidence the virus could be transmitted between people, pressed the WHO not to declare it an emergency, refused to share data and samples and denied access to its scientists and facilities.

China hit back on Tuesday with its foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, saying the letter was slanderous.

“The U.S. leadership’s open letter is filled with phrases of suggestions, maybes, and potentialities, and is trying to mislead the public through this specious method, to achieve the goal of smearing and slandering China’s efforts in epidemic prevention and to shift responsibility in its own incompetence in handling the epidemic,” Zhao told a regular briefing.

Zhao said the U.S. decision to stop contributing to the WHO was a violation of its international obligations.

‘REVIEW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE’

A WHO spokeswoman in Geneva said on Tuesday the agency had no immediate comment on Trump’s letter but expected to have “more clarity” and a reaction to it later in the day.

On Monday, the WHO said an independent review of the global coronavirus response would begin as soon as possible and it had received backing and a hefty pledge of funds from China.

The WHO, a U.N. specialized agency, is leading a global initiative to develop safe and effective vaccines, tests and drugs to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.

More than 4.75 million people have been infected globally and 314,414 have died, according to a Reuters tally.

The United States contributed more than $400 million to the WHO in 2019, or about 15% of its budget.

This year, the United States has already paid the WHO about $58 million, senior Trump administration officials said last month, half of what it is required to pay for 2020 - known as an assessed contribution.

The United States traditionally provides several hundred million dollars annually in voluntary funding tied to specific WHO programmes like polio eradication, vaccine-preventable disease, HIV and hepatitis, tuberculosis, and maternal and child and health.

It was not clear how much voluntary funding the United States has provided for WHO programmes in 2020."

News of a possible vaccine breakthrough was somewhat overshadowed by President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement hours later that he is taking hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 preventive treatment, contrary to medical warnings about such use of the anti-malaria drug. The disclosure came during Trump’s White House meeting with restaurant executives.

“All I can tell you is so far I seem to be OK,” the president told reporters, saying he has taken a single dose of the drug each day for the past week and a half.

Just 10 days ago the White House confirmed that Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary had tested positive for the coronavirus, 24 hours after Trump’s military valet was diagnosed.

Trump initially promoted hydroxychloroquine in April as a potential COVID-19 treatment based on a positive report about its use against the virus. But subsequent studies have found it to be ineffective, and the Food and Drug Administration has warned of the potential for serious side effects associated with hydroxychloroquine and an older, related drug, chloroquine.

VACCINE HOPE

Earlier in the day came word that a COVID-19 vaccine under development by Massachusetts-based biotech firm Moderna Inc had produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers during a safety trial launched in March.

The findings, offering a glimmer of hope that the experimental vaccine may ultimately prove effective, sent Moderna’s shares soaring 20% on Monday and helped lift the overall stock market about 3% to a 10-week high.

Until a vaccine or cure can be found, lockdowns on commerce and social gatherings remain the chief weapon for fighting the pandemic, even while ravaging the U.S. economy.

Public health experts caution that easing stay-at-home orders and mandatory business closures is still risky while diagnostic testing remains scant in many places, leaving in doubt how much virus lurks undetected.

Although nearly all 50 states have begun reopening, only 13 had met federal guidelines for safely lifting restrictions as of Sunday, according to a Reuters analysis, raising concerns that infections and deaths could surge anew.

While some consumers have voiced hesitancy about returning to shopping malls and restaurants just yet, others were clearly ready to do so.

“We need to get the economy going again. People are either out of money or will be very soon,” said Martin Bermudez, 48, as he and a companion enjoyed ham-and-cheese omelets at a cafe in Miami.

They were among the first diners back in the eatery for sit-down table service after more than two months of takeout only.

The pandemic has afflicted the United States more than any other country, with more than 1.5 million known infections and nearly 90,000 deaths.

A revision to an influential coronavirus mortality model periodically updated by University of Washington researchers predicted on Monday that 143,357 Americans will die from COVID-19 by early August, about 3,600 fewer than last projected.

The slightly more optimistic forecast reflects greater-than-expected adherence to social distancing and face covering by the public, Dr. Christopher Murray, head of the university’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told CNN.

New York state, epicenter of the U.S. pandemic with 27,400 COVID-19 deaths to date, registered further evidence of improvement as its three-day rolling average of hospitalizations and tally of newly reported fatalities both declined.

FROM SPORTS TO ASSEMBLY LINES

In a sign of growing confidence in curbing the contagion, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo said he was looking forward to professional sports teams to begin competing again, though without fans in attendance.

California Governor Gavin Newsom likewise said his state has been in talks with officials of all major sports leagues about a possible fan-free resumption of play. He added that a possible June 1 opening day would depend on development of new safety standards and the prevailing infection rates in California.

In the San Francisco Bay area, health directors in five counties said manufacturing, retail with curbside pickup and warehouse distribution could reopen, catching up with a similar loosening of restrictions elsewhere across the state 10 days earlier.

In the Midwest, the U.S. auto industry slowly returned to life from a two-month lockdown as the Detroit Three carmakers and their suppliers began restarting assembly lines in a sector that employs nearly 1 million people.

Hundreds of workers at Fiat Chrysler Automobile’s (FCA) truck plant in Warren, Michigan, began lining up before dawn for the early shift. Signs overhead read: “Let’s restart.”

The auto industry is widely watched as a test case for whether workers across a range of U.S. industries can safely return to factory floors.

“I’m a little nervous,” said Larry Smith, 53, who works on wheel alignment away from the assembly line. “They made all the precautions (and) they’ve done everything they can to prepare .... I’m trusting in God.”

Trump volunteered the disclosure during a question-and-answer session with reporters at the White House as he met restaurant executives whose businesses are reeling from the impact of the virus.

“I’m taking hydroxychloroquine,” Trump said. “I’ve been taking it for the last week and a half. A pill every day.”

Weeks ago, Trump had promoted the drug as a potential treatment based on a positive report about its use against the virus, but subsequent studies found that it was not helpful. The Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about its use.

In an April 24 statement, the FDA said it was “aware of reports of serious heart rhythm problems” in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine or an older drug, chloroquine.

Trump, 73, who is tested daily for the virus, said he had asked the White House physician if it was OK to take the drug, and the doctor told him: “Well, if you’d like it.”

The president, a well-known germaphobe, has nonetheless refused to wear a protective mask in the West Wing.

White House physician Sean Conley said in a memo that Trump was in “very good health” and had been receiving regular COVID-19 testing, which has all been negative since one of his support staff tested positive for the disease two weeks ago.

“After numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relative risks,” Conley said in the memo released by the White House.

‘RECKLESS’

Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, asked on CNN about Trump’s taking the drug, said: “He’s our president. I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and his, shall we say weight group what is morbidly obese, they say.”

According to the results of an annual presidential physical examination conducted in February 2019, Trump had gained weight over the past year and was now in the obese range, although remaining in “very good health overall.” reut.rs/3bGMCtl

Morbid obesity is generally defined as a body mass index (BMI) - a measure of weight relative to height - of 40 or higher. A BMI of 25 to 29.9 is overweight and 30 or above is obese.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in an MSNBC interview that what Trump did with hydroxychloroquine was “reckless” and was giving people “false hope.”

Trump’s disclosure came as Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) reported progress in a potential vaccine for the virus. The only drug that has emerged so far as a potential treatment is Gilead Sciences Inc’s (GILD.O) remdesivir.

Fox News Channel, immediately after Trump’s remarks, interviewed Dr. Bob Lahita, chairman of medicine at St. Joseph University Hospital in New Jersey, who cautioned people not to take hydroxychloroquine.

“There’s no effect that we have seen and we have treated multiple patients with it,” he said.

Trump said he also took a single dose of azithromycin, an antibiotic meant to prevent infection. In conjunction with hydroxychloroquine, Trump said he was taking zinc.

“All I can tell you is so far I seem to be OK,” he said."

The CDC study, expected to launch in June or July, will test samples from blood donors in 25 metropolitan areas for antibodies created when the immune system fights the coronavirus, said Dr. Michael Busch, director of the nonprofit Vitalant Research Institute.

Busch is leading a preliminary version of the study - funded by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases - that is testing the first 36,000 samples.

The CDC-funded portion, to be formally announced this week, will expand the scope and time frame, taking samples over 18 months to see how antibodies evolve over time, said CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund.

Vitalant, a nonprofit that runs blood donation centers and tests samples, will lead the broader effort as well.

Researchers aim to publish results on a rolling basis, Nordlund said.

Antibody studies, also known as seroprevalence research, are considered critical to understanding where an outbreak is spreading and can help guide decisions on restrictions needed to contain it.

The CDC study should also help scientists better understand whether the immune response to COVID wanes over time.

The novel coronavirus has infected around 1.5 million people in the United States and killed nearly 90,000, according to a Reuters tally.

The CDC study will test blood from 1,000 donors in each of the 25 metro areas monthly, for 12 months. Researchers will then test blood from another 25,000 donors at the 18-month mark. Samples will come from “regular, altruistic people” who come in to donate blood, Busch said.

‘FEELING EXPOSED’

Some public health officials have complained that the CDC has lagged on research and guidance for local governments trying to cope with the pandemic. “We’re feeling exposed at the local level, in terms of not seeing that kind of organized plan from CDC,” Dr. Matt Willis, public health officer for Marin County, California, said in an interview last week.

News of the study brought Willis some reassurance. “Partial answers and preliminary results are better than nothing when you have a decision to make” that could affect lives, he said, like when to reopen parks and businesses.

The CDC’s Nordlund said the study “is indicative of how leaders across the federal government are working collaboratively with partners in academia and in blood donation and testing industries” to monitor COVID-19.

She added that blood donor results can be used by CDC to form estimates about the broader population through statistical methods. “This has been done with West Nile virus, Zika, and other emerging infectious diseases,” she said.

The six metropolitan areas being surveyed in the precursor study are New York, Seattle, the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Boston and Minneapolis, said Dr. Graham Simmons, another Vitalant researcher involved in the project. “In all likelihood” the next phase will add Miami, Atlanta, New Orleans, Dallas, St. Louis, Chicago, Denver and others, Simmons said.

“We have selected sites to give a broad geographical distribution throughout the country,” Simmons said, including sites with high infection rates or places where rates may increase.

Researchers at John Hopkins University, in a 2019 paper, found blood donors, who are disproportionately healthy, are not always ideal populations for research. (bit.ly/2LDtz910)

The CDC study may not “generate results that are generalizable to the population,” Thomas McDade, a researcher at Northwestern University, said in an interview.

Still, it could “substantially add to our understanding of (COVID-19) infections,” said Dr. Susan Philip, deputy health officer at the San Francisco Department of Public Health.

“It will be a large sample size, geographically diverse … and quick to set up,” Philip added.

Some local governments have done their own seroprevalence research. New York in April found antibodies in more than 20% of some 3,000 test subjects, suggesting the number of residents exposed to the virus in the hardest-hit state is much higher than the 355,000 who have tested positive.

Last week, an antibody study by the city of Boston and Massachusetts General Hospital found 10% of the population had COVID-19 antibodies. The Spanish government ran a study showing exposure in 5% of people - suggesting 10 times the number of confirmed positive cases."

On the economy, “medical metrics” rule for now

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will testify on Tuesday before the Senate Banking Committee and face questions about their plans keep the world’s largest economy afloat and missteps in rolling out some $3 trillion in aid so far.

Two months into the pandemic, many analysts have concluded that U.S. policy has at best fought back worst-case outcomes on both the health and economic front.

Powell has said he sees the likely need for up to six more months of government financial help for firms and families. With regular data on the economy at best volatile and at worst outdated when it comes out, he said “medical metrics” were the most important signs to watch right now.

The presidential pill

Donald Trump surprised many on Monday by revealing that he is taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventative medicine against the coronavirus - despite warnings about the malaria drug.

“I’ve been taking it for the last week and a half. A pill every day,” he told reporters. “All I can tell you is so far I seem to be OK.”

Weeks ago Trump had promoted the drug as a potential treatment based on a positive report about its use against the virus, but subsequent studies found it was not helpful. The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning about it.

Glimmer of hope

That overshadowed news that an experimental COVID-19 vaccine made by Moderna Inc produced protective antibodies in a small group of healthy volunteers, according to very early data released by the biotech company on Monday.

The vaccine has the green light to start the second stage of human testing. In this Phase II trial to test effectiveness and find the optimal dose, Moderna said it will drop plans to test a 250 mcg dose and test a 50 mcg dose instead.

Reducing the dose required to produce immunity could help spare the amount of vaccine required in each shot, meaning the company could produce more of the vaccine.

Eating with your mask on

Israeli inventors have developed a mask with a remote control mouth that lets diners eat without taking it off, which they say could make a visit to a restaurant less risky.

A squeeze of a lever opens a slot in the front of the mask so food can pass through.

The process could get messy with ice cream or sauces, but more solid morsels can be gobbled up a la Pac-Man in the arcade game."

As the coronavirus permanently shutters some small businesses, big fast-food brands like Domino’s Pizza, Chipotle and Wendy’s that were doing well before the crisis want to grow - or continue pre-existing expansion plans - after the pandemic subsides.

David Deno, chief executive officer of Outback Steakhouse parent company Bloomin’ Brands, told Reuters in an interview that “I don’t mean to wish ill on anybody, but there’s going to be real estate opportunities,” for new stores or relocations to areas with “better visibility, better access and better parking.”

Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc (CMG.N), Taco Bell owner Yum! Brands Inc (YUM.N), and Domino’s Pizza Inc (DPZ.N) are among several household names planning post-pandemic growth, according to their CEOs.

“Brands that are doing well in this environment should have an opportunity to expand their footprint,” said David Gibbs, Yum chief executive officer, in an earnings call in late April. “There’s no reason to think that this brand… is not going to be a growth business long term. And unit development is a big part of that.”

In the month of April, retail properties collected less rent than other real estate sectors, according to a Citi note on Friday after a week of real estate investment trusts’ earnings reports.

Malls collected only 28% of rents and shopping centers 60%, among other commercial property declines, Citi found.

“It’s really a time of opportunity for these firms to entrench themselves into where they want to be,” said Susan Wachter, professor of real estate finance at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. “The retail landscape is going to be open for redeployment and for expansion of the firms whose market share is growing.”

“You are going to have a location reshuffle based on the tenants that offer what people will want post-COVID,” said Scott Crowe of the real estate investment firm CenterSquare Investment Management, including the ability to spend less time inside and lower prices.

Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) and McDonald’s Corp (MCD.N) could also be among those that grow, said Neuberger Berman analyst Kevin McCarthy.

“We’re in a period of a few years where independents lose and chains gain” as much as 10% to 15% of market share, McCarthy said of the restaurant industry. The winners of that share grab will be those models centered around convenience and accessibility.

“It was a trend going 30 miles an hour, now accelerated to 100 miles an hour,” McCarthy said. “It’s corporate Darwinism on steroids.”

There is precedent for fast-food expansion in the face of crisis. In 2010, Burger King was able to grow its brand in Western Europe at the tail end of the financial crisis.

“These were some of the best years we had… in Western Europe with many of our developing partners because there is tremendous opportunity,” said Jose Cil, chief executive officer of Restaurant Brands International Inc (QSR.TO), parent company of Burger King and Popeyes, in a May 1 earnings call.

“Our business works in almost any environment,” Cil told Reuters, adding that it is positioned to capture market share in Europe, Asia, the United States and Canada. “We’re very excited and bullish long term.”

To be sure, the path to expansion could be choppy. Sales plunged in late March and April, leading many corporations to drop their financial forecasts and stop construction projects to save capital costs.

Even if they wanted to keep building, permitting has been temporarily halted in many places.

Occupancy restrictions will make reopening dining rooms tricky, and some restaurants may eventually change their floorplans to adapt to a new way of dining out.

Nonetheless, Shake Shack Inc (SHAK.N) CEO Randy Garutti said during a May 4 earnings call that “as additional real estate and development opportunities become available, we’ll be ready to capture the white space ahead.”

Wendy’s Co (WEN.O), Papa John’s International Inc (PZZA.O) and Yum China Holdings Inc (YUMC.N) also discussed post-coronavirus expansion during recent Wall Street calls.

“If there’s opportunities that make sense for us on the real estate side, we will pursue those,” said David Hoffmann, Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc (DNKN.O) chief executive officer in an April 30 earnings call. “But you also want to balance being a good corporate citizen and sticking to your values, and not being a shark either.”"

Senators are expected to grill Mnuchin and Powell about actions still needed to keep the world's largest economy afloat and about missteps in rolling out some $3 trillion in aid so far. (See graphic here showing how the money moved.)

As more states reopen businesses, the government is closing in on the end of an eight-week program to funnel money to small businesses to avoid layoffs, prompting calls to extend the $660 billion Paycheck Protection Program. President Donald Trump said on Monday that such an extension “should be easy.”

Other programs aimed at helping larger companies and municipal bond issuers through a sharp recession are just getting started, and Powell and Mnuchin may provide details on their application at the hearing scheduled for 10 a.m. (1400 GMT).

Powell said in prepared remarks for the hearing released on Monday that the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act was “critical” to the U.S. central bank’s ability to expand credit throughout the economy to offset the blow from the coronavirus.

In remarks broadcast on Sunday night, Powell said unemployment may hit 25% before it begins to fall, with a contraction in gross domestic product of 20% or more. He added that positive “medical metrics” that can build consumer confidence would be critical.

Senators are also likely to try to elicit the two officials’ views on another $3 trillion aid bill crafted by House of Representatives Democrats that narrowly passed that chamber on Friday. The measure is opposed by Senate Republicans as negotiations continue between the two parties and the Trump administration.

Before the hearing, Mnuchin is scheduled to meet with Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy at the U.S. Capitol, according to the White House.

Mnuchin also will face questions by the Senate banking panel over processing glitches that held up small-business loan applications as the Paycheck Protection Program was rushed into service in early April, as well as on abrupt policy changes that required many larger, publicly traded restaurant chains with access to capital markets to return their funds under the threat of audits.

A separate congressional oversight board issued its first report here on the response, consisting largely of questions that could be asked in Tuesday's hearing.

Among them are how the agencies will measure success and isolate the effects of the measures from other state and federal efforts."

(Reuters) - Southwest Airlines Co (LUV.N) said on Tuesday it recorded positive bookings on a net basis so far this month as passenger reservations outpaced trip cancellations, helping the company slow its cash burn rate.

Airlines have been the among the worst hit by the coronavirus crisis, which brought travel to a virtual standstill around the world.

Southwest said although it continues to estimate its average daily core cash spending to be in range of $30 million to $35 million in the second quarter, June daily cash burn rate would slow to low-$20 million range.

“The company has also recently experienced a modest improvement in passenger demand and bookings in June 2020,” Southwest said in a regulatory filing.

The U.S. carrier said it expects June capacity to fall between 45% and 55% from with a year ago, compared with a decline of 60% to 70% in May capacity. (bit.ly/3cK8UvT)"

(Reuters) - Kohl’s Corp (KSS.N) reported a bigger-than-expected loss on Tuesday, as the department store chain’s stores remained shut for most of the first quarter due to the COVID-19 lockdowns.

The company had earlier withdrawn its full-year forecast, suspended share buyback plan and borrowed money to combat the pandemic’s impact. The company said it ended the quarter with $2 billion in cash at hand.

The results come at a time peers when J.Crew, Neiman Marcus and J.C. Penney (JCP.N) have filed for bankruptcy protection due to huge losses.

Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin-based Kohl’s was forced to close all its stores in the United States to curb the spread of the coronavirus. The company is now reopening some stores across the country, while online operations remain open.

Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said the company has reopened about 50% of its U.S. stores.

Kohl’s said net sales fell to $2.16 billion from $3.82 billion a year earlier.

For the quarter ended May 2, the company reported net loss of $541 million, or $3.50 per share, compared with a profit of $62 million, or 38 cents per share, a year earlier.

Excluding one-time items, it lost $3.20 per share, missing Wall Street estimates of a $1.80 loss, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

LONDON (Reuters) - Asda, the British supermarket arm of the world’s biggest retailer Walmart (WMT.N), said on Tuesday its first-quarter comparable sales rose 3.5%, boosted by consumers stocking-up on food in response to the coronavirus crisis.

It said higher growth in food was partially offset by weaker demand for apparel.

Asda also said it gross profit rate declined, primarily as a result of a change in mix towards lower margin categories in response to COVID-19. It also had incremental costs related to the pandemic."

As with many other families from Zimbabwe whose members depend on food from South Africa, the supplies were abruptly halted when the two countries restricted movement across their border in March to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

“I was confused and did not know what to do,” said Mabhena, 53, who sends food to her mother and daughter.

A friend told her about an app that lets people in South Africa order groceries for delivery in Zimbabwe, where prices for food and other essentials have soared amid a severe economic crisis.

Use of the app called Malaicha - Ndebele slang for the traditional way of sending goods over the border with bus and taxi drivers - surged in April, said its managing director, Sayjil Magan.

While the border has been closed to people and the taxis and buses that would normally ferry food informally, Malaicha is permitted to import goods into Zimbabwe, offering an alternative.

About a year old, the app has yet to break even, in part because its costs, including trucks and warehousing, are higher than the typical digital startup.

But if its user base continues to grow, it could emerge as a rare winner from South Africa’s lockdown, one of the world’s most restrictive.

Previously, Malaicha handled an average of 20,000 to 30,000 orders a month, Magan said, but that number increased by around 200% month-on-month in April, while user numbers grew by around 100% to 75,000.

“It’s something they are going to carry on using; that’s the feedback that we are getting from our customers,” Magan said.

In Zimbabwe’s capital Harare, one of five major cities where Malaicha operates, deliveries reached 200 a day in April, from an average of 20 before the lockdown, said warehouse manager Mario Ventouris.

Workers were putting in extra hours to clear long lines of people who had come to collect orders, he added.

Delivery driver Decide Sabamba said his job was tougher than before: “It’s busy, it’s busy every day.”

He brought cooking oil and diapers to Mabhena’s daughter, Epiphania Moyo, and her baby - their first delivery via the app.

The family is all too familiar with the frustration of traditional malaicha deliveries, which they said cost more and don’t always arrive on time or in full. Their experience with the app was different.

“They are very fast; they delivered everything. I will use it again,” Moyo added."

MADRID (Reuters) - Spain lifted on Tuesday a ban on direct flights and ships from Italy imposed since March 11 to curb the coronavirus, but tourism restrictions and a 14-day quarantine for inbound travellers remained in place.

A much-reduced death rate from COVID-19 has encouraged Spain to begin easing one of Europe’s strictest lockdowns, but the tourism-dependent economy is likely to have to wait until late June to welcome holidaymakers back.

Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez is preparing to ask parliament to extend until late June a state of emergency which has helped limit infections but also brought unprecedented restrictions on borders and movement, causing huge economic damage.

Cadena Ser radio reported that cabinet would use a meeting on Tuesday to discuss an extension until June 27. A government spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.

At the peak of the outbreak, Spain was losing hundreds of citizens a day as stretched hospitals and care homes struggled to treat patients.

But the overnight death toll reported on Monday was 59, the lowest in two months, bringing the known total to 27,709.

The United States, United Kingdom, Italy and France have all reported more fatalities than Spain."

UNITED STATES

There are no government-imposed measures in the United States, though all major U.S. airlines require face coverings and several are capping the number of seats sold or leaving middle seats empty. Many airports are also requiring face coverings. Major U.S. airlines have also endorsed temperature checks at airports by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, which so far has implemented safety measures such as increased spacing in security checkpoint queues.

EUROPEAN UNION AND UNITED KINGDOM

The European Commission last week proposed airlines and airports require passengers to wear masks, and reorganise check-ins, dropoffs and luggage pickups to avoid crowds. Travellers should keep luggage and movement in the cabin to a minimum. The guidelines are not binding, but they may help form a framework in the bloc as restrictions are lifted. The United Kingdom is observing E.U. trade and travel regulations until the end of 2020.

CHINA

The aviation regulator is requiring extra ventilation and sterilisation of airplanes and airports. Passengers are required to fill out an electronic health declaration before boarding and are asked to sit apart from each other onboard if possible. Temperature checks are required for every passenger and workers like cabin crew and security officers are offered protective gear. Passengers need to wear a mask throughout the flight.

JAPAN

The government has directed airlines to make in-flight announcements about health measures and to distribute health information cards and questionnaires. It has also asked airport staff to wear masks, but they are not mandatory for passengers. There is no requirement to keep the middle seat empty.

SOUTH KOREA

The aviation regulator is requiring travellers’ temperatures be checked in the airport. Airport authorities ask travellers to stand at least 1 metre (3 ft) apart in line, and are furnished with hand sanitiser. Korean Air Lines Co Ltd (003490.KS) is seating passengers as far apart as possible, conducting additional temperature checks on international travellers and requiring all domestic passengers to wear masks, with a few exceptions such as children under 2 years.

QATAR

At the airport, staff and passengers are required to pass temperature checks and disinfection procedures, with high contact areas disinfected every 10 to 15 minutes. Qatar Airways is encouraging social distancing on board when possible, especially on flights with lighter loads, and will require passengers to wear masks.

MALAYSIA

The government is requiring airlines carry a maximum of half the usual number of passengers on board, with some exceptions on flights between peninsular Malaysia and states in Borneo. At the airport, passengers must remain 1 metre apart from each other for social distancing, including markers in queues. Malaysia Airlines requires passengers to wear masks onboard.

INDONESIA

Airlines can only carry half the usual number of passengers as part of government requirements to leave 1 metre between them. Air crew are required to take the temperature of passengers 30 minutes before landing. Passengers must wear masks and fill in a health awareness card.

THAILAND

The aviation regulator requires airlines to leave at least one seat empty between passengers, who are required to wear surgical masks onboard. No food and beverages will be served during flights and passengers are not allowed to eat or drink. In an event of emergency, the cabin crew may provide water.

PHILIPPINES

The government requires passengers to wear masks upon entering the airport, mandatory temperature checks and for social distancing measures to be observed at queuing points. Security screenings should be done with minimal contact. Passengers need to fill out an electronic health declaration form."

In Malaysia and Indonesia, the plane needs to be half-empty. In the United States and Europe, it’s not mandatory for airlines to leave the middle seat open.

Measures to stem the spread of coronavirus have changed how people travel, as Beijing resident Feng Xueli, 26, found when she took a domestic flight this month. The aircraft was full - allowed under the Chinese rules.

“We needed to wear a mask during the flight and there were PA announcements basically asking for our cooperation with these anti-virus measures put in place, which made me a bit nervous,” Feng said. “You also need to go through a lot of temperature checks and security checks when you leave the airport.”

Travellers, airlines and airports are grappling with a hodgepodge of rules put in place during the pandemic that will make flying different in almost every country.

“When flying restarts, you are already working against the clock. There is still a latent fear of travel,” said Subhas Menon, head of the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. “It’s not going to be such a smooth passage when you travel because of all of the measures that are going to be introduced.”

A little more than a year after uneven national responses to the grounding of the Boeing (BA.N) 737 MAX, the industry is once again facing piecemeal regulation.

The last trigger for such widespread changes in the way airlines operate was the 2001 attacks in the United States, which ushered in new security measures.

“People globally have understood the security requirements that came after 9/11. We would like to see that kind of standardisation of protocols,” said Boeing vice-president Mike Delaney, leader of Boeing’s Confident Travel Initiative.

Onboard service is changing too. Business-class meals, once a selling point for premium carriers hiring celebrity chefs, have been reduced to pre-packaged items on carriers including Emirates, Air Canada (AC.TO) and British Airways.

Automation is also increasing, as carriers such as Qantas Airways Ltd (QAN.AX) ask passengers to check in online to limit contact with staff and other fliers.

“More than ever, the industry will work towards the vision of an entirely mobile-enabled journey,” said Sumesh Patel of technology provider SITA, which hopes to benefit from the trend.

EMPTY MIDDLE SEAT?

On the airplane, one of the biggest debates has been over whether middle seats should be empty.

That would limit airplanes to two-thirds of their normal capacity, not enough for most airlines to make a profit without increasing fares.

Afif Zakwan, 20, recently took a Malaysia Airlines domestic flight that was exempt from the requirement to fly half-empty.

He said he was comfortable being on a full domestic flight, but would not consider flying internationally for now.

“As more and more people travel for whatever reason, confidence and the power of word of mouth experiences will shape the... recovery,” said Mayur Patel of data firm OAG Aviation.

An official at the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau said the issue of an open middle seat, which could create unfair advantages if applied unevenly, was “controversial”.

“It’s crucial that countries where flights depart coordinate their responses with countries where they arrive,” said the official, who was not authorised to speak publicly.

Despite the call for common standards, some nations are applying their rules just to airlines registered in their country, while others are applying them to foreign carriers.

U.S. carriers are among those requiring passengers and crew to wear facial coverings, and have also endorsed temperature checks.

In Europe, airlines are largely resisting calls to leave the middle seat empty but have publicised other changes designed to reassure passengers.

“You have to remember an aircraft is not the natural place to do social-distancing, so you need to mitigate the health risks by other means, and facial masks are a good example of those means,” Finnair Plc (FIA1S.HE) Chief Executive Topi Manner told Reuters."

HANOI (Reuters) - A free trade agreement with the European Union set to soon be ratified by Vietnam should boost the Asian nation’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the World Bank said on Tuesday, while urging faster reforms.

Vietnam’s legislature is expected to give its final approval later this month for a deal that would see tariff reductions on 99% of goods traded with the bloc, its second-largest export market after the United States.

Its trade minister has said he expects the agreement to take effect in July.

Vietnam’s economy grew at its slowest pace in the first quarter of this year, 3.8%, as the coronavirus outbreak hit output. But with just 324 cases and no deaths, Vietnam is set to resume economic activity sooner than its regional peers.

The European Union-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) could boost Vietnam’s GDP and exports by 2.4% and 12% respectively over the next decade and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty, the World Bank said in a report.

“Such benefits are particularly urgent to lock in positive economic gains as the country responds to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the bank said.

It said now was the perfect time for Vietnam to initiate deeper reforms and fix legal gaps and implementation issues to reap the full benefits of the agreement."

The U.S. Treasury Department offered amnesty to public companies that return money they borrowed by May 18, saying it would deem they made the application in good faith due to economic uncertainty fueled by the coronavirus outbreak, before guidelines were clarified.

The country’s energy sector has been clamoring for government aid in the wake of plummeting oil prices that have driven several debt-laden exploration and production companies into bankruptcy.

While President Donald Trump said last month his administration would formulate a plan to help the oil and gas industry, no specific aid has been announced. This has left energy companies to seek relief under the broader $2.3 trillion U.S. stimulus package.

One aspect of the latter that has been used by oil and gas firms is the so-called Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) for small businesses, providing loans that can be forgiven to cover payroll expenses, as well as mortgage interest, rent and utility costs.

Denver-based exploration and production company PDC Energy Inc (PDCE.O), which has a market capitalization of $1.3 billion, said on May 8 it had returned its $10 million PPP loan.

Natural Gas Services Group (NGS.N) also returned its $4.6 million PPP loan. Its chief executive, Stephen Taylor, said the Midland, Texas-based compression equipment provider had to cut 20% of its workforce after it returned the funds.

Public companies and their employees were being “discriminated against” by a “politically driven process”, Taylor told analysts during the company’s first-quarter earnings call on May 7.

Dawson Geophysical Co (DWSN.O) returned its $6.4 million PPP loan last week, the company said in a May 14 filing. Midland-based Dawson, which produces seismic data for oil and gas firms, cited “an abundance of caution” and new guidance for the decision.

Among those receiving loans, but which had not disclosed whether they would return the funds as of Monday, included Calumet Specialty Products (CLMT.O). The Indianapolis-based refiner received $31.4 million through five PPP applications.

Exploration firms Amplify Energy Corp (AMPY.N) and Battalion Oil Corp BATL.A received $5.5 million and $2.2 million respectively. Houston-based onshore driller Independence Contract Drilling (ICD.N) gained a $10 million PPP loan.

The quartet, along with the other five listed oil and gas firms that received PPP loans, did not respond to requests for comment.

Energy companies have also benefited from emergency tax reform enacted in the wake of the pandemic.

More than $2 billion of benefits were recorded by a combined 43 companies due to two changes in the tax code, including one allowing current losses to be offset against past income tax bills, a Reuters review of first-quarter earnings statements found."

The move is part of a longer-term bet that CEO Ed Bastian highlighted to investors last month: that consumers’ perceptions of safety will be instrumental in reviving more routine travel, and that they will be willing to pay a premium for comfort.

Specific details could still change, the people said on condition of anonymity, citing the uncertain timing of a recovery from the coronavirus crisis that has decimated air travel demand.

Delta has publicly said that it will limit first class seating capacity at 50% and main cabin at 60% through June 30, and earlier announced that it was resuming some flights next month.

“We announced a policy on seating capacity through June 30. Nothing has been decided beyond that but we are continuing to monitor the situation and make adjustments as necessary,” Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said.

Social distancing on airplanes has become a topic of debate. The global industry’s main group IATA has said that airlines will not be able to make a profit if they limit airplanes to two-thirds of their normal capacity, unless they drastically increased airfares.

In the United States, the chairman of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee last week urged airlines to maintain at least one seat between all passengers and cap seating at 67% of capacity on narrow-body airplanes.

While major U.S. airlines’ middle seat policies differ, they all require passengers to wear facial coverings, and they have all slashed their flying schedules by as much as 90% in an effort to stem a cash bleed amid withering demand.

Still, Bastian said on a quarterly investor call that fewer airplanes in the skies could be an “opportunity for us to focus more on a more premium experience.”

Industrywide, U.S. airline load factors have recently been about 33%, with some airlines reporting load factors in the 40% range as passenger traffic inches off historic lows. But it is still down about 90% over 2019 levels.

Adding more flights could bring in more revenues but also costs. Delta, which does not expect air travel to recover for two or three years, has said it aims to halve its daily cash burn to $50 million in June.

In an effort to reassure passengers, U.S. airlines have also intensified cabin cleaning protocols, in many cases using electrostatic cleaning and fogging procedures. They have also endorsed temperature screenings by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA), though this has yet to be implemented."

James Dean starrer “East of Eden” (1955), crime drama “Bonnie and Clyde” (1969) and disaster film “The Towering Inferno” (1974) are among other titles playing, after Japanese chain Toho Cinemas reopened 10 of its 66 theatres in areas deemed relatively safe from the coronavirus.

The unit of Toho Co, which also runs a film studio, said it would reopen 23 more cinemas on Friday in prefectures where the government has lifted the state of emergency.

Cinemas in Tokyo remain shut.

Toho Cinemas, which had closed all of its theatres as of April 18, has implemented safety measures including keeping every other seat empty and making staff and customers wear masks.

Reopening theatres leads to another challenge, however: what films to show after movie studios delayed new releases because of the pandemic?

Toho’s reopened theatres mostly offer a mix of old Hollywood, recent Japanese hits and holdovers like Oscar-winning “Parasite” that were in cinemas before the closures, although that mix varied between theatres, its website showed.

Its Sendai cinema in northern Japan on Tuesday was screening the American classics mentioned as well as neo-noir sci-fi classic “Blade Runner” (1982), prison drama “The Shawshank Redemption” (1994) and several Japanese films including “Shin Godzilla” (2016).

Its Sun Street Hamakita theatre in central Japan’s Shizuoka skewed more towards local films headlined by multiple screenings of Makoto Shinkai’s animation megahit “Your Name” (2016) and his follow-up “Weathering With You” (2019).

But Sun Street Hamakita was also showing Steven Spielberg’s sci-fi classic “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” (1982), romantic drama “An Officer and a Gentleman” (1982) and musical “West Side Story” (1961).

Jungkook, the BTS’ main vocalist, visited a restaurant and a bar in the Itaewon neighbourhood with friends on April 25, the boyband’s management Big Hit Entertainment said on Monday.

A new cluster of virus cases emerged in that neighbourhood this month as social distancing measures eased on May 6, prompting authorities to delay school reopening and close bars and clubs again.

“We have no excuse that we placed the artist’s personal life before we were able to emphasise the importance of social distancing. We bow our head in apology,” the company said.

The 22-year old, who was there before the first case among Itaewon clubgoers was confirmed, is not showing any symptoms and has tested negative for the coronavirus, Big Hit said.

“He is also deeply regretting on how he did not follow social distancing measures seriously.”

South Korea has been lauded for its quick and effective response to the pandemic but the resurgence of cases has raised concerns about a second wave of infections here

Before the rules were eased on May 6, authorities had allowed clubs and bars to stay open as long as they complied with strict social distancing measures, while advising people not to visit them.

Local media reported three other boy band members were with Jungkook during that outing, including Cha Eun-woo of Astro, Mingyu of Seventeen and Jaehyun of NCT.

The managers of all three issued statements confirming they were in Itaewon on the same day as Jungkook, apologising for their failure to follow social distancing measures. Jaehyun posted a handwritten apology on social media.

As of Monday, 170 cases have been traced to the Itaewon outbreak, with several hundreds in self isolation, according to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

BEIJING (Reuters) - Adorned with intricate designs of orchids, camellias and Chinese characters symbolising good luck, the stylish silk masks created by Chinese fashion designer Zhou Li have become coveted items during the coronavirus outbreak.

Zhou, whose Dejin fashion brand recently exhibited at China Fashion Week, has been making embroidered silk masks equipped with high specification N95 air filters since February, providing the fashion-conscious with protective options.

“When the situation turned very serious, we saw that many people needed to change their masks every four hours,” said Zhou, explaining how she came up with the idea for the reusable masks made from colourful Chinese silk.

Now, as China and other countries lift restrictions, Zhou expects masks will be a necessity for the foreseeable future. She has adapted hers for summer, making them with a thinner silk that allows for better breathability in warmer weather.

The 55-year-old, who is director of design at Shandong Sunbird Garment company, enjoys adding traditional Chinese motifs to her work.

A yellow mask displayed at a workshop in Beijing’s art district is decorated with golden orchids, representing a harmonious family with abundant wealth and many children.

Zhou is also designing personal protective suits, many also featuring flowers, after her friends asked for stylish outer wear to use during air travel.

The company can make around 600 masks a day, and sells them online at 118 yuan ($16) a piece. Zhou plans to market them by inviting influencers to participate in live-streaming on e-commerce platforms, and hopes to expand sales in England and Italy.

“I hope people can wear my masks that protect them, make them look beautiful, bring them good luck and keep them safe,” she said."

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton

While Warren, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts and prominent voice on the Democratic Party’s left, criticized the former vice president’s approach on the campaign trail before dropping out and endorsing him, Biden advisers said the two see eye-to-eye on a number of issues.

In recent weeks, for example, Biden has endorsed Warren-backed ideas like canceling some student debt to help financially strapped Americans and echoed her calls for “structural change” in an economy ravaged by the pandemic.

Biden is poised to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. Warren is thought to be on Biden’s short list of possible vice presidential running mates along with Senators Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar, among others. A decision is not expected for weeks.

Warren and Biden have held telephone conversations since she exited the Democratic race in March, and now talk nearly weekly, according to people familiar with their discussions who spoke on condition of anonymity. The focus, according to one of the people, has been on public health and economic relief policy around a pandemic that has driven tens millions of Americans into unemployment.

“Like Senator Warren, Joe Biden has been a champion for working families over corporations his entire career,” Biden spokesman TJ Ducklo said, accusing Trump of pursuing policies favoring corporations and political allies over working Americans.

Ducklo added that Biden is working with Warren and “a number of experienced voices” to create plans to resolve the crisis and get help to Americans those who need it most.

Warren’s office declined to comment on her conversations with Biden.

Biden has consulted other former rivals for the Democratic nomination including Washington state Governor Jay Inslee, while his team also seeks the support of policy groups on the left.

During the Democratic race, Warren chided Biden for holding high-dollar fundraisers and not embracing sufficiently sweeping economic change. But people close to Biden said he and Warren are more aligned ideologically than their public differences might suggest, particularly in their belief that the U.S. middle class has been eviscerated - even before the pandemic.

‘I’M COUNTING ON HER’

Biden’s campaign on Sunday released a video showing him and Warren calling small-dollar donors together to thank them for their support. At one point, Biden joked that he never had as many contributors to thank until Warren’s endorsement, a reference to her grassroots fundraising prowess.

“I’m counting on her a great deal - not just for her endorsement but for her ideas and her leadership,” Biden said.

Biden already has begun embracing some Warren positions. In addition to the student-debt proposal, he joined Warren and Harris in their calls for federal health officials to release more data on racial disparities in the pandemic’s impact on the U.S. population.

Biden and Warren this month co-authored an opinion piece in McClatchy newspapers demanding more oversight over trillions of dollars in federal coronavirus relief aid that they said included “giveaways to the wealthy and big corporations.”

His rhetoric has shifted as well. Biden now talks about how the pandemic’s damage to the economy has created a “big” opportunity for “structural change,” echoing Warren’s campaign trail stump speech.

Last week, Biden said on his podcast that “we need some revolutionary institutional changes,” a shift in language from when he said after his victory in the pivotal Feb. 29 South Carolina primary contest: “Talk about revolution isn’t changing anyone’s life.”

But Biden remains opposed to some Warren priorities such as her proposed Medicare for All government-run healthcare system or a wealth tax on billionaires.

Former President Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president, last month praised Warren in the context of the pandemic, writing on Twitter that her proposals should serve as a model for policymakers. Biden and Obama speak regularly about his campaign.

“Joe Biden has more license now to go really big with bold systematic economic polices and not be accused of flip-flopping in any way, but instead be admired for meeting the moment,” said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a policy advocacy group that backed Warren during the primary campaign."

LONDON (Reuters) - Risk managers expect a prolonged global recession as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, a report by the World Economic Forum showed on Tuesday.

Two-thirds of the 347 respondents to the survey - carried out in response to the outbreak - put a lengthy contraction in the global economy top of their list of concerns for the next 18 months.

Half of risk managers expected bankruptcies and industry consolidation, the failure of industries to recover and high levels of unemployment, particularly among the young.

“The crisis has devastated lives and livelihoods. It has triggered an economic crisis with far-reaching implications and revealed the inadequacies of the past,” said Saadia Zahidi, managing director of the World Economic Forum.

Environmental goals risk being discarded as a result of the pandemic, the report said, but governments should try to carve out a “green recovery”.

“We now have a unique opportunity to use this crisis to do things differently and build back better economies that are more sustainable, resilient and inclusive,” Zahidi said.

The report was compiled by the World Economic Forum’s Global Risks Advisory Board together with Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc and Zurich Insurance Group.

Risk managers were surveyed between April 1 and 13."

The White House American Workforce Policy Advisory Board, which is co-chaired by White House adviser Ivanka Trump and U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, and includes Apple (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Tim Cook, Lockheed Martin (LMT.N) Chief Executive Marillyn Hewson and IBM (IBM.N) Executive Chairman Ginni Rometty, plans to call for “an unprecedented investment in digital infrastructure.”

The board’s efforts are aimed at helping connect displaced workers with pathways to upgrade their skills and learn new skills so they can move into “good jobs in rebounding fields as the health crisis abates and the economy begins to recover,” according to a White House official briefed on the plan.

“Our nation cannot achieve a satisfactory post-pandemic recovery unless the technological infrastructure is in place to connect and empower all Americans to participate in the workforce,” the official said in recapping the board’s message.

The board wants governments “to streamline occupational licensing, education requirements, reduce the cost of licensing, and increase reciprocity” and urges the federal government to “allow student financial aid for high-quality, short-term, market-aligned credential programs.”

Workforce issues have taken on new importance as the coronavirus pandemic has decimated the economy.

The United States lost 20.5 million jobs in April, the steepest plunge since the Great Depression. The unemployment rate surged to 14.7%, shattering the post-World War Two record of 10.8% touched in November 1982.

In a statement, Ross said the advisory board’s meeting comes at a “challenging” time, but expressed confidence the president’s policies will lead to a rapid rebound.

Ivanka Trump said in a separate statement the board will work to find “solutions to combat the job loss caused by this pandemic and help the unemployed get reconnected to the workforce.”

“By rallying around this call to action, leaders in business and government can help more people build skills that lead to good jobs, promote hiring that is based on skills not just degrees, and build a national skills infrastructure to connect workers with opportunities,” IBM’s Rometty said in a statement.

Four major companies — Walmart Inc (WMT.N), Salesforce (CRM.N), IBM Corp (IBM.N) and Workday Inc (WDAY.O) — are announcing Tuesday they are creating “Interoperable Learning Records” to help workers and employers match applicants with jobs, the official said."

With the coronavirus pandemic ravaging the global economy, the European Central Bank and the Bank of Japan have started paying banks to borrow from them, hoping they will keep the credit taps open for cash-strapped households and companies.

This subsidy is the newest twist in the topsy-turvy world of negative rates policy: rather than just punishing banks for sitting on their idle cash as they have been doing for years, central banks are now rewarding them for lending, or, in the ECB’s case, just for the mere fact of borrowing.

It also marks a shift that makes any further cut to the ECB’s and BOJ’s negative deposit rates – an increase in how much banks pay for parking their excess reserves – unlikely soon, even as money markets begin to price in chances that negative rates may soon make debuts in the United States and Britain.

Indeed, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda emphasized last week that he saw no need to deepen negative interest rates now.

“At this moment, we don’t think it’s necessary,” Kuroda said last week. “The most important thing now is to provide necessary financing to firms through the banking system, and to make financial markets stable,” he said in a seminar organized by the Financial Times.

AN EASING FOR BANKS

When the coronavirus pandemic hit the euro zone in March, the ECB was widely expected to cut its deposit rate again. But it refrained from doing so, instead offering banks loans at negative rates as long as they didn’t shrink their loan books.

The terms were later improved, with banks getting 0.50% for one year with no strings attached, or 1% if they don’t shrink their loan books.

The BOJ, which learned from the ECB in introducing negative rates in 2016, is now following suit in retreating from the policy.

Last month, it decided to pay 0.1% interest to financial institutions tapping its crisis-response lending program. That led to a surge in participating lenders.

It also was a departure from the BOJ’s long-held skepticism over rewarding banks for borrowing for fear of drawing criticism as unfairly subsidizing them.

“By offering a 0.1% interest, we’d like to incentivize (commercial banks) into helping us extend financial support to a wider range of firms,” Kuroda said last month.

Japanese bank lending rose steadily after Kuroda took the BOJ’s helm in 2013, including after the adoption of negative rates in 2016. But analysts attribute the increase more to rising loans for property investment.

While negative rates apply to only a small portion of banks’ reserves, they crushed already-narrowing profit margins at weaker regional banks. The BOJ warned in April that dwindling profits had driven banks into taking on more risk, enough to potentially destabilize Japan’s banking system.

NEGATIVE INTEREST? NOT INTERESTED

The questionable effect on lending has led many other central banks to look askance at negative rates, an issue raised again in the face of monumental job losses and activity declines resulting from efforts to stop the spread of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the novel coronavirus.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell spoke strongly against the idea in a webcast appearance last week, saying negative rates are “not something that we are looking at” even while the next steps to battle the coronavirus-related economic downturn are examined.

The U.S. central bank, in its own way, has similarly tried to pull banks into helping with the rescue. It has trimmed what it charges banks to borrow to just 0.25%, negligibly above what they can earn on their reserve deposits. The change in terms for the “discount window” came with encouragement that banks use it liberally and take advantage of some relaxed oversight.

But negative rates are a non-starter as a policy matter. Though investors have been betting recently the Fed will be forced down that road, Powell’s critical stance is echoed by other policymakers who feel the stress on banks and the U.S. dollar’s unique global role make negative rates policy unwise.

The Bank of England also appears hesitant, although it has been less full throated than the Fed in shooting the idea down. Governor Andrew Bailey said last week the BoE is not considering taking “the very big step” of pushing interest rates below zero, but that was undercut days later by the bank’s chief economist telling the Daily Telegraph the central bank was looking at the idea at the idea “with somewhat greater immediacy.”

Sayuri Shirai, a former Bank of Japan board member, says it has become a “near-consensus” among global central banks that negative rates have huge drawbacks and mixed positive results.

“It doesn’t make sense to deepen negative interest rates and hurt banks when you’re actually trying to encourage them to lend more,” she said. “It’s a tool that is very hard to use at a time like now.”

Help from the banking sector is particularly important in Japan and Europe, where banks are the primary credit source for many companies.

Both the ECB and the BOJ have eased collateral requirements for banks that tap their loan programs. After blind-siding banks with the 2016 move to negative rates, the BOJ now frequently seeks their views on what framework works best for them.

In its role as the euro zone’s bank supervisor, the ECB has also let banks eat into their capital and liquidity requirements to navigate the current crisis and invited them to keep provisions sufficiently low to avoid further economic damage.

For a watchdog set up to clean up the banking sector after the financial crisis more than a decade ago, it was a major change of tack.

“Unlike in the 2008 financial crisis, banks are not the source of the problem this time,” said Andrea Enria, the ECB’s chief supervisor. “But we need to ensure that they can be part of the solution."

India reported 4,970 new cases over the previous 24 hours, taking its total to 101,139. Deaths rose by 134 to 3,163.

India’s number of cases has easily outstripped that of China, where the virus emerged late last year and which has been one of Asia’s infection hot spots.

China has reported nearly 83,000 cases but has kept its daily rise in new infections to single digits for the past week.

In contrast, new cases in India have risen by an average of more than 4,000 a day over the past week, according to a Reuters tally based on official data, despite a severe weeks-long lockdown.

India officially extended the lockdown on Sunday to May 31, although several states indicated they would allow businesses to reopen.

Health experts and officials are worried about the strain the epidemic is placing on India’s over-stretched and under-funded hospital system.

Dhruva Chaudhry, president of the Indian Society of Critical Care Medicine, told Reuters last month that India probably had only about 100,000 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 40,000 ventilators.

Chaudhry warned there was not sufficient infrastructure or staff in the country of 1.35 billion people to handle a sharp spike in the number of critical patients.

While not every coronavirus patient needs an ICU bed, health experts worry about surging cases in India, particularly as many believe the official tally falls short of the reality.

India has not provided a detailed breakdown on the condition of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, although authorities have reported that about 37,000 people have recovered.

India’s death rate is less than that of some other big countries, at 3%, compared with about 6% for the United States, where some 89,000 people have died, and 14% for Britain."

Under the new rules, buses, taxis and three-wheelers will return to the streets but with restrictions. Buses will not carry more than 20 passengers, each of whom will be screened before boarding, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said.

“Corona will stay, and we will also survive,” Kejriwal said, outlining the new guidelines for the city of 20 million people that has one of highest numbers of coronavirus cases in the country.

However, a factory of the Chinese smartphone maker OPPO near Delhi suspended operations after six workers tested positive for the coronavirus.

The factory had received government permission to resume limited production as part of a gradual relaxation of the shutdown that began on March 25.

But when OPPO tested workers prior to the restart, six tested positive for COVID-19, said Deep Chandra, senior official at the Greater Noida Industrial Development Authority.

OPPO said in a statement that operations at the plant were suspended and it would only allow employees with negative test results to resume work.

Karnataka, home to technology hub Bengaluru, also lifted some restrictions on the movement of trains, taxis and buses within the state. Transportion from outside the state will remain suspended except for essential services.

Experts say that coronavirus cases will rise in coming weeks as India’s lockdown is eased, and authorities have repeatedly told companies resuming operations to ensure that social distancing and other measures are taken to prevent infections.

MIGRANT WORKERS

India has seen a rapid rise in coronavirus infections in recent days, with confirmed cases at around 96,000 and more than 3,000 deaths, according to federal data.

On Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government extended the nationwide lockdown to May 31, but relaxed rules in areas with lower numbers of cases and allowed state governments to issue their own guidelines on some matters.

With the restrictions eased, some traffic poured back onto the roads of the capital, and hairdressers, beauty parlours, stationary shops, and butchers were among the small businesses reopening elsewhere in the country.

But schools, malls and other public places will remain mostly closed, and large gatherings are still prohibited.

Compounding the challenges for the country, hundreds of millions of migrant workers have been stranded across India for weeks, unable to return home after authorities banned all transport services in late March.

After a series of road and rail accidents, where dozens of workers died, authorities are now increasing efforts to help them home.

Businesses from airlines to small stores are reeling from Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s nearly two-month lockdown of India’s 1.3 billion people aimed at limiting the spread of the new coronavirus. Many firms say they won’t survive unless they are bailed out immediately.

The government said on Sunday it would privatize state-run companies in non-strategic sectors and stop fresh insolvency cases for a year.

But apart from that its plans entail a mix of easy loan schemes, a bit more money for a rural job-guarantee program, and a slew of long-awaited policy reforms across sectors that will take effect over the medium-term.

Combined, this is not enough of a boost to prevent a likely 5% contraction in Asia’s third-largest economy in fiscal 2020/2021, Goldman Sachs said on Monday. It said it expected the economy to shrink an eye-watering 45% on an annualized basis in the quarter to the end of June.

Business leaders are unimpressed by the government’s response.

“We are creating all sorts of liquidity for supply, but what about the demand,” said Kiran Mazumdar Shaw, chairperson of Biocon Limited, one of the country’s top health firms.

“Demand is going to play a very big part in economic revival, and if we cannot kick-start demand I fear than we cannot have economic revival. I think we have lost a big opportunity,” she said.

A breakdown of the rescue plan shows that the actual spending of the government is only about a tenth of the $266 billion package, which Modi had hailed as 10% of India’s gross domestic product in line with the big stimulus plans announced by other major economies.

A large part of the rest of the package is actually loans provided by banks, many of them without collateral, leveraging $105 billion of liquidity provided by the central bank, government officials said.

“We would not qualify it as a stimulus package ... Only 1% of GDP is given to compensate for the income loss, which is not likely to be sufficient, “ said Sunil Tirumalai of brokerage Emkay Global.

One percent of GDP would amount to about $29 billion - and the government may well spend even less than that as it fears a sovereign rating downgrade.

GOVT ‘HAS LIMITED RESOURCES’

Two government officials said the government estimates total spending of $27 billion from the budget this year towards the rescue measures, which would prevent the fiscal deficit from widening more than 100 basis points beyond the target of 3.5% of GDP.

The finance ministry must also assess the scale of intervention required if the coronavirus pandemic drags on for longer than currently expected, officials said.

“We do not know how the situation would evolve or how long it will go on for. We need to prepare for that as well, as the government has limited resources and needs to spend wisely,” said one of the officials, who did not want to be named.

Distress is mounting across the economy. Emkay estimated the cost of the lockdown at around $170 billion overall.

Indian airlines are taking an average daily loss of $10 million-$12 million and will need extra funding of 325 billion-350 billion rupees ($4.3 billion-$4.6 billion) in the next two years, according to ratings agency ICRA, a unit of Moody’s.

Airlines have been cutting staff and wages to avoid defaulting on debts to their lessors or banks, even as their fixed costs such as servicing and parking fees keep mounting.

The government has also provided no support to the tourism industry, which is likely to see tens of thousands of job cuts and small firms going bankrupt, the Federation of Associations in Indian Tourism & Hospitality said.

And a fifth of the 70 million retail traders who form the bedrock of Modi’s political support may go under because they are unable to pay wages and rent.

With the lockdown now extended to the end of May, only one thing seems certain: The road back to economic health is going to be long and hard.

The 35-year-old was filmed arriving at the Turin club’s Continassa training ground in a black car and was due to undergo a medical before joining coach Maurizio Sarri and his team mates.

Ronaldo flew back to his native Madeira after Juventus beat Inter Milan 2-0 behind closed doors on March 8, their final game before Serie A was suspended because of the novel coronavirus outbreak.

He returned to Turin in a private jet earlier this month but then had to spend two weeks at home under Italy’s quarantine rules.

Serie A clubs returned to training on May 4 but are restricted to training in small groups and must respect social distancing guidelines.

The government is still deliberating on whether to allow Serie A to restart but said on Monday that it would not happen before at least June 14, one day after the league had hoped to begin.

The squad is still without forward Gonzalo Higuain who only returned to Italy from Argentina last Thursday and must spend another 10 days in quarantine."

There have been few winners in the March quarter, although companies are expected to fare better over the following three months, a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data on 2,087 companies found. Profit is expected to decline 27% in the quarter to the end of June.

The data showed that about 73% of Asian firms have reported their March quarter earnings so far.

“We are optimistic that China will lead the Asian region out of its depressed state. It will likely show a modest recovery in sales and profits in Q2, and a strong bounce ... from Q3 onwards,” Khiem Do, a fund manager at Baring Asset Management, said.

“The rest of the Asian region will follow suit, most probably from Q3 onwards.”

In the March quarter, oil companies cumulatively posted losses for the first time in at least a decade as oil prices slumped because cars remained parked and planes were grounded.

China’s top two oil companies, PetroChina (601857.SS) and Sinopec (600028.SS), posted record losses.

Airlines reported their biggest losses in at least 10 years, and profit at companies that depend on discretionary spending, such as automakers, slumped 94%. Companies that supply machinery reported an 83% fall in profit as factories were shut.

Among the outliers was Chinese tech giant Tencent (0700.HK) as people spent money on its games and social media sites.

“There are very early signs that the cuts in earnings forecasts have started to show signs of coming to some end,” Herald van der Linde, head of Asia equity strategy at HSBC, said.

Analysts, according to Refinitiv data, cut their profit forecast for the next 12 months by 2% in the past 30 days. In the 30 days before that, they lowered their estimate by 9% for the period.

Premier League players are allowed to return to training from Tuesday after clubs agreed to allow “small group” sessions, with a possible resumption of normal ‘contact’ training next week.

Deeney, 31, said last week he would not put his family at risk.

“We’re due back in this week. I’ve said I’m not going in,” he told a podcast with boxing promoter Eddie Hearn and former WBC cruiserweight champion Tony Bellew.

“My son is five months and he’s had breathing difficulties. I don’t want to come home to put him in more danger. You’ve got to drive in in your own kit, you can’t have showers, then you’ve got to drive back home in the same dirty kit you’ve got.”

Britain’s statistics office said this month that black men are 4.2 times more likely to die from COVID-19-related causes than white males.

About a third of Premier League players are from a Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) background.

“While we are getting tested and while we are going to be in a very safe environment, it only takes one person to get infected within the group. I don’t want to be bringing that home,” said Deeney.

“I can’t get a haircut until mid-July, but I can go and get in a box with 19 people and jump for a header. I don’t know how that works. No one could answer the questions, not because they didn’t want to, just because they don’t know the information.”

In separate statements, the clubs announced that the matches would take place at each of their stadiums and would raise money for boosting healthcare resources in Italy and Spain, but not in Germany.

“The net proceeds from all three games will be donated to medical facilities in Italy and Spain,” said Bayern’s statement.

“FC Bayern sees its contribution as a symbol of support for a united Europe, in which everyone takes responsibility for each other.”

Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge added: “Despite all the suffering and all the problems, we in Germany are perhaps fortunate that our healthcare system is proving resilient in this crisis.

“But we have also seen horrifying images from Italy and Spain, both countries among those hardest hit in Europe by the pandemic.”

Italy is the second-worst affected country in Europe behind Britain by the coronavirus, with a death toll of more than 32,000. Spain is the third-worst affected, with over 27,000 people dying from the virus.

Germany has fared comparatively well, registering 8,007 deaths despite having the highest population in Western Europe.

Last Saturday, the Bundesliga became the first major soccer league in Europe to resume action after the virus paralysed world sport in March.

Bayern will host Real at the Allianz Arena in Munich, Real will play against Inter at their Santiago Bernabeu stadium, while Inter would host Bayern at the San Siro.

The three clubs added that healthcare professionals who have fought against the pandemic would be invited to the matches, which will take place when it is safe for supporters to return to stadiums without risk of being infected by the virus."

FILE PHOTO: A vessel leaves the Orlan oil plattform at Sakhalin-1's off-shore rig at the Chaivo field, some 11 km (7 miles) off the east cost of Sakhalin island October 10, 2006. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin

Lockdowns to stop the spread of COVID-19, the flu-like infection caused by the virus, have snarled the supply of spare parts and have prevented maintenance workers from doing their job.

Regular repairs are needed to keep wells pumping, pipelines and refineries functioning and ships moving. Without maintenance, the risk of glitches or unplanned outages increases and delays risk driving up the cost of work later - partly because there will be a rush to do maintenance when lockdowns ease, and partly because plants have lost the optimal timing and weather for work during the northern hemisphere spring.

“When the virus and the quarantine measures have been eased and it is safe to get back to work, it doesn’t mean the same work can be done with the same intensity because the weather windows could be missed and that can push maintenance even to the next year,” said Matthew Fitzsimmons, Vice President of the Oilfield Service team at research firm Rystad.

In the meantime, companies which service the oil industry are being hit by the lack of work.

“A lot of service companies are not getting the revenues they had otherwise expected in 2020. That is going to have a huge impact on the health of the service industry,” said Fitzsimmons.

A MAJOR HEADACHE

Oil and gas companies involved in exploration and production spent an average of $80 billion a year on maintenance between 2015 and 2019, according to Rystad.

The industry typically takes advantage of periods of slow demand to do repair work but with oil prices nearly halved since the start of the year, this is no ordinary trough. Companies, many of them lumbered with high debts, are slashing all but the most essential work.

Some units were shut down for maintenance but the work never started according to Amanda Fairfax, downstream oil market analyst at Genscape, a firm that monitors refineries activities with cameras.

“They don’t want either to invest the capital expenditure into the maintenance project or they don’t want to have as many contract workers on sites as the additional influx of workforce might compromise people who have to remain at the refinery as essential personnel,” she said.

A large maintenance programme in Russia’s Far East Sakhalin-2 project faces delays as the firm could not get pre-ordered pieces of machinery, two sources told Reuters.

“There was a major headache with parts manufactured in China. After the coronavirus outbreak there, the supplier told us it couldn’t deliver our order. There are attempts to replace it, but the time has been lost,” an industry source told Reuters.

Sakhalin Energy told Reuters that the company operates according to a long-term maintenance plan, which is being constantly revised.

“All works will be carried out in accordance with up-to-date plans, safety instructions and quarantine measures required by the state authorities,” the company’s representative said in an email.

Its neighbour, Sakhalin-1 project, operated by ExxonMobil (XOM.N), also said earlier this month that it was adjusting the schedule and scope of work at the plant.

“To ensure the safety of our personnel ... we are focusing on those activities, which can be executed safely in the current COVID-19 situation and are essential for our continued economic and operational resilience,” ExxonMobil said.

Reuters has identified nearly a dozen companies whose maintenance and development plans have been affected by lockdowns.

THE ITALIAN CONNECTION

The lockdown in Italy, which has suffered one of the worst virus outbreaks globally, has reverberated across the energy sector because the country is a leading valve manufacturer.

An industry source in Milan told Reuters that until recently less than 10 percent of Italian producers remained active, struggling to supply even strategic valves to overseas clients.

Italy eased its coronavirus lockdown early in May, giving factories the green light to restart production lines.

One energy company in Nigeria said it was hoping to receive valves from its Italian supplier soon as they had been first in line when the shutdown began, the source said. But others are less optimistic.

A maintenance and development operation at an onshore field in Nigeria was delayed for months as the local oil firm could not receive equipment on time, a company source told Reuters.

Oil companies across Nigeria have also struggled to move workers to where they are needed due to lockdowns that vary by state, and regulations from the petroleum regulator limiting the number of workers at any oil site is also complicating operations. Rivers state, home to the oil hub of Port Harcourt, is under a lockdown so strict that the governor arrested 22 oil workers who landed there, despite federal government permits allowing them to travel.

The Rivers movement restrictions have also trapped pipes and other needed materials that are needed at oil fields outside the state, industry sources told Reuters.

NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India’s cricket board (BCCI) will wait for more clarity on international travel restrictions before making a call on the limited-overs tour of Sri Lanka in July, a top board official told Reuters.

Virat Kohli’s team are scheduled to play three one-dayers and the same number of Twenty20 Internationals in Sri Lanka but the series is under threat due to measures imposed to battle the COVID-19 pandemic.

“Nothing has been decided as yet, because we are not sure what would be the travel restrictions then,” BCCI treasurer Arun Singh Dhumal told Reuters by telephone.

“There is no clarity about it. So we’ll wait for that and accordingly take a call.”

India has extended a nationwide lockdown to May 31 while all commercial flights in and out of Sri Lanka remain suspended at least until the end of the month.

Bangladesh are being similarly cautious for their three-test series in Sri Lanka in July and August.

“We have to look at travelling restrictions in Bangladesh, and the quarantine protocols in both countries,” Bangladesh Cricket Board chief executive Nizamuddin Chowdhury told ESPNcricinfo.

“We have to be mindful of the players’ readiness ... we have to figure out other details about this tour.”

Sri Lanka have already had to postpone home series against England and South Africa because of the global health crisis."

Travelling has proven resilient after previous crises, which suggests that once a Covid-19 vaccine, treatment or other solution is found, antsy globetrotters will pack their Samsonites in nearly full force again. Notable changes are likely to be in health checks and corporate flyers.

The pandemic’s effects will undoubtedly linger. Count Warren Buffett, whose investment horizon is longer than most, among those worried that some changes to travel habits will endure. The billionaire’s Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate dumped its big stakes in four U.S. airlines amid the crisis.

There’s reason for concern. It took nearly two years for North American flight demand to return following the 9/11 attacks, according to Morgan Stanley research. Overnight stays abroad this year are expected to fall by 20% to 30% from 2019, according to the World Tourism Organization, which would amount to a loss of up to $450 billion in receipts. After the global financial crisis in 2009, the comparable decline was a mere 4%.

Travellers probably will stay closer to home at first. Domestic driving vacations, for example, make more sense in many places while flights are grounded, and national borders closed. Before bigger vacations get planned, popular destination spots will have to reopen. With most of Walt Disney’s theme parks and other major attractions unavailable, there’s less incentive to embark on a journey anytime soon. Eventually, though, airlines, hoteliers and online booking sites should be able to start luring confined consumers back with tantalising discounts.

Costs will ultimately be on the rise, however. Airlines can expect lasting changes to their expense structures. Just as a single bomb threat forced passengers to remove their shoes before boarding, the virus is likely to usher in a mask-wearing era. Temperature checks, deeper cleaning of planes and new boarding protocols all will be more time-consuming and chew up money. Many middle seats also will be empty for a while, as Southwest Airlines boss Gary Kelly noted for his $16 billion discount carrier, forcing further financial recalibration. Roughly 77% of seats need to be filled for airlines to break even on an operating basis, according to the International Air Transportation Association trade group.

Some destinations also may fare better than others. Countries with better-developed healthcare systems, such as Switzerland and New Zealand, will be more appealing, providing even greater incentive to channel government stimulus funds into improving them now. At least some tourists are already thinking about their next itinerary. Embattled cruise operator Carnival, for one, said nearly half its passengers had opted for future credit instead of refunds on cancelled trips. The company is planning to restart some voyages in August.

There is other mildly encouraging evidence for the industry even though Expedia and others have withdrawn financial forecasts and Delta Air Lines boss Ed Bastian expects a recovery to take two to three years. Domestic bookings for China’s largest online travel agency, Trip.com, are on a rapid rise. Travellers in their teens and twenties are powering the $15 billion company’s first stage of a rebound in May, signalling that less risk-averse generations will help lead a post-pandemic age of tourism. Certain carriers, such as Ireland’s Ryanair, with more flexible cost structures also may be better able to navigate the crisis. More consolidation could be necessary and allowed.

Mobility will be more difficult, however. Countries wary of future contagion may tighten their borders and widen the scope of what constitutes non-essential travel. Leisure trips are also apt to become onerous. Health immunisation documents could become as vital as passports. Global air traffic, meanwhile, is expected to slow to a compound annual growth rate of 4.6% through 2028, from an estimated 5.1% before the crisis, according to UBS.

Business travel looks especially vulnerable. Such spending had been projected to reach $1.7 trillion worldwide by 2022, according to industry estimates. Serious concerns are evidenced, however, by two investors recently backing out of a proposed deal to buy a stake in a corporate airfare and hotel booking enterprise half-owned by American Express at a $5 billion valuation.

By the time the pandemic blows over, companies also will be more accustomed to remote working, and happy to keep costs down by using videoconferencing to meet with clients over first-class tickets and conference boondoggles. Even a modest 5% long-term hit to this segment of the market would upend many business strategies. For the beaten-up travel complex, this area will leave the most lasting scars."

A squeeze of a lever, much like a cyclist operates a handbrake, opens a slot in the front of the mask so that food can pass through.

The process could get messy with ice cream or sauces, but more solid morsels can be gobbled up in a flash a la Pac-Man in the arcade game.

“The mask will be opened mechanically by hand remote or automatically when the fork is coming to the mask,” Asaf Gitelis, vice president of Avtipus Patents and Inventions, said on Monday as he demonstrated the device at its offices near Tel Aviv.

“Then you can eat, enjoy, drink and you take out the fork and it will be closed, and you’re protected against the virus and other people sitting with you.”

The company said it plans to start manufacturing the mask within months and had already submitted a patent. It said it would likely sell at a 3 to 10 shekel ($0.85 to $2.85) premium above the price of the simple pale blue medical masks many Israelis wear.

Outside a Juice Bar in Tel Aviv, Reuters showed customers a cellphone video of the mask in action. Opinion was divided.

“I think this mask, that enables me to eat while I’m still wearing it, is a must-have,” said Ofir Hameiri, a 32-year-old graduate student.

But eating an ice cream cone, Ron Silberstein, a 29-year-old musician, said: “I don’t think this mask could hold this kind of ice cream - it’s dripping all over. I wouldn’t want to wear it afterward.”

Israel has largely reopened its economy after a dramatic drop in cases of the novel coronavirus. Restaurants are open only for takeout for the time being.

“This year, and there is no way around it, we will witness a historic economic downturn,” DIHK President Eric Schweitzer said when presenting the association’s latest survey of industrial companies.

The DIHK’s expectation for an economic plunge in the double-digit percentage range compares with the government’s forecast for a record contraction of 6.3% in 2020.

“German businesses are facing their biggest challenge since the end of World War Two,” Schweitzer said, adding that many industrial companies were facing massive liquidity problems.

The DIHK survey, conducted among some 10,000 industrial companies between May 4-6, showed three-quarters reported declining demand and 80% expected a substantial drop in sales.

Nearly 50% of German industrial companies are putting investments on hold and are planning to cut their budgets because of the coronavirus pandemic, it said.

Due to the disruptions caused by the outbreak in many countries across the globe, almost a fifth of German industrial companies are currently reorganising their supply chains, the survey showed.

“World market shares are currently being redistributed,” Schweitzer said.

DIHK trade expert Volker Treier said he expected German exports to decline by 15% this year, due to weaker demand from major export markets such as the United States.

For 2021, DIHK is expecting the economy to grow by roughly 5%, Schweitzer said."

In its decision, which is binding, the court said the virus “apparently is not a pandemic in Pakistan” and questioned why fighting it was “swallowing so much money”.

The court ordered shopping malls to be reopened if health authorities do not object, and curbs to be lifted on businesses opening on the weekends.

The order was issued using the supreme court’s broad authority to issue rulings “suo motu” - on its own motion - without waiting for a particular case to come before it.

Pakistan has reported 42,125 COVID-19 cases and 903 deaths. While those totals are low so far compared to many Western countries, the numbers have risen sharply this month.

Authorities, including Prime Minister Imran Khan, have said the rise in cases has been lower than projected estimates. Faced with the prospect of the lockdown causing economic collapse, they allowed retail markets to reopen last week in a phased lifting of a countrywide lockdown.

Doctors have criticised the reopening, expressing concern that the virus could quickly spread and overwhelm the health system.

“It will definitely lead to an increase in the number of cases, the number of critical cases,” the secretary of Pakistan’s Young Doctors’ Association, Salman Kazmi, told Reuters this month. “We are concerned about pressure that will come on the hospitals.”

Re-opened markets were immediately packed with customers last week, with little sign of social distancing or face masks.

The court said that as long as markets were open, there was no justification to shut shopping malls. It found no “justifiable rational or reasonable” basis for businesses to be ordered to shut over the weekend.

“We find no reason why so much money is being spent on this Coronavirus (COVID-19), for that, Pakistan is not the country which is seriously affected by it,” the court order said.

The court order came as the country’s railway announced that it will resume limited train operations from May 20, and two of the four Pakistani provinces started opening public transport.

With the Muslim Eid al-Fitr holidays coming up on Sunday or Monday subject to sighting of moon, the transport and retail shopping are expected to draw massive crowds."

This is a different organization that does produce magnesium stereate ( here ). It is located 12 miles (20 km) from Servicios Ambientales Carriaga ( bit.ly/2zDjQwG ).

A plant in Madison, Illinois, that produces magnesium stearate was blown up – false

Some claims reference a recent fire affecting the Magnesium Elektron plant in Madison, Illinois, that happened on May 7, 2020 ( here , here ).

While the Magnesium Elektron plant does manufacture magnesium products, it does not produce magnesium stearate. According to the company, the main product of the Magnesium Elektron plant in Madison, Illinois is magnesium sheets, not magnesium stearate (see page 22 here ). A corporate video of the factory is visible here ).

“Magnesium Elektron North America (MENA) has three sites that also supply magnesium sheet and coil for commercial, aerospace and defense applications,” states the company in a corporate brochure (see page 13 bit.ly/2WEQ03L )

A company spokesperson confirmed to Reuters via email that the “the factory in Madison, IL does not produce Magnesium Stearate.”

Conclusion

The two fire incidents did happen a day apart, but the plants in these fires do not produce magnesium stearate for hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin.

The claim comes amidst the worldwide search for a COVID-19 treatment and vaccine. Demand for hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, surged after Trump touted it as a potential treatment for the novel coronavirus in early April. U.S. regulators have since authorized its emergency use for COVID-19 patients ( here ).

While the drug has not been proven effective against the disease ( here , here ), it is being widely studied in the U.S. and abroad as a potential COVID-19 treatment ( here ).

VERDICT

False. These two unrelated fires did not affect plants that produce magnesium stearate.

This claim is scientifically untrue.

Example of the claims can be seen here and here and here .

Most claims refer to a version of a now-deleted, widely shared YouTube video of Dr Andrew Kaufman, a “natural healing consultant” ( here ) in an interview with Spiro Skouras, an online-personality and “independent researcher” with a popular YouTube channel.

In the video, Kaufman talks about how a future COVID-19 vaccine would provide a vessel to “inject genes” into humans, first by a procedure known as “electroporation”, in which an electric current “create[s] little holes in our cells that allow the DNA to go into our own cells” and then through the insertion of “foreign proteins that supposedly generate immunity”. Kaufman concludes that the vaccine, like the results of biotechnology in agriculture, will make humans “genetically modified organisms”.

There are multiple claims in the nearly one hour-long video, which are beyond the scope of this fact check. However, the main claim in these posts on social media that a COVID-19 vaccine will genetically modify humans (described in the headline of the video and by Kaufman) is false. While most headlines don’t mention DNA-based vaccines, Dr Kaufman talks about them in the video.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a DNA vaccine “involves the direct introduction into appropriate tissues of a plasmid containing the DNA sequence encoding the antigen(s) against which an immune response is sought, and relies on the in situ production of the target antigen.” ( here )

This means that, in contrast to the more widespread “conventional” vaccines ( here ) which use a whole pathogen or fragment, a DNA vaccine involves the injection of a small part of the virus’s genetic code (DNA or RNA) to stimulate immune response in a patient without an infection ( here ).

This procedure does not create a genetically modified organism, which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) defines as “an organism in which one or more genes (called transgenes) have been introduced into its genetic material from another organism using recombinant DNA technology.” ( here )

Mark Lynas, a visiting fellow at Cornell University’s Alliance for Science group, debunked the idea that a DNA vaccine could genetically modify an organism. Lynas told Reuters that no vaccine can genetically modify human DNA.

“That’s just a myth, one often spread intentionally by anti-vaccination activists to deliberately generate confusion and mistrust,” he said. “Genetic modification would involve the deliberate insertion of foreign DNA into the nucleus of a human cell, and vaccines simply don’t do that. Vaccines work by training the immune system to recognize a pathogen when it attempts to infect the body - this is mostly done by the injection of viral antigens or weakened live viruses that stimulate an immune response through the production of antibodies.”

Lynas added: “The DNA [in DNA vaccines] does not integrate into the cell nucleus so this isn’t genetic modification - if the cells divide they will only include your natural DNA. But this approach is incredibly promising for COVID because it can be scaled up very quickly, and is very versatile - it is easy to synthetically produce DNA sequences that match the required bits of viral genetic code.”

There are many trials currently underway for a COVID-19 vaccine worldwide, with some exploring the possibility of a DNA vaccine, which may be where this false claim stems from ( here , here ).

While there are trials for a DNA vaccine for COVID-19 underway, the method does not involve changing people’s existing DNA. A future COVID-19 vaccine would not make humans “genetically modified organisms”, as the video claims.

VERDICT

False. A future COVID-19 vaccine will not genetically modify humans. DNA vaccines do not integrate the virus’ DNA into the cell nucleus of its recipient but instead inject part of the virus’ DNA/RNA into tissues to stimulate an immune response in the body.

Reuters Fact Check. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt

The video, uploaded to Facebook on May 10, shows an elderly woman lying on a grey plastic sheet. The person filming the video scans the woman’s body, before lifting her hand to show the camera (here) .

In the accompanying Facebook caption, the user says the woman’s relatives were told she had died from COVID-19, but “when they forced their way into the morgue she was still alive in the zipped up body bag still breathing”. The caption also implies this was taken in a British hospital by linking it to the UK’s National Health Service (NHS).

It continued: “NHS your gonna get whats coming to you imagine if it was not for my grandmother and many other nurses who came to this country to help build the nhs and this is how you treat our people in your care.”

But this was not filmed in the UK, nor does it show proof that a woman was found to be alive after being mistakenly assumed to have died from COVID-19.

The video can be traced back to Brazil, where it went viral last week with similar claims that the woman had been taken to the morgue when she was still alive (here, here, here).

Brazilian brand names on products seen at various points in the 46-second clip also give clues to the location, including the logo for Brazilian packaging company Descarbox, and a bottle of water emblazoned with the logo for Floratta, a company based in the northern state of Pará (www.descarbox.com.br/, here).

On May 6, the Department of Health in Pará released a statement saying the video showed a patient at the Abelardo Santos Hospital in Belém, a hospital currently focused on treating patients with COVID-19 (here).

It added that the patient, referred to as Mrs A. V. S, had since died, but was “never referred to the Abelardo Santos morgue while she was alive”.

A piece of paper tucked beneath the woman’s leg in the video shows the first part of her “nome” (Portuguese for “name”) is “Anito”. It isn’t possible to make out the characters in the rest of her name, but this matches up with the first initial provided by the Pará Department of Health.

Mrs A.V.S had travelled to the hospital’s emergency department on May 4 and was in a “serious condition,” the statement continued. The following day, she was sent to a critical care room after her condition worsened, where she later died.

The statement also said the grey plastic sheet that Facebook users had identified as a body bag was actually “apparatus used as a transfer support between stretchers; a common method in hospitals”.

According to the Pará Department of Health, an internal investigation has now been launched into how the video was leaked, and said it amounted to “an unethical, inhumane attitude liable to criminal punishment”.

VERDICT

False. The video does not show a woman being found alive in a body bag in the morgue after her family were told she had died from COVID-19.

Examples of the warning posts, shared tens of thousands of times on Facebook, can be found here , here , and here .

“Unfortunately, scam artists are using the coronavirus pandemic to try to steal Medicare numbers and other personal data,” a CMS representative told Reuters by email. “These schemes include fraudulent offers, usually in the form of unsolicited telemarketing calls, for free COVID-19 testing and protective equipment including respiratory masks, with no intent of delivery.”

As reported by the Washington Post, the new coronavirus has “spawned a swarm of scam robocalls seeking to prey on Americans’ fears,” with fraudsters placing an estimated 1 million calls a day about the coronavirus to Americans’ smartphones. According to the Post, such scams intend “to swindle and harm Americans at their most vulnerable — including the elderly, who might be most at risk of developing severe illness” ( here ).

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) offers advice for avoiding coronavirus scams, warning Americans to “be wary of ads for test kits” and “hang up on robocalls” ( here ). The U.S. Justice Department has also issued a fraud alert ( www.justice.gov/coronavirus ). Attorney General William Barr wrote in a message to U.S. attorneys: “The pandemic is dangerous enough without wrongdoers seeking to profit from public panic and this sort of conduct cannot be tolerated” ( here ). To report COVID-19 fraud, the Justice Department advises the public to call 866-720-5721 or visit its complaint form, Justice.gov/DisasterComplaintForm .

“If a beneficiary receives any unsolicited telemarketing calls, know that it is likely a scam to obtain a beneficiary’s personal information,” the CMS spokesperson told Reuters. The official directed beneficiaries not to provide their Medicare, Medicaid, or Social Security numbers, and to be cautious about any unsolicited requests for personal information. Beneficiaries who notice suspicious activity on his or her quarterly Medicare Summary Notice should call 1-800-MEDICARE to report it.

The official told Reuters that the CMS is working with the Department of Justice, the FTC and other federal and state law enforcement authorities to actively monitor the effects of potential scams associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.

New figures for England and Wales brought the death toll to at least 42,990, a Reuters tally showed, including earlier data from Scotland and Northern Ireland, as well recent hospital deaths in England.

Tuesday’s numbers from the Office for National Statistics painted a grim picture in care homes, more than a third of which have been stricken by the novel coronavirus.

Deaths in care homes across the United Kingdom topped 10,000 as of May 8, although the increase has slowed over the last couple of weeks.

Comparisons with other countries are tricky, but the data confirmed Britain was among those hit worst by the pandemic , which has killed more than 317,000 worldwide.

Such a high UK death toll increases the pressure on Johnson, who says the government is following scientific advice. Opposition parties say he was slow to introduce testing and provide protective equipment to health workers, and that his policy left care homes exposed.

In March, Britain’s chief scientific adviser said keeping deaths below 20,000 would be a “good outcome”. In April, Reuters reported the government’s worst-case scenario was 50,000 deaths.

Unlike the daily death toll announced by the government, Tuesday’s ONS figures include suspected deaths from COVID-19.

Ministers dislike international comparisons of the death toll because Britain’s performance reflects its fast reporting of COVID-19 deaths data.

They say excess mortality - deaths from all causes that exceed the seasonal average - is more meaningful because it is internationally comparable. But Britain is faring poorly on this measure, too.

Excess deaths across the UK are now close to 55,000, ONS statistician Nick Stripe told the BBC."

LONDON (Reuters) - There are tentative signs that children may not spread the novel coronavirus as much as adults, two top epidemiologists said on Tuesday, though they cautioned that the bad news was that human immunity may not last that long.

As Europe and the United States try to get back to work after the first deadly wave of the novel coronavirus outbreak, world leaders are trying to work out when it is safe for children and students can get back to their studies.

The signs are that children may not spread it as much as adults, Dr Rosalind Eggo, who is on committees that advise the British government on its infectious disease response, told members of parliament’s upper house.

“We think that children are less likely to get it so far but it is not certain, we are very certain that children are less likely to have severe outcomes and there are hints that children are less infectious but it is not certain,” said Eggo of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.

John Edmunds, a member of Britain’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), told the House of Lords’ science committee that it was striking how children did not seem to play much of a role in spreading the novel coronavirus.

“It is unusual that children don’t seem to play much of a role in transmission because for most respiratory viruses and bacteria they play a central role, but in this they don’t seem to,” said Edmunds, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.

“There is only one documented outbreak associated with a school - which is amazing,” Edmunds said.

But he added there was potentially bad news, though, that human immunity to the novel coronavirus may not last long."

Restructuring firm KPMG said on Tuesday it had been appointed administrator to the 106-year old brand, which operates 18 retail stores and one concession outlet.

It also sells via its own website, through Amazon and wholesales to several large retail chains across the United Kingdom. It also has third party licence deals in Australia and Asia.

KPMG has already made 164 of Antler’s 199 workforce redundant.

“Although the business was trading well prior to the virus outbreak, restrictions imposed at the start of the lockdown period prompted the closure of Antler’s retail and wholesale outlets, while the impact on international travel has also significantly affected sales,” said Will Wright, partner at KPMG and joint administrator.

“With uncertainty over the lifting of travel restrictions placing further financial strain on the business, the directors concluded that they had no option but to appoint administrators.”

KPMG will continue to trade the business via its online channels while it assesses options for the brand."

Data published on Tuesday showed the claimant count rose by 856,500 — the biggest ever month-on-month jump — to 2.1 million, a 69% increase from March.

It was the highest level since July 1996, when Britain’s economy was still recovering from a deep recession caused by its failed bid to stay in the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, which had pushed interest rates to 15% in 1992.

April’s surge would have been even sharper without an emergency government programme to pay 80% of the wages of 8 million employees — or about one in four workers — put on temporary leave, who are not counted as unemployed.

“I think we should be prepared for the unemployment rate to increase significantly,” Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Therese Coffey told BBC radio.

Recent changes to Britain’s welfare system mean the claimant count number includes more people than normal who are still in work but have suffered a big drop in earnings. But the surge in claims showed the scale of the hit to the labour market.

“While only covering the first weeks of restrictions, our figures show COVID-19 is having a major impact on the labour market,” Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician at the Office for National Statistics, said.

A Reuters poll of economists had produced a median forecast for a leap of 676,500 in the claimant count, with forecasts ranging widely from just over 56,000 to as high as 1.5 million.

Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said the government’s wage subsidy scheme was holding off some job losses for now but it was not clear how firms would react when they are required to help fund it from August.

“Many companies will still be in the middle of a cashflow crisis,” he said. “Government faces an onerous task in winding down the scheme without causing too much pain.”

VACANCIES PLUNGE, PAYROLL TOTAL FALLS

Vacancies fell by the most on record in the February-April period with hospitality job openings dropping the most.

Experimental data, based on tax figures, showed the number of people on companies’ payrolls fell by 1.6% in April from March, equivalent to the loss of nearly 450,000 jobs.

George Brown, an economist with Investec, said the claimant count and vacancies figures probably underestimated the scale of the hit to the jobs market because they reflected the picture at the start of April.

Other data served as a reminder of how strong Britain’s labour market was going into the COVID-19 crisis.

Britain’s unemployment rate fell to 3.9% in the January-March period, which covered only one week of the lockdown which began on March 23, from 4.0% in the three months to February.

Growth in pay slowed but employment expanded by a much stronger-than-expected 211,000.

But with much of the economy shut down by the government, Britain could be heading for its sharpest economic slump in more than 300 years, the Bank of England has warned.

The country’s budget forecasters say unemployment could hit 10% in the April-June period, even with millions of workers shielded by the government’s wage subsidy scheme."

Britain, the world’s largest offshore wind market accounting for around 40% of global capacity, plans to generate more than a third of its electricity from the technology by 2030 in a bid to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050.

Iberdrola’s East Anglia (EA) hub project comprises three projects off the east coast of England, capable of generating a total of 3.1 gigawatts of electricity, which would make it one of the largest offshore wind projects in the world.

Under Britain’s contract for difference (CfD) scheme, qualifying projects are guaranteed a minimum price at which they can sell electricity. Renewable power generators bid for CfD contracts at auction.

“The plan is to have all of the projects fully consented in Q1 (2021)… ready to bid into the auction later in the year as the combined hub,” Jonathan Cole, Managing Director, Iberdrola Renewables Offshore Wind said in an interview.

Cole added that the project could still go ahead, even if it is unsuccessful in the auction.

“We believe super-scale developments like EA Hub will be key to Europe’s decarbonisation plans, whether it sells power via government-backed contracts or private power sales arrangements. We are looking at all options.” he said.

Construction on the project could start in 2022 and will take around four years to complete.

Iberdrola is already developing the East Anglia One project in the same region and Cole said the last of the 102 turbines was installed last month.

The 714 megawatt project will be fully operational in the next few months, he said.

HANOI (Reuters) - A free trade agreement with the European Union set to soon be ratified by Vietnam should boost the Asian nation’s economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic, the World Bank said on Tuesday, while urging faster reforms.

Vietnam’s legislature is expected to give its final approval later this month for a deal that would see tariff reductions on 99% of goods traded with the bloc, its second-largest export market after the United States.

Its trade minister has said he expects the agreement to take effect in July.

Vietnam’s economy grew at its slowest pace in the first quarter of this year, 3.8%, as the coronavirus outbreak hit output. But with just 324 cases and no deaths, Vietnam is set to resume economic activity sooner than its regional peers.

The European Union-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement (EVFTA) could boost Vietnam’s GDP and exports by 2.4% and 12% respectively over the next decade and lift hundreds of thousands of people out of poverty, the World Bank said in a report.

“Such benefits are particularly urgent to lock in positive economic gains as the country responds to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the bank said.

It said now was the perfect time for Vietnam to initiate deeper reforms and fix legal gaps and implementation issues to reap the full benefits of the agreement."

Russia reported 9,263 new infections on Tuesday, pushing its nationwide total to 299,941, and 115 more deaths, taking the total death toll to 2,837. Only the United States has reported more coronavirus cases.

The new cases were for a fourth successive day below 10,000. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said on Monday Russia had halted the growth in infections and that there were other positive signs.

Mishustin, one of four government ministers to catch the coronavirus, has been discharged from a clinic and is now working normally, the Interfax news agency quoted his spokesman as saying on Tuesday.

The U.S. embassy in Moscow said Russian President Vladimir Putin had requested assistance from the United States and that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered to send 200 U.S.-made ventilators.

The presidents spoke by telephone on May 7.

A first batch of 50 ventilators should be ready for shipment on Wednesday, while the remaining 150 will be ready shortly after, the embassy said in a statement.

Russia sent a batch of its own ventilators to the United States in early April, but U.S. officials say they were not needed in the end.

The Russian ventilator in question, the Aventa-M, came into the spotlight last week after it was reported to have caused fires in hospital in Moscow and St Petersburg.

That prompted Russia to suspend the use of Aventa-M ventilators produced after April 1."

Boeing has appointed former engineering and development chief Mike Delaney to head wider efforts to build confidence, and Airbus leaders say the industry is moving from an initial crisis phase to securing public trust.

That has triggered, among other things, a concerted effort to explain how cabin air filtration works in a bid to scotch the myth that the pressurised fuselage contains only static or recycled air.

Health officials are still quantifying various sources of transmission for COVID-19 disease caused by the virus, but attention focuses on the risk of catching it from airborne droplets from coughing or sneezing passengers as well as from touching infected surfaces.

The air-travel industry historically talks more about seat pitch than air quality. That’s had to change as a result of the pandemic.

“It’s about explaining what we do for the safety of passengers in the large sense: aircraft safety but also sanitary safety,” Airbus engineering head Jean-Brice Dumont said.

In an office building, air is exchanged about four times every hour. On a modern jet aircraft, that rises to 20 to 30 times.

“The air system on an airplane is as good as anything you will be exposed to,” Delaney said. Air circulation is only one of several techniques for reducing potential for the virus to spread on board including rigorous cleaning of the plane and screening passengers for signs of illness, he added.

In most cases compressed air is fed from the clean part of an engine - untainted by fuel which is added later - to air conditioning packs and from there to fans in the cabin ceiling.

Both planemakers say cabin air pours downwards not lengthways through the fuselage, reducing risks of infection.

Half that air is then recycled through hospital-grade HEPA filters designed to remove some 99.97% of contaminants including viruses. The other half is flushed outside through valves.

Planemakers say cabin air is renewed every two to three minutes, though scientists caution that in reality, air is always a blend. But the quicker the rate, the faster old air is diluted.

“The air turns over very, very quickly in the aircraft in terms of air-exchange rate. From that point of view the aircraft systems are very good,” said Professor Byron Jones of Kansas State University, who has helped recommend air standards.

HIGH OCCUPANCY

But air flow isn’t the only part of a complex equation.

“The biggest challenge you have on an aircraft is the extremely high occupant density. You have got a lot of people crammed into a small space, and you have to get a lot of air in there to ventilate that space to maintain the air quality,” Jones said.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say the virus is thought to spread between people in close contact or less than 6 feet apart, around half the width of many cabins.

Air currents over such short distances are said to be hardest to predict. Passengers have some control through the individual air outlets nicknamed “gaspers” above each seat.

On average, twisting them on makes things “a little bit better, but there is no guarantee,” Jones said.

Although filtered, the pinpoint blasts of air could in a worst case push nearby virus particles across a passenger’s face. On the other hand, the air shower could have the positive effect of limiting sideways movements of air.

Faced with such questions, Boeing and Airbus have deployed engineers to examine seat-to-seat air flows - using the same advanced physics at play in wind-tunnel testing of a wing.

“We are actively running simulations to see whether we could recommend something for the individual air jets, “ Dumont said.

The spectre of in-flight contamination dates back at least to the SARS epidemic in 2003, though no link has been proved.

In March that year, a 72-year-old man infected with SARS, which is also a coronavirus, took a flight from Hong Kong to Beijing. At least 22 of the 119 passengers and two crew later developed the illness.

It was the only significant case of in-flight transmission but prompted measures to prevent ill passengers boarding planes.

Such “kerb-to-kerb” measures must again be part of the strategy to keep the new virus off planes, Delaney said. Research on technology like ultraviolet-cleaning systems and anti-microbial materials may join the fight in the future."

MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Manchester United have urged fans to stay away from their Old Trafford stadium should the venue be used for behind closed doors games during the Premier League’s resumption of play.

The league remains in talks with the government about whether matches in closed stadiums will be held at neutral venues or, as many clubs prefer, on the usual home and away basis.

In an email to supporters, United confirmed they will refund season ticket and ticket holders for games held behind closed doors and made a plea for supporters to stay away from matches.

“We share your disappointment that you will not be able to watch United in person from within the stadium, but we would encourage you to give your continued loyal support from the comfort and safety of your home. To help with that, the Premier League and their media partners will work to deliver the very best broadcast coverage of our games,” the club said.

“We also ask for your co-operation not to travel to any stadiums at which we are playing on matchdays. By supporting from home and following government guidance, you will be playing your part to keep your friends, your family and all United fans safe.”

The Premier League is exploring a number of options for broadcasting of behind closed doors games including use of audio effects and computer generated “fans”."

BEIJING (Reuters) - China said the United States was trying to shift the blame for Washington’s own mishandling of the COVID-19 crisis, responding to President Donald Trump’s letter threatening to halt funding to the World Health Organization.

Trump threatened on Monday to reconsider the United States’ membership of the World Health Organization (WHO) if the organisation did not commit to improvements within 30 days, and said the body had shown an “alarming lack of independence” from China.

Chinese Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters on Tuesday that the United States was trying to smear China and had miscalculated by trying to use China to avoid its own responsibility."

Lines like this are common in the coronavirus era. Consumers across the world have had to wait to enter stores and limit purchases of staples like toilet paper or pasta. Saturday’s human traffic jam in downtown Zurich was different.

A flag flutters on the Swiss Parliament Building (Bundeshaus), after the weekly governmental meeting in Bern, Switzerland, November 27, 2019.

The horde on the pavement, none in face masks, was clamouring to get inside Gucci’s boutique. There’s nothing essential about a $870 pair of Screener GG Mignon trainers. Nor was this the only throng: the sidewalks were also packed in front of Louis Vuitton, Tiffany’s and other high-end shops. It was as if the Great Lockdown had come, and simply vanished.

Hard to say whether Switzerland’s experience, or that of neighbouring Germany and Austria, is a harbinger of what to expect from reopening countries like Italy, France, Great Britain and the United States. It will be a few weeks before data is available to determine whether a swift return to something approaching normality results in a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.

“Right now, it’s like we are in that moment after you have taken an exam and you are just waiting to see the results,” says Sergio Ermotti, the chief executive of UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank.

But there will be lessons to glean from Switzerland’s handling of the virus and subsequent quarantine, which has been surprisingly luxurious compared to the experiences of many other developed nations. The takeaway may be as simple as this: societies that prize self-responsibility, respect for rules and institutions – and plan for rainy days – are better places to shelter from the storm.

“One of the most underestimated factors is to what extent people have faith in their governments, and do they listen to them,” says James Breiding, author of “Swiss Made: The Untold Story Behind Switzerland’s Success”. Lack of trust has impeded efforts by the United Kingdom and United States to deal with Covid-19. In Switzerland, “the ballast is informed and engaged citizens who argue to the point of anarchy; and expect representatives to work for them with veto right if they screw up, (through) referendum.”

Switzerland, where direct democracy is practiced and cantons have wide-ranging powers, has been far from perfect in dealing with the pandemic. As the virus spread across the Italian border in late February, federal officials in Bern was slow to respond. There have been over 1,880 deaths from Covid-19, a rate of 218 per million population. That ranks it about the tenth worst among major nations. Yet it’s half the rate of France and Italy, across whose frontiers many healthcare workers cross to staff Swiss hospitals.

Once the seven-member Federal Council, presided by Simonetta Sommaruga, gave the order in mid-March to stay home, the strengths of the Swiss system became apparent. Non-essential shops were closed. Pasta and toilet paper shelves were briefly empty in some busier supermarkets but there was none of the panic buying seen in America and Britain. That’s partly thanks to the National Economic Supply Act, designed to guarantee a supply for up to six months of essential goods like sugar, cereals and medicines, and services in times of serious shortages.

If an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, then Switzerland may be the country version of the Boy Scouts. That’s evident in the private sector, too, notes Ermotti. Some 70% of UBS clients who took advantage of a 40 billion Swiss franc pool of government-backed loans had no previous credit line or debt. Moreover, only 40% of firms participating in the programme have drawn down their credit lines. “It really confirmed the resilience of small and medium enterprises going into the crisis,” Ermotti says.

Equally impressive was compliance with orders from federal and cantonal authorities, including bans on gatherings of more than five people at a time. “There is a social contract here and a lot of self-responsibility,” Tyler Brûlé, who chose Zurich as the Swiss headquarters of the global Monocle media and advertising business he founded in 2007, said in the Exchange podcast last week. “Social capital is very high here, it’s their way or the highway.”

Indeed, Switzerland’s lockdown severity was relatively consistent. According to the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker’s stringency index, Switzerland on March 17 rose to 79.49 out of 100, and didn’t deviate until April 27 when it relaxed some restrictions. By contrast, the United Kingdom lurched from 24 to 84 and now hovers around 70. Switzerland’s current 63 reading is below that of the United States, Italy and Denmark.

This partly validates the cliché of the prying Swiss neighbour. Before moving to Zurich in late January, multiple people who had lived in the country counselled me not to mix recycling with rubbish and warned that toilets cannot be flushed at certain hours of the day. During peak lockdown, Reuters reported on a surge in noise complaints and private detective inquiries, including on neighbours talking too loudly on late-night conference calls or holding large playdates.

This is a culture that conditions the Swiss to be on their best behaviour in ways that might feel constraining across the border in Italy. But it also means that government can play a less obvious role in enforcing orders. Though the police have broken up some anti-lockdown protests in Zurich, Bern and other cities, they’re not visibly monitoring social distancing.

Citizens appear to take responsibility for following guidelines, as community mobility reports compiled by Google suggest. During the week of May 7, visits to retail and recreation facilities in Zurich were down 54% from the baseline. By comparison, in my native Fairfield County, in Connecticut, the comparative decline was 34%. Where Zurichers excelled was in their visits to parks, up 90% from the baseline. That compared with 68% back home. This is perhaps unsurprising in a country where only around a fifth of adults are obese, compared with 36% of Americans. An ounce of prevention indeed."

UPBEAT. Who says the pandemic is all bad news? Three months after unveiling a restructuring plan, new Julius Baer boss Philipp Rickenbacher is already ahead of his 2022 targets for returns and costs. In a trading update for the year to the end of April, the Swiss wealth manager said adjusted pre-tax profit was 35 basis points of assets under management, sharply up from 22 basis points in 2019 and above a mid-term target of up to 28 basis points. Costs meanwhile shrunk to 64% of revenue, beating a cost-to-income goal of below 67%.

Frantic trading amid global markets gyrations has boosted transaction fees, compensating for cratering interest rates and higher credit loss provisions. But Julius Baer’s improved profitability is also a measure of compressed expenditures: Lockdowns prevented private bankers from criss-crossing the world to visit wealthy clients. That’s a lot less money spent on first-class tickets and Michelin star dinners. As the emergency eases, expensive habits might re-emerge. (By Lisa Jucca)

HOME INVASION. It was a rough quarter for Chinese search engine operator Baidu, whose advertising revenue slumped by nearly a fifth from a year earlier, to $2 billion. Investments in artificial intelligence got a Covid-19 lift, however. DuerOS, the company’s answer to Amazon’s smart-speaker assistant Alexa, received 6.5 billion voice queries in March alone, as trapped users asked for the latest pandemic update or ordered food.

The $37 billion company doesn’t break out financial figures for its nascent smart-devices business, but they’re probably small. Baidu shipped 17 million AI-powered speakers last year, less than half Amazon’s volume, according to research outfit Canalys. Boss Robin Li envisions generating revenue from subscriptions, advertising and e-commerce down the road. Additional benefits may include locking in users to other apps and services. For now, Baidu will have to see if customers heading out more often will keep making themselves at home with DuerOs. (By Robyn Mak)

DYING EMBERS. Tobacco company Imperial Brands on Tuesday said it will cut its dividend by one-third as it struggles to contain a 13.5 billion pound adjusted net debt pile. The move should save the company about 650 million pounds. But with EBITDA expected to be around 4.1 billion pounds this year, using Refinitiv estimates, net debt of 3.3 times EBITDA is still way off its target of 2.5 by the end of 2022.

As well as further tarnishing Imperial’s “dividend stock” moniker, the cut points to more fundamental threats. The company last year dropped its dividend growth target, focusing instead on investing in the business. Imperial on Tuesday admitted that it has cut investments into its vaping product after poor returns last year. Net revenue fell 43% to 83 million pounds in that division. One of tobacco’s key survival strategies is going up in smoke. (By Dasha Afanasieva)"

- Travel companies soar

- Oil market hopes

TRAVEL BUGS. Americans are ready to hit the road. That at least is the message from the stock market on Monday. Shares in car-rental firm Avis Budget zoomed ahead more than 20%. Hertz Global, which on Monday also removed boss Kathryn Marinello from the driver’s seat, was up almost as much.

United Airlines and Spirit Airlines soared highest in their industry, with Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines following with 13%, and American Airlines and JetBlue Airways in single digits.

Hotel chains rose, too, though slightly less. InterContinental Hotels was up by 9% and Hyatt Hotels by 13%. Perhaps shareholders expect vacationers to stay with family – or sleep in rental cars. But they certainly are seeking fresh air. Shares in casinos like Las Vegas Sands were up just 4% or so – a sign Americans don’t want to swap lockdowns at home for vacations inside.

TIME-TRAVELING OIL. Four weeks is a long time in the market for black gold. On Monday the price for West Texas Intermediate futures were changing hands for almost $32 a barrel for the forward-month contract, which expires on Tuesday. That’s despite the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission warning last week that prices could still go negative, just as they did for the previous forward-month contract in mid-April.

Oil watchers were hopeful about global supply cuts kicking in, Reuters reported Monday, though U.S. fields are causing the biggest problems. And yet, there’s a bright side: The number of U.S. rigs in operation plunged to 339, 190 fewer than at the start of the year, according to Evercore ISI.

With some large American cities slowly opening, and industrial giants like Ford Motor firing up plants, demand hopes are revving up too. These could still be dashed. But with oil prices now at levels not seen since early March, traders are starting to look like they’re throwing caution to the wind. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)

CHECKERED FLAGS IN VACCINE RACE. Moderna’s vaccine for Covid-19 hasn’t even completed one lap, but Wall Street assumes it’s heading for victory. The U.S. biotech company said on Monday that interim results from an early trial were promising. That tacked nearly $7 billion onto its now-$31 billion market capitalization. With late-stage clinical trials scheduled to begin in July, there could be a vaccine by fall.

Or that’s the theory. Moderna said the initial eight patients tested produced the same or greater concentrations of antibodies that can neutralize the virus as “generally seen” in recovered patients. But it’s unclear if antibodies are key to eliminating the virus. Some recovered people have very low levels. Moreover, even though the trial was small, several volunteers had severe temporary adverse effects. It’s far too early to assume this will pass the finish line, much less take the prize.

EASY TARGETS. UK grocer executives and their investors could be victims of their own success. That’s if the UK government introduces a windfall tax to raise much needed cash from businesses which have thrived during the coronavirus lockdown. Punters are keen. A recent YouGov survey found that 53% of people would support a so-called “excess profit tax.”

Hitting the grocers could be harder than it sounds. True, both Tesco and J Sainsbury enjoyed record sales in March, as customers rushed to stock up on loo roll and pasta. But Tesco boss Dave Lewis recently warned the group will take a hit of up to 925 million pounds from virus-related costs, like hiring 45,000 extra staff. The government may struggle to tax online giant Amazon.com, which books most of its UK revenue through a Luxembourg subsidiary. Still, retailers would only have themselves to blame. Ocado recently paid CEO Tim Steiner a 59 million-pound pay packet for 2019. Tesco churned out a 635 million-pound dividend in April, despite benefitting from state support on property taxes. Such largesse will make it difficult to plead poverty. (By Aimee Donnellan)

M&A MATTERS. JPMorgan’s dealmakers have some tips for chief executives contemplating a merger or acquisition. Having crunched the numbers on mega-deals struck during the last crisis, the bankers’ first lesson is that CEOs should take the initiative. Over three-quarters of the deals reviewed began with a buyer’s approach. Second, pay up: the median U.S. control premium during 2008 and 2009 was around 36%, compared with 27% from 2000 to 2019.

That’s because equity markets plummeted, meaning CEOs could offer more relative to prevailing share prices. Still, it confounds the logic for corona-crisis dealmaking today. The S&P 500 is down just 11% this year, compared with a much steeper fall in 2008, meaning CEOs have little room to sweeten control premiums. Meanwhile, the earnings they’re buying are just as uncertain, given the chance of a second virus wave. Little wonder M&A has shrivelled. (By Liam Proud)

EMIRHAD? Dubai-based airline Emirates is making drastic turns to weather the coronavirus storm, cutting 30,000 jobs, or a third of its workforce, according to Bloomberg. It’s also accelerating the retirement of its 100-plus A380 superjumbos. If that doesn’t restore stability, Emirates could try a more radical manoeuvre – a merger with local rival Etihad.

There are plenty of impediments, not least tensions between their respective homes, flashy Dubai and staid but uber-wealthy Abu Dhabi. That probably rules out the most obvious cost-saving – squashing their two hubs, now 60 kilometres (40 miles) apart, into one. But Abu Dhabi already bailed out Dubai in the financial crisis, and it needs to do something with Etihad, which made a $1.3 billion operating loss in 2018. Copying International Consolidated Airlines’ holding-company structure for British Airways and Spain’s Iberia might spare national blushes and reap some of the benefits of flying in formation.

RECKLESS DRIVING. Tianqi Lithium, a producer of the key ingredient for electric-vehicle batteries, is in talks with lenders to restructure its debt. Prices for the white metal have collapsed on the back of rapid expansion of mines. China’s easing of subsidies for battery-powered vehicles meant demand was already moderating, and the coronavirus promises to delay any recovery.

That’s left the Shenzhen-listed company in a rut. Its market value is now less than the $4.1 billion it paid for a minority stake in Chilean miner SQM in 2018. Total debt will remain at nearly 9 times EBITDA over the next 12 months, Moody’s wrote in April. Selling equity and strategic assets will help, but a reset of loans is a tacit admission that any proceeds will be underwhelming in a buyer’s market. (By Sharon Lam)"

LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Few things would please the world’s big automakers more than customers quickly returning to dealers’ lots to buy new cars once pandemic-induced lockdowns are lifted. What would top that is if many were to drive away in the battery-powered cars manufacturers have devoted hundreds of billions of dollars to develop. It may take state aid to tip the balance in electric vehicles’ favour.

Automakers’ outlook is brutal. Assuming factories reopen in full in the second half of 2020, global vehicle production would still decline by 21% from last year, IHS Markit predicts, the worst contraction since the financial crisis. Reflecting such pain, the Refinitiv Global Automobiles & Auto Parts index has fallen by nearly one quarter.

Still, the importance of Ford Motor and General Motors in the United States, Germany’s Daimler and Volkswagen and China’s Dongfeng Motor to their respective country’s economy should put automakers at the centre of any post-virus stimulus plans. And the International Monetary Fund has called for governments to pursue a green economic recovery.

These environmental and economic issues converge around electric vehicles, which by rights should become more appealing to drivers now. Air pollution, after all, might worsen the disease, adding to the concerns about climate change that first fuelled their adoption. Shares in Elon Musk’s Tesla, which accounted for around a fifth of global electric vehicle sales last year, have nearly doubled in 2020, signalling that carmakers should flog more than the roughly 2% of total auto sales the segment accounted for in 2019.

But battery-powered cars are in general more expensive, even though the affordability gap to vehicles running on fossil fuel has halved over the past five years. Jefferies analysts reckon the recent oil-price crash has widened gas guzzlers’ advantage to some $8,000 over the average ownership period. That’s a big hurdle when joblessness has skyrocketed.

Governments can help by, say, rehashing for electric vehicles the popular cash-for-clunkers programmes rolled out after 2009 in the United States, United Kingdom and Germany. Tripling the number of electric cars sold last year to 6.5 million with a $6,500 subsidy per vehicle, roughly the upper limit of what Germany currently offers, according to Deutsche Bank, would cost some $42 billion, or less than 1% of the combined 2019 GDP of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.

Pricey, yes, but hardly prohibitive. Faced with widespread economic devastation, states can afford to accelerate towards a lower-carbon future."

(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) has given out more than $30 billion in loans to over 250,000 businesses as part of the United States’ coronavirus aid program for small businesses, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a memo on Tuesday.

JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank, approved more than $45 billion in new credit for its clients impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in March and April, Dimon said in a memo to stakeholders.

Dimon said the size of the average loan under the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was $122,000 and half of the loans went to companies with fewer than five employees.

The U.S. Justice Department has sent grand jury subpoenas to big banks seeking records as part of a broader investigation into potential abuse of a $660 billion emergency loan program to help small businesses hurt by the novel coronavirus, two people with knowledge of the matter told here Reuters.

Dimon, who has been CEO of JPMorgan for over a decade, also said the bank’s strategy for returning more employees to work on-site hinges on using the latest data and information and prioritizes the health and safety of its employees.

The hundreds of inmates of La Esperanza prison in central Honduras must leave its small courtyard and file back to their cramped cells.

Throughout the night, packed into a room with 130 other men, Estrada hears his neighbors' muffled whimpering as rats scuttle by.

""That is when the hell really begins,"" said the powerfully built and bearded 25-year-old, glancing a final time at the armed guards perched on the rooftop, silhouetted against the dimming sky.

""The best way to get out unscathed, is to keep your head down,"" said Estrada, quiet and composed.

Behind the bars, the ultimate law is that which reigns in Central America, a mantra sprayed onto walls in gang-controlled neighborhoods: ver, oír, y callar. See, hear, and shut up.

Estrada is serving his fourth year of a six-year sentence for marijuana possession in La Esperanza, a low-security prison tucked into the pine and oak-lined mountains of central Honduras. Its name, in Spanish, means hope.

The roots of the problems at La Esperanza plague prisons throughout Latin America, said director Jose López Cerrato: harsh sentences for small crimes, lack of proper police investigation, and many detainees held without charge, often for years.

A whiteboard at the entrance keeps a daily tally. The top line never changes: ""Prison Capacity: 70 inmates."" But the rows below of the actual number of prisoners tick up and down. Today's count: 454.

Gerson Ramos, 24, waits for prison guards to fill out some paperwork before being released.

But as the coronavirus took hold in Honduras, authorities banned visits. And with prohibitively expensive rates for calls from the prison's three working phones, inmates are now all but cut off from the outside world.

The only reprieve is visiting days, when children, grandparents and wives breathe life into the courtyard, taking over the kitchen, playing ball, and praying with the inmates at religious services.

""Taking away visits is the worst thing that can happen. It's what they need most because, more than anything, it gives them hope,"" says Jacinto Hernández, La Esperanza's psychologist. ""I fear it could turn violent as the virus spreads and anxieties increase. Aggressions already run high; they barely have room to breathe.""

In addition to the health risks posed by overcrowding, staff worry about the pandemic's mental toll.

An inmate, who said he was having respiratory issues, is checked by medical practitioner Blenda Paredes inside the prison.

So far, the country's 29 prisons have largely been spared, but should the virus spread inside the crumbling system, the results could be devastating. Honduras' prisons, designed for just over 10,000 inmates, are home to nearly 22,000, according to recent counts.

Honduras has had over 2,000 reported coronavirus cases and 120 deaths, although most public health experts say those numbers are a likely underestimate.

Hernández estimates about one fifth of the male population already leaves with post-traumatic stress disorder they did not have when they arrived.

Water is only available a couple of times a week and, with just one shared bathroom, men bathe in the courtyard with cold water from buckets used to wash the clothes they drape overhead. Respiratory illness are common, the product of sleeping on the ground exposed to the cold mountain air.

Built in 1937, La Esperanza's imposing colonial-style blue and yellow structure sits across from the town's main square, where young lovers steal furtive kisses on park benches.

Inmates line up with buckets as they wait to collect water for bathing and washing clothes from a large concrete storage container in the prison courtyard.

Before the coronavirus, family visitors would sell goods the men had made - hammocks, fishing nets, toy cars - to raise money for soap, coffee and cigarettes. They brought empanadas, fried chicken, and tamales as a relief from the meager prison diet staples of rice and beans.

Most days the men make crafts, lift makeshift weights, or play cards to keep them occupied.

""It's complicated to breathe, but summer is true hell and you can feel everyone's bodies,"" said Erlin Mendez, 27, who shares his 38-inch wide space with another inmate, who he says is in for murder after an alcohol-fueled machete fight.

Intibucá, where La Esperanza Prison is located, is one of Honduras' poorest areas. Illiteracy is high; alcoholism pervasive. The most common crimes are domestic violence, drug possession and homicide.

Each of the windowless rooms is a dark labyrinth of improvised wood-and-plywood beds, with limbs protruding at every turn.

Inmates lucky enough to have beds, and especially beds with curtains, would rent them out to prisoners with female visitors. ""These visits definitely keep tensions lower,"" said Israel Miranda, 36.

Catalino Rodriguez, 50, and Santos Primitivo, 23, lie in their sleeping quarters inside an over-crowded cell that they share with several other inmates.

Story

Another part of the prison holds female inmates.

Under a rusty tin roof in an attached building, the women are sectioned off behind a chain link fence. ""It's like being in a really depressing zoo,"" said Elian Martinez, a 39-year-old mother of three who says she was wrongfully accused of fraud.

The one cell for six women has four beds and space for three people to stand. They get three hours of sunlight a week at an adjacent guard tower.

In the men's section, 132 men sleep in a room with fewer than 50 beds. Newer inmates sleep wherever they can find a patch, often sharing the floor with cockroaches and rats. The wait for a bed is around three years.

""You never get used to it, just resigned,"" Estrada said. ""Each day you wake up at 5 AM, wait in line for water and food, survive, and it means one day fewer, one day closer to family."""

Even in Italy, where extended family relations run deep, Marzio Toniolo's tale of a coronavirus lockdown is unusual - four generations cooped up in one house.

They range in age from his three-year-old daughter Bianca to her great-grandfather Gino, 87. The experience tested bonds of love under the stress of cohabitation, and he believes they have passed the test.

The Toniolo family make a toast, clinking their glasses at home after cooking homemade ravioli. Toniolo, a 35-year-old elementary school teacher, his wife Chiara, 32, and their daughter, were staying in his grandparents' house in San Fiorano, a small town in northern Italy. They had moved from Milan, found jobs in local schools, and were waiting for their house in the town to be ready for moving in. Toniolo's father, Massimo, 62, was visiting from Sardinia.

A group of young people hang out listening to dance music on a boombox, by a train track. On Feb. 21, San Fiorano became part of the ""red zone"", a cluster of towns sealed off in what turned out to be a futile attempt to contain the virus.

Marzio takes a selfie as his daughter Bianca holds his face while they play “mother and baby” on a rainy day at home. ""The worst moment was when the first person in San Fiorano died. I know the son. I was already under a lot of stress,"" Toniolo said. ""That night, I almost had a panic attack and took a tranquiliser for the first time in years.""

On the fourteenth day of quarantine, Marzio’s grandmother Ines Prandini, 85, restarted an old alarm clock she's had for 30 years to ""give some sound to this time, to give some life to this time"" at home. The clampdown later was extended to cover all of Italy. After about a month, Toniolo's father returned home to Sardinia.

Marzio and his grandfather Gino play a game of cards at home. Things began settling down. But the real concern was Gino, who suffers from short-term memory loss. ""At the start, we were really afraid and did not let him go out. My grandmother used to go to church but when my grandfather started getting worse, she stopped,"" Toniolo said.

Gino and his wife Ines sleep at home on the 16th day of quarantine. Gino would go to bed early and wake up at 10 p.m. convinced it was breakfast time. He could not understand why he had to stay inside and ""coronavirus"" meant nothing to him, so the family told him the Spanish Flu had returned.

Marzio's family gather to watch a live broadcast of Pope Francis giving an extraordinary global blessing to an empty St. Peter's Square, where he urged the world to see the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) crisis as a test of solidarity and a reminder of basic values. The Spanish flu hit between 1918-1920 and people of Gino's generation heard accounts about it when they were young. ""He knew what that was and he started to understand,"" Toniolo said.

Gino goes for a walk close to his home. Gino now wears a mask and goes for a walk, sitting on a bench while neighbours keep a discreet, watchful eye. Bianca also helps Gino adapt. ""No, grandpa, there's coronavirus about. You can't kiss me!"" she told him.

Marzio takes a picture as he participates in a video conference call with colleagues and the headmaster of the primary school where he teaches, to see how everybody's classes are doing. Toniolo and his wife Chiara send their students lessons and homework project via the internet. On Sunday, Italy announced a gradual easing of restrictions.

Story Toniolo, his wife and daughter look forward to moving into their new home when possible, knowing that, if needed, they are just metres away from the older generation. It will continue to be a family affair."

As a first-time mother with no idea what to expect, Nancy Pedroza was convinced the hospital was the safest place to have her baby.

That conviction turned to doubt when in late March most U.S. states ordered residents to stay home and hospitals and doctors began taking new precautions to protect pregnant women and their babies against the novel coronavirus sweeping the nation.

Pedroza holds on to Morgan as she experiences contractions while taking a brisk walk with Nichollette Jones, her doula, to speed up Pedroza's contractions. So, at 40 weeks pregnant, she turned to a midwife to help her have a home birth. She and her partner Ryan Morgan were about to become parents in the middle of a pandemic. ""Thing were changing so fast,"" said Pedroza, 27, who lives with her partner at her parents' house in Fort Worth, Texas. She had to go alone to all her visits with her obstetrician where before she had brought either Morgan, her father or a doula, a birth assistant.

Pedroza lies on a bed in front of Jones, Taylor and Morgan as he helps to pump her breastmilk to try and speed up her contractions. But what really scared her was the uncertainty of who would be allowed to stand by her side at the hospital when the baby came into the world. She would have to choose between Morgan and her doula. The hospital would allow only one and warned her the policy could change and it might bar all visitors. ""It was scary to feel like I might have to do it alone,"" she said, noting that the doctors and nurses were not the same as those who had supported her throughout her pregnancy. ""It's nothing like having someone there that you care about and cares about you that's willing to hold your hand and tell you this is going to be OK.""

Pedroza attends an appointment with her licensed midwives Susan Taylor who checks her stomach, and Amanda Prouty in Taylor's home office at her house. As COVID-19 puts the globe on pause and changes every aspect of daily life, women are entering motherhood with a mixture of anxiety, fear and frustration. Some countries, although not the United States, have banned everyone from the delivery room. Others are separating women who become sick from their newborns. By early April, with her baby past due and learning Medicaid would not cover a home birth, Pedroza considered giving birth at home without any medical assistance.

Pedroza experiences contractions. She got in touch with midwife Susan Taylor on Facebook, who not only lowered her fee but offered up her own home when Pedroza's mother became uneasy about the idea of her grandchild being born in her bathroom or bedroom. But Pedroza was running out of time. Legally the midwife had to transfer Pedroza's care to a hospital if she went past 42 weeks of pregnancy. A sonogram showed the baby's fluid levels were low, which can cause complications during birth.

Pedroza is supported by Jones and Morgan as she experiences contractions while laboring. After a membrane sweep, visit to a chiropractor, a brisk walk and using a breast pump to stimulate labor, the contractions started. After laboring several hours in a birthing tub in Taylor's home, Pedroza started pushing but the baby's heart rate suddenly dropped from 130 to 30, so the midwives called an ambulance.

Pedroza experiences contractions as she is placed onto an ambulance stretcher to be taken to hospital by paramedics. Masked emergency workers put Pedroza onto a stretcher and wheeled her to an ambulance that took her and Morgan to Texas Health Harris Methodist Hospital Southwest around 1 a.m. Taylor rode with her in the ambulance, monitoring the baby's heartbeat.

Pedroza is carried into an ambulance on a stretcher, to be taken to hospital. But once at the hospital, her midwives had to leave. ""Once I got the epidural administered and calmed me down a little bit and realizing I'd still be able to do this myself without possibly having a C-section and hearing the baby's heartbeat on the monitor it brought me so much comfort that I didn't care I was at the hospital at that point,"" said Pedroza, who worked as a massage therapist before becoming pregnant.

Prouty watches 2-day old footage of the birth of Kai Rohan Morgan, recorded by his father Ryan, of Pedroza giving birth. After laboring with a mask on for hours, at 5:55 a.m. on April 8 a healthy baby boy named Kai Rohan Morgan was born, weighing 8 pounds and 5 ounces. The hospital gave her and Morgan masks to wear anytime someone entered their room. Some staff also wore masks and gloves when they helped with breast feeding and took their vital signs.

Taylor takes two-day old Kai's temperature while checking if he has tongue tie, an oral condition that can potentially cause issues with feeding, during a newborn screening at the house of Kai's maternal grandparents.

Story ""It's already kind of scary thinking that it's a possibility that you're going to be in an environment that is contaminated or that puts you at risk or your baby at risk,"" Pedroza said. ""What puts me on edge more is seeing everyone with that attire and being very adamant about wearing it."""

The shifts are long and the scenes are heartbreaking inside a Maryland hospital where nurses and doctors have been treating coronavirus patients for weeks, unable to let family inside to visit loved ones on their death beds.

One of the hardest moments of a recent work day for registered nurse Julia Trainor was intubating a patient, and then calling the patient's husband so he could talk to his wife. He was not allowed in the hospital.

""I had to put him on the phone and hold the phone to her ear as he told her that he loved her so much, and then I had to wipe away her tears,"" says Trainor, who works in a surgical intensive care unit. ""I'm used to seeing very sick patients and I'm used to patients dying, but nothing quite like this.""

""The hardest moment was a young woman who died and her family wasn't able to be here with her,"" Bowers said. ""I think right now, it's just frustrating and scary just not knowing what comes next."" Dr. Kyle Fischer, 35, an emergency medicine doctor who is caring for COVID-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""Since it's a new virus, we don't have any experience with it. For most diseases I am used to seeing it and taking care of it and this, I don't have any starting place. I know what I'm hearing from New York, I've read all of the papers it seems like, but no one knows what the correct answers are, so there's a huge amount of uncertainty and people are really, really sick. So it's hard to second guess whether or not you are doing the right thing when you think you are but you never quite know,"" said Fischer. Kaitlyn Martiniano, 25, a registered nurse who works at a biocontainment unit with COVID-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift. ""We have a lot of patients and they are pretty sick right now but we have not yet been hit as hard as New York or Seattle, so I feel like we are very lucky with that so far. Every day you have to just be optimistic."" Said Martiniano. ""I think the reason that we are not being hit as hard right now is because so many things are closed, and because so many people are staying at home."" Jacqueline Hamil, 30, a registered nurse who is caring for COVID-19 patients in an emergency department, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""The hardest moment of my shift today, I was in charge, and we had a really sick patient that was in a really, really small room and usually, when we have sick crashing patients, we can have a ton of resources and a ton of staff go in and help with the nurse and the doctors that are taking care of that patient. But due to the patient being ruled out for the coronavirus, we could only have five or six people in the room at a time and putting on all the gowns and gloves and masks and face shields to protect us in case the patient does have coronavirus, it takes a while, so the nurse that was in there, ended up being in the room for you know 6, 7 hours with minimal breaks and it was hard being in charge and knowing that she was stuck in the room and really nothing I could do to help her,"" Hamil said. Lisa Mehring, 45, a registered nurse who works in a biocontainment unit with COVID-19 patients, poses for a photograph after a 12.5-hour shift. ""Seeing these new moms have babies has been the hardest moment along with having do their pumping for the new moms and them not being able to be with their newborn children, it's hard to think of the family that they are missing,"" Mehring said.

Story The highly infectious COVID-19 disease caused by the novel coronavirus has infected more than 580,000 people across the United States and killed nearly 24,000. In Maryland, where residents have been ordered to stay at home since March 30 to stem the spread of the disease, around 9,000 have tested positive for the virus and more than 260 have died. After finishing what for many was a more than 12-hour shift, some nurses and doctors at one hospital shared with Reuters the hardest moments of their days. The hospital asked that it not be named. The medical workers agreed that one of the toughest parts of the job - more than the exhausting schedule or adjusting to work in a new unit - was witnessing the toll on patients and families.

Capadngan, 29, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift Because of the hospital's no-visitor policy, which was implemented to prevent further spread of the virus, the medical staff must care for the patients' physical needs and offer as much emotional support as they can muster in the absence of the patients' families. ""The hardest moment during the shift was just seeing COVID patients die helpless and without their family members beside them,"" says Ernest Capadngan, a nurse in the hospital's biocontainment unit.

Wilson, 53, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""There is a lot of unknowns and with that unknown is a lot of anxiety and stress that we're not used to dealing with,"" said Wilson. Communicating with the families has weighed heavily on the hospital staff. Staff cannot bend the no-visit rules, even when a family calls in desperation. ""I had a patient fall out of bed today and I had to call his wife and tell her and she couldn't come see him, even though she pleaded and begged to come see him,"" says Tracey Wilson, a nurse practitioner.

Fare, 25, poses for a photograph after a 13-hour shift. ""My team has been really great to me. We've worked really well together and we've really come together in this crisis. We don't really know each other, we all come from different units within the same hospital, so for us to come together and work so well as a team, it's been a journey but I think that's what is giving me hope,"" said Fare. ""One of the hardest moments was having to see a family member of a COVID patient say goodbye over an iPad,"" says Tiffany Fare, a nurse in the biocontainment unit. ""You can't see your loved one and then they're gone.""

Mack, 46, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""The Covid-19 spread has affected a lot of livelihood, a lot of people's lives. It has created a crisis, death in general. So I would like to ask not one single person, but all people worldwide, to converge and join the platform that this is something that nobody can fight individually,"" said Mack. There are very few opportunities to rest during a shift, although colleagues look out for one another and try to cover for each other when someone needs a break. Cheryll Mack, a registered nurse in the emergency room, says she tries to get outside for 15 minutes during the day to breathe. ""It has given me relief, just fresh air,"" Mack says.

Bell, 41, poses for a photograph after a six-hour shift. ""The hardest thing in all of this, has been taking care of fellow healthcare providers. It really hits home and it's really scary when you see someone that could be you coming in and now you're taking care of them. It's also hitting home that once healthcare providers start getting sick, who is going to be taking care of the public,"" Bell said. Each shift concludes with a similar decontamination drill. Nurses and doctors must remove their personal protective equipment and shower immediately before coming in contact with their family at home. ""I take a very long, very hot shower. And then I usually sit on the couch and... read a book or watch some mindless reality show in order to destress,"" says Martine Bell, a nurse practitioner.

Dr. Bontempo, 50, poses for a photograph after a nine-hour shift. ""I'm used to treating sick patients. I treat sick patients all the time. It's very different knowing that the patient you are treating, is actually a risk to you as well. That's the main difference here. No one who works in hospitals is afraid of treating sick people. Just want to keep staff safe and the patients safe at the same time,"" said Bontempo. Laura Bontempo, an emergency medicine physician, says she removes her work clothing and gear in a decontamination tent she has set up outside her home, and then wraps herself in a towel and runs inside to shower. Then she puts the scrubs in the washing machine by themselves to not contaminate any other items.

Sheehan, 27, poses for a photograph after a 12-hour shift. ""I think the hardest moment has been the fear that lives within all of us. There is a lot of unknown right now. We fear what's going to happen tomorrow, how the emergency department will look next week when we come in. We have fears about our own colleagues, whether they will fall ill. We also fear that we could be asymptomatic carriers and bring this virus home to our families and our loved ones. There has been a lot of fear over our supplies and whether we'll run out. And then obviously there is the fear that we will see patients and not be able to do everything we normally can to help save patients' lives,"" said Sheehan."

When casino owner Kang Qiang (pictured below) looks out the window of his 20th floor office in this city on the remote Cambodian coast, he sees construction cranes sitting idle.

The Chinese-funded gambling enclave of Sihanoukville has suffered a double blow. Travel restrictions imposed in recent weeks to slow the global coronavirus pandemic have deepened the effects of a ban last year on lucrative online gambling.

Kang Qiang sits in his office at his casino Dong Yuan in 2020. But Kang is betting on a future beyond the pandemic, banking on the return of money from China to finish transforming the scrappy frontier town into a gleaming metropolis. In a sign of his confidence, Kang's casino has installed gold urinals.

Golden urinals stand inside Chinese businessman Kang Quiang's casino in 2020. ""This city is just starting, there is a lot of potential,"" says Kang, 60. ""I love it. Sihanoukville gives you a feeling of freedom and no control."" For Kang and others, the city is like the China of several decades ago - with all of the promise and none of the competition. The current idle is only a blip. ""China is huge, there will always be people interested in Sihanoukville,"" says Yin Hongsi, a 30-year-old from Chengdu who hires workers for one of the casinos. ""You don't need to worry if the Chinese will come back."" The boom town on the Cambodian coast has a deep water port and is part of China's Belt and Road initiative. In the next three years, Sihanoukville will also host both the Southeast Asian Games and a meeting of regional leaders.

Story As Chinese money has swept across Southeast Asia, Cambodia has become one of the most visible examples of the investment, with authoritarian Prime Minister Hun Sen doing all he can to strengthen ties to Beijing. In Sihanoukville, most of the money has been private, and the biggest share has gone into some 70 casinos - all of which are being ordered to shut from April 1 as a temporary measure to help slow the spread of coronavirus.

People gather around gambling tables in the casino area of the Nanhai Pearl Casino Hotel in 2019. The casinos have reshaped the city's landscape so frequently that locals struggle to recognize it. The contrasts can be jarring. Inside casinos, wads of U.S. hundred-dollar bills pile up in batches of $10,000 beside white marble ashtrays.

Children of Cambodian construction workers play in front of their temporary housing near a construction site in Chinatown in 2019. Outside, streets are coated in fine orange dust and pedestrians cross rivulets of sewage on scraps of plywood. It's a disconnect familiar to anyone who lives on China's margins. ""China speed"", exclaims Gavin Gao, a gleeful young Chinese tech entrepreneur from Chengdu who has chosen to stick things out. ""Sihanoukville is going at China speed ... Here is China 2.0!""

Makeshift tents where Cambodian construction workers live, stand in front of a construction site in 2019. Cambodians have mixed feelings about the Chinese. Their arrival brought money and jobs - and now their sudden absence is causing problems. ""People used to say 'Sihanoukville is the best'. There are lots of Chinese and lots of money,'"" says Siv Tia, a 69-year-old who makes a few dollars a day selling drinks in the market. ""Now they say 'everyone in Sihanoukville has a big bank loan'"". The collapse of a half-built Chinese-owned building last year, killing dozens, fuelled resentment in the town. So did the constant noise of construction, rising crime and rubbish piled in the streets.

Story ""The growth was just phenomenal, too fast!"" says Transport Minister Sun Chanthol. ""Now things are slowing down so it's a good opportunity for us to catch up."" The expatriates' confidence is buoyed by China's apparent success in fighting the coronavirus pandemic. As cases skyrocket elsewhere in the world, zero local transmissions have been reported on some days in China, where the virus originated. ""They got it under control,"" says Bob Zhao, an earnest 28-year-old from Shandong who came to Sihanoukville seeking his fortune and found it as a sales consultant for a Chinese property developer. ""In China there are so many competitors. They've been to good schools, have good social experience. They are better than you. And the pay is low,"" he says. ""The opportunity here is better.""

The Chinese owned Xihu resort Hotel stands in 2020. Zhao sits in a window-lined atrium of a half a billion-dollar hotel, casino and apartment complex on the beachfront. It broke ground last August, just as the online gambling ban was announced, and has seen a sharp slowdown in sales because of the coronavirus, but is still on track to open in two years. Zhao ticks off reasons Cambodia is appealing: it's a U.S. dollar economy, Hun Sen is close to China and is a longtime, stable autocrat. ""Our money is safe,"" he says.

Story Casino manager Yin has been making ""at least double"" what he would in China by working in Sihanoukville, but he acknowledges the flood of Chinese money has led to surging prices and the growing piles of rubbish. Still, he says the Chinese money has sparked the economy in what he sees as a forgotten country. ""It seems like other countries are not interested in Cambodia, like America and Europe,"" he says. ""China is interested."" Kang, the casino owner, is from Guangzhou, one of China's biggest and most-developed cities. But he is convinced his future is on the dusty streets of Sihanoukville despite his casino losing money since November. ""Persistence means victory,"" he says."

The complaint is the latest salvo from voting rights activists, who have filed dozens of lawsuits around the country to increase ballot access, such as universal vote-by-mail, in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

Wisconsin was at the center of the battle in April, when a last-minute effort by Democratic Governor Tony Evers to postpone the primary election was stymied after Republican legislative leaders challenged his order in court. With many polling places shut down due to a lack of poll workers, many voters waited in long lines, risking infection.

Monday’s lawsuit, filed in federal court in Madison, the capital, said tens of thousands of voters were disenfranchised after they “encountered obstacles at almost every stage of the election process,” including crowded poll places and thousands of absentee ballots that were either not delivered or arrived too late.

The burdens fell disproportionately on minority, disabled and immuno-compromised voters, according to the lawsuit, which was filed by Disability Rights Wisconsin, Black Leaders Organizing for Communities and three individual Wisconsinites.

A spokesman for the state elections commission, which was named as a defendant, declined to comment on pending litigation.

Also on Monday, the League of Women Voters of New Jersey and other groups sued New Jersey in federal court, arguing that the state’s signature-match requirement for mail-in ballots disenfranchises thousands of voters, particularly immigrants, minorities, the elderly and the disabled.

The two lawsuits join a plethora of others as activists warn that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak could throw November’s election into chaos without immediate steps to make it easier for voters to cast ballots by mail.

Many of the lawsuits are backed by Democrats, who argue they are trying to protect voters’ rights in a public health crisis and that Republican resistance is intended to disenfranchise minority and other voters who tend to vote Democratic. Marc Elias, the attorney leading the party’s efforts, has pending cases in 17 different states

Republicans have argued that loosening restrictions could increase the potential for voter fraud, though examples in the United States are exceedingly rare. President Donald Trump, a Republican, has echoed those arguments, saying without evidence that mail-in voting is rampant with fraud."
